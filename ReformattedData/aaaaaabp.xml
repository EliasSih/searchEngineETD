and their work</field><field name="creator">Tyler, Mark A.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on research conducted with Technical and Further Education (TAFE) teachers from Queensland and Western Australia. The research is located atthe intersection where teachers&#8217; identities met the discourse of new vocationalism. Scholars have highlighted the tensions that this discourse has produced in therelationships between TAFE and its teachers, and noted that TAFE teachers are pressured to change their subjectivities to reflect themselves more effectively asworkers in an educational market focused on economic imperatives. This is often in contrast to these teachers&#8217; personal notions of themselves as liberal educators, with afocus on lifelong learning, personal transformation, collaborative relationships and social responsibility. This research was driven by the possibility that the concept of &#8216;critical spirit&#8217; might provide a means for TAFE teachers to stand their ground in relation to the continued reshaping of the TAFE teacher terrain produced by the adoption of the new vocational discourse.This interpretative research was conceptualised by synthesising sociocultural perspectives of discourse as a reality building tool (Gee, 2005) with notions of criticalthinker dispositions referred to as critical spirit (Siegel, 1988; Oxman-Michelli, 1992). The elements of critical spirit: openmindedness, independence of mind,wholeheartedness, intellectual responsibility and respect for others (Oxman-Michelli,1992) were used as central components to the development of a coding framework forthe explication of critical spirit from TAFE teacher artefacts and in positioning critical spirit as a discourse. An examination of 12 TAFE teacher case narrative artefacts revealed that elements of critical spirit were evident. Subsequent participantcredibility checks and semi-structured interviews provided diverse data related to teacher embodiment of a critical spirit in relation to the building of certain teacher identities. In some cases participants expressed that their identities were bolstered by engaging in a critical spirit discourse, others cautioned its public embodiment, suggesting that deploying critical spirit made them more visible to surveillance and control. The major finding of this research was that an explicit engagement with acritical spirit discourse was of value to these TAFE teachers. Furthermore, this critical spirit discourse was seen to perform the work of a borderland discourse (Gee, 2005; Alsup, 2006). It afforded a means to traverse the terrain &#8220;between disparate personal and professional subjectivities&#8221; (Alsup, 2006, p. 5).The research also uncovered other discourses pertinent to participant artefacts. These were identified as a test of fortitude discourse and a community of support discourse.It was postulated that these would extend the critical spirit discourse by adding to Oxman-Michelli&#8217;s (1992) five elements of critical spirit. The findings suggested littleevidence to support this position.The significance of this research was in: (a) the production of a methodological construct for explicating particular notions of critical spirit; (b) its contribution to furthering understandings of the professional lives of TAFE teachers and their workworld; and (c) the value that a critical spirit discourse had in strengthening these TAFE teachers&#8217; notions of themselves and their effectiveness. Its contribution tosubstantial knowledge was in its expansion of our understanding of teacher identities within the Vocational Education and Training sector in Australia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TAFE;</field><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">Technical</field><field name="subject">and</field><field name="subject">Further</field><field name="subject">Education;</field><field name="subject">Technical</field><field name="subject">and</field><field name="subject">Further</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">Queensland;</field><field name="subject">Western</field><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">vocationalism</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006204/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A realist review of evidence to guide targeted approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention among immigrants living in high-income countries</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Tadgh</field><field name="description">Abstract 

HIV/AIDS is a global epidemic with the greatest burden in terms of prevalence, morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia and, more recently, the Caribbean. Immigrants from these regions of birth now make up a significant proportion of people living with HIV in many high-income countries, including Australia. The higher priority accorded to people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds in Australian national and local HIV/AIDS strategies generates a broad question on &#145;how&#146; to implement HIV prevention interventions with immigrants to address what are often atypical modes of HIV transmission and observed disparities in areas such as later presentation with HIV. 

HIV prevention in Australia has included whole-of-population approaches alongside targeted approaches, which address HIV prevention with specific groups &#150; usually those disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS such as gay men or injecting drug users. Targeted health promotion interventions for immigrants have also formed part of the HIV response in Australia. Immigrants in Australia may have acquired HIV prior to their first arrival in Australia, on subsequent travel abroad, or within Australia. A key gap in our evidence base in Australia includes what we can learn from interventions implemented in other high-income countries to guide new, or strengthen existing, approaches to culturally appropriate primary and secondary HIV prevention with immigrants locally. 

Typically it is taken as a given that prevention interventions will be more effective if they are culturally appropriate to the population they serve, and a range of strategies and activities are used to achieve this. However, there is rarely an examination of what mechanisms &#150; the &#145;change elements&#146; or program theories of the intervention &#150; contribute to culturally appropriate interventions. This research, in the form of a realist review of evidence, sought to &#145;unpack&#146; the mechanisms for achieving cultural appropriateness in HIV prevention interventions with immigrants that have been implemented in contexts similar to Australia. Thus the broad question the research sought to answer was &#145;How and why do interventions work (or not), for which groups of immigrants, and in what contexts?&#146; The review of evidence in HIV prevention included a span of interventions from community-level approaches using mass media through to interventions delivered at a group level to immigrants. 

Systematic searches were carried out on major public health databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, PsychInfo) and Google Scholar to find peer-reviewed and grey literature relevant to HIV prevention among immigrants. Two types of studies contributed to the review of evidence &#150; studies of interventions and qualitative studies of immigrants&#146; views on HIV/AIDS prevention &#150; in order to bring together &#145;expert&#146; and &#145;lay&#146; understandings of HIV prevention among immigrants. Simultaneously, a scan of the literature mapped preliminary mechanisms contributing to cultural appropriateness in HIV prevention interventions with immigrants. This preliminary set of seven mechanisms &#150; &#145;authenticity&#146;, &#145;understanding&#146;, &#145;consonance&#146;, &#145;specificity&#146;, &#145;embeddedness&#146;, &#146;endorsement&#146; and &#145;framing&#146; &#150; were theorised as the key, rather than the only, interrelated mechanisms contributing to cultural appropriateness in interventions with immigrants. These preliminary mechanisms were then tested, revised and refined against evidence &#150; 74 &#145;grey&#146; and peer-reviewed studies and reports relevant to HIV prevention with immigrants &#150; found in systematic searches.  

The evidence indicates that the pivotal mechanisms contributing to cultural appropriateness in HIV prevention interventions with immigrants are &#145;understanding&#146; and &#145;consonance&#146; &#150; ensuring that language (usually the &#145;mother tongue&#146;) and cultural values are included as key elements in the development and implementation of the intervention. &#145;Authenticity&#146;, &#145;specificity&#146; and &#145;embeddedness&#146;were moderately important in contributing to cultural appropriateness &#150; mechanisms that dealt with staffing, targeting through ethnicity and using settings for interventions &#150; from the evidence included in the review. Finally, there was mixed evidence for the roles of &#145;endorsement&#146; and &#145;framing&#146;, which suggests that gaining community endorsement or partnering initiatives with immigrants or immigrant community institutions were the least critical mechanisms in contributing to cultural appropriateness in terms of HIV prevention interventions. Further research is needed to examine the relationships between these seven mechanisms and any impacts they contribute to the effectiveness of interventions and HIV-related health outcomes among immigrants.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">culturally appropriate</field><field name="subject">review of evidence</field><field name="subject">targeted prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100707.104732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Heaven, as it is on Earth: Representations of literary heavens in contemporary literature, with a focus on Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones</field><field name="creator">Tidy, Samantha Ellen</field><field name="description">This exegesis examines the landscape of heaven depicted in the contemporary novel, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.  I examine the various characteristics of the heaven (or 'afterlife') depicted in Sebold's novel, with the aim of ascertaining the narrative effects of using this device.        Using Ingrid Daemmrich's analysis of the paradisiacal motif in literature as a framework (Daemmrich, I 1997, Studies on Themes and Motifs in Literature: Enigmatic Bliss, The Paradise Motif in Literature, Peter Lang, New York), I reveal characteristics in The Lovely Bones that are both consistent with and challenge traditional literary representations of heaven and which therefore demonstrate that the text utilises the established literary motif of heaven for symbolism and meaning, but in a contemporary context.      I explore the growing trend of contemporary literary heavens by reviewing two other literary heavens that are relevant to this scholarship. I examine where as writers and readers, we ascertain our concept of heaven (in society's religious foundations and from prior literature), and for the relevance of the key text, I briefly discuss the author's likely cultural influences. Having established the novel's lack of alignment with a religious version of heaven, I then examine the nature of and the narrative effect of, the personalised heaven depicted in the novel, The Lovely Bones.      In doing so, I explore one of the new portraits of heaven in literature, an example which represents a growing trend away from portraying a classic edenic heaven shared by all humanity (and traditional to literary representations of heaven), toward a contemporary, personalised heaven that seeks to meet the wants and desires of the individual in our modern society. With reference to literature's ability to reflect back to us, our society's beliefs and values, I examine what this new portrait of heaven reveals about society.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INVESTIGATION INTO THE REGULATION OF INOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (IMPDH)</field><field name="creator">Elaine Thomas</field><field name="description">Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyses the key step in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis at the branch point of GTP and ATP production. Mammals have two ubiquitous, catalytically indistinguishable isoforms, IMPDH type I and type II, and these are considered functionally interchangeable. Each contains a Bateman domain known to serve as energy-sensing / allosteric regulatory modules in a range of unrelated proteins. Mutations in the Bateman domain of type I, which do not affect catalytic activity, cause the retina-degenerative disease, retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The central hypothesis of this thesis is that IMPDH is regulated. In particular, that regulation occurs in an isoform specific manner and that mutations causal to RP affect enzyme regulation. Here we have visualised, including in real-time, the redistribution or clustering of IMPDH into linear macrostructures in a time-dependent manner which appeared to be intimately associated with changes in intracellular nucleotide levels. Data presented suggest the significance of IMPDH clustering is unlikely to be associated with substrate channelling, via interaction with other proteins in the de novo biosynthesis pathway, or enhanced protein stability. Although both isoforms responded similarly to fluctuations in intracellular nucleotide levels, type I had a higher propensity to spontaneously cluster into macrostructures compared to type II. This propensity to cluster was found to be conferred by the N-terminal 244 amino acids, which includes the Bateman domain, using a series of type I / type II chimera proteins. A comparative and novel approach revealed isoform-specific purine nucleotide binding characteristics. Type I bound ATP and type II bound AMP, via a mechanism involving the Bateman domain, resulting in conformational changes in IMPDH. This nucleotide binding was not associated with allosteric activation of IMPDH catalytic activity. The RP-causing mutation, R224P, abolished ATP binding and this correlated with an altered propensity to cluster. Collectively these data (i) show IMPDH distribution is regulated by the intracellular environment (ii) demonstrate that the IMPDH isoforms are modulated in a differential manner by AMP and ATP by a mechanism involving the Bateman domain, (iii) indicate communication between the Bateman domain and the active site and (iv) demonstrate that a RP-causing mutation compromises such regulation. From a broader perspective, this work raises the possibility that the nucleotide sensing properties of the Bateman domain in IMPDH serve to regulate IMPDH and co-ordinate nucleotide homeostasis, thereby giving rise to cellular plasticity in an isoform-specific manner to meet the requirements of the cellular environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IMPDH</field><field name="subject">CBS</field><field name="subject">Bateman domain</field><field name="subject">retinitis pigmentosa</field><field name="subject">protein cluster</field><field name="subject">purine metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Space and Performance of Virtual Reality</field><field name="creator">Neal Harvey</field><field name="description">In this dissertation&#8217;s study of virtual reality (VR), I focus my attention on two prominent types of VR: real virtualities and virtual realities. I argue that both are composed of performative acts of spatial production and that through the study of those acts, researchers can isolate and describe the difference between these two tropes of virtual reality. My thesis focuses on Henri Lefebvre&#8217;s theorisation of social space as the most detailed and appropriate spatial theory for such a process while Victor Turner&#8217;s liminal theory of social and ritual performance provides the necessary performative methodology to complement Lefebvre&#8217;s. My use of these theories allows researchers to identify the difference between social spaces that produce new spaces and practices, and those which reinforce the spatial paradigm that generated them. The process of identifying these differences further clarifies Lefebvre&#8217;s complicated description of social space, but it also provides a platform for researchers to distinguish between the two different types of virtual reality. Through a detailed examination of three ostensibly different examples of VR, I argue that virtual realities ought to be considered primarily as realities made virtual while real virtualities should be discussed as virtualities made real. In doing so this thesis advances the study and application of Lefebvrean thought whilst opening up new directions for virtuality studies. I have chosen to explore three case studies that, through their difference, foreground their spatial and performative nature. By focusing on distinctly different and atypical case studies, I highlight the methodology described in this project and its suitability (or otherwise) for discussing VR. Focusing firstly on Google, I explore the virtual reality of the World Wide Web, perhaps the most ubiquitous example of a virtual reality. The sheer pervasiveness, uptake and constant evolution of the World Wide Web means that it requires constant academic attention. Google is the page through which a staggering 53.3% of Web users access the Internet and to say that most people are actually browsing Google&#8217;s web instead of the actual web is by no means an under statement. Google, like all other search engines, has its own formula for determining results and rankings for search queries. Google is not, as many people would like to think, an objective map of the Internet. It relies so heavily on users&#8217; data in relation to their search query (which pages they click on, how long they spend there, whether they click back) that apart from the virtual algorithms that it uses to articulate the process Google could be said to be constituted solely by the real world practices of its users. Secondly I explore an example of the other type of VR, a real virtuality. Though the Gothic cathedral may not traditionally fall under the rubric of virtuality studies, the building itself provides an excellent example of the interaction of space and performance required to bring into existence that which was not there before. The Gothic cathedral is a concrete resolution of the actual/virtual dialectic and provides a unique opportunity to test my methodology&#8217;s ability to describe both types of VR and highlight the distinction between them. Whereas much of what constitutes virtuality studies centres on what I am calling the virtualisation of reality (online chat rooms, virtual banking, etc) &#8211; spaces that represent virtual others of real world entities, the Gothic cathedral represents the reverse of this: the realisation of a virtuality. The Gothic cathedral is unique in the context of this thesis for it is first and foremost a physical building rather than an onscreen other. It is a real virtuality in this thesis because, while concrete, there are some aspects of its reality that remain essential rather than formal and are dependent upon parishioners&#8217; performance in order to be made &#8216;real.&#8217; The final case study of this project represents the future usefulness of my methodology. In following up the work on exploring the suitability of describing a Gothic cathedral alongside Google, the last chapter of my dissertation explores the suitability of describing theatrical space as a VR. Similar to the Google chapter, this chapter focuses on a digital VR tool recently developed by Joanne Tompkins at the University of Queensland called the Online Theatre Project. The Online Theatre Project (OTP) represents a unique approach to the documentation, digital conceptualisation and archival problems that present themselves to a working theatre company in its everyday practice. The OTP is a server-based modeling and archival tool that allows users to draw, model and design their theatre production in real-time and then house their data on a remotely accessible server. Any notional description of theatrical space is necessarily a slippery one, given the relative youth of such studies and this project positions itself in this ever evolving debate by suggesting that the Online Theatre Project actually provides a description of what theatrical space entails where others have not. This thesis argues that VR space is dependent upon a constant spatial and performative production process. It illustrates how Lefebvre&#8217;s conceptualisation of the production process is most suitable for describing that production process and argues that re-imagining Lefebvre&#8217;s definition with the assistance of Turner&#8217;s everyday performative theory of liminality affords researchers the chance to differentiate between real virtualities and virtual realities. In doing so this thesis advances the study of VR, by proving that it is possible to discuss such complicated subjects in spatial and performative terms instead of the dominant real or un-real ones. Further, I outline the necessary adaptation of Lefebvre&#8217;s spatial triad that can be undertaken to prove its usefulness in many other aspects of VR studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">space, performance, virtual reality, Lefebvre, theatre, Google, gothic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on Consumption-based Asset Pricing Models</field><field name="creator">Bin Li</field><field name="description">Consumption-based asset pricing models (CCAPMs) connect asset returns with consumption growth. The poor empirical performance of early consumption models has led to the development of a number of more sophisticated models. Nevertheless, most models focus on the US markets, and very few CCAPMs have been examined in the Australian context. Given the importance of CCAPMs, the purpose of this thesis is to examine the connections between asset returns in the Australian market and consumption variables. The thesis also extends the analysis to examine CCAPMs in an international setting. There are four essays in this thesis. The first essay undertakes a thorough investigation of the empirical support for consumption-based asset pricing models in the context of several major Australian asset classes. Using the generalised method of moments (GMM) econometric approach, my study begins with the classic CCAPM originally tested by Hansen and Singleton (1982, 1983). The empirical analysis is then extended to test more-recent specifications of the CCAPM, including the habit-formation models of Abel (1990) and Campbell and Cochrane (2000), and the time nonseparable model of Epstein and Zin (1991). For each of the models examined, the results provide cautious support for the CCAPM especially in relation to equity returns. Size-sorted portfolios (in particular, portfolios of small stocks) and fixed-income returns cause the CCAPM restriction to be rejected. It also presents results that raise questions over the benefits from extensions of the classic CCAPM, such as habit-persistence and recursive utility models. The second essay studies the empirical performance of a linearised version of the classic CCAPM in the Australian market. The studies of Faff and Oliver (1998) and Faff (1998) are extended by employing more recent data and examining 25 size/BM portfolios as well as industry portfolios. It is found that by using the lagged portfolio returns, the linearised CCAPM for both industry portfolios and 25 size/BM portfolios is generally not rejected. The third essay empirically examines conditional CCAPMs where the conditioning variables are consumption factors such as the consumption-wealth ratio proposed by Lettau and Ludvigson (2001a, 2001b), the surplus consumption ratio (Campbell and Cochrane, 1999), and the labour income to consumption ratio (Santos and Veronesi, 2006). Here long-horizon return predictability tests are conducted using these factors and cross-sectional tests on whether these factors are priced using both 25 Size/BM portfolios and industry portfolios. Utilising the Fama-MacBeth (1973) procedure, it is found that conditional models perform better than unconditional models. However, these conditional models do not outperform the Fama-French three-factor model. The fourth essay tests the world CCAPMs. Using data for 17 countries, the following are tested: the classic world CCAPM under the assumption of complete international markets integration, the heterogeneous world CCAPM under the framework of Constantinides and Duffie (1996) and the world habit models. The finding here is that a large risk aversion is needed to resolve the equity premium puzzle for the classic world CCAPM; however, adding a cross-country consumption dispersion factor into the model significantly lowers the coefficients of consumption risk aversion. Unconditional linear factor models are also studied where it is found that the world consumption growth and the dispersion of the cross-sectional consumption growth provide some explanatory basis for the variation in the cross section of excess stock returns. More sophisticated consumption models perform better than the classic world CCAPM. This thesis makes a worthwhile contribution to the research literature on CCAPMs in Australia which up to now has been limited. It performs out-of-sample tests of major CCAPMs utilising several Australian asset classes. It not only provides some insights into the return predictability of the aggregate market index in Australia, but also presents some evidence of the explanation of the cross section of stock returns using consumption variables.

Many important real-world problems have been formulated as supervised learning problems. The assumption is that a data set is available containing the correct output (e.g. class label or target value) for each given data point. In many application domains, obtaining the correct outputs (labels) for data points is a costly and time-consuming task. This has provided the motivation for the development of Machine Learning techniques that attempt to minimize the number of labeled data points while maintaining good generalization performance on a given problem. Active Learning is one such class of techniques and is the focus of this thesis. Active Learning algorithms select or generate unlabeled data points to be labeled and use these points for learning. If successful, an Active Learning algorithm should be able to produce learning performance (e.g test set error) comparable to an equivalent supervised learner using fewer labeled data points. Theoretical, algorithmic and experimental Active Learning research has been conducted and a number of successful applications have been demonstrated. However, the scope of many of the experimental studies on Active Learning has been relatively small and there are very few large-scale experimental evaluations of Active Learning techniques. A significant amount of performance variability exists across Active Learning experimental results in the literature. Furthermore, the implementation details and effects of experimental factors have not been closely examined in empirical Active Learning research, creating some doubt over the strength and generality of conclusions that can be drawn from such results. The Active Learning model/system used in this thesis is the Optimal Active Learning algorithm framework with Gaussian Processes for regression problems (however, most of the research questions are of general interest in many other Active Learning scenarios). Experimental and implementation details of the Active Learning system used are described in detail, using a number of regression problems and datasets of different types. It is shown that the experimental results of the system are subject to significant variability across problem datasets. The hypothesis that experimental factors can account for this variability is then investigated. The results show the impact of sampling and sizes of the datasets used when generating experimental results. Furthermore, preliminary experimental results expose performance variability across various real-world regression problems. The results suggest that these experimental factors can (to a large extent) account for the variability observed in experimental results. A novel resampling technique for Optimal Active Learning, called '3-Sets Cross-Validation', is proposed as a practical solution to reduce experimental performance variability. Further results confirm the usefulness of the technique. The thesis then proposes an extension to the Optimal Active Learning framework, to perform learning via membership queries via a novel algorithm named MQOAL. The MQOAL algorithm employs the Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to sample data points for query selection. Experimental results show that MQOAL provides comparable performance to the pool-based OAL learner, using a very generic, simple MCMC technique, and is robust to experimental factors related to the MCMC implementation. The possibility of making queries in batches is also explored experimentally, with results showing that while some performance degradation does occur, it is minimal for learning in small batch sizes, which is likely to be valuable in some real-world problem domains.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active learning</field><field name="subject">probabilistic data selection</field><field name="subject">experimental factor</field><field name="subject">cross-validation</field><field name="subject">membership query</field><field name="subject">gaussian processes</field><field name="subject">markov chain monte carlo</field><field name="subject">batch learning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;Only another mother would understand&#8221; Parents&#8217; experiences of feeding their children with complex medical conditions</field><field name="creator">Lyndal Franklin</field><field name="description">With advances in neonatal, medical and surgical care there are an increasing number of infants and young children surviving with medical conditions. Many of these children have associated complex feeding difficulties as a result of the disruption to early oral feeding experiences and periods of restricted or non-oral feeding. These children are at risk of developing long-term feeding difficulties associated with sub-optimal nutrition and poor appetite regulation, delays in mastering skills that lead to eating and mealtime independence, and disruptive mealtime behaviours. Managing the extraordinary demands associated with feeding and ensuring nutrition for these children can present significant challenges for parents as well as health care professionals involved in their care. Occupational therapists are often core members of multidisciplinary teams providing hospital-based services to these children and their families. Embracing an occupation-centred perspective, participation in feeding and mealtimes are considered important co-occupations for infants, children and their parents and carers that occur within the context of parenting and family life. Understanding these contextual influences and the occupational needs of parents are essential but have been understated in the occupational therapy literature and clinical practice. This thesis describes a qualitative study using a phenomenological perspective to explore the lived experiences of parents of children with complex medical and feeding difficulties. Parents from fourteen families participated in the study. Data collection involved in-depth interviews, family mealtime observations and demographic questionnaires. Key findings indicated that parents experienced a high degree of stress in their everyday lives as a result of their children&#8217;s feeding difficulties, especially in relation to tube-feeding. Mothers&#8217; self-image was devastated because they believed that it was their ultimate responsibility to feed and nourish their children. Differences in how parents identified with and fulfilled their parenting roles and responsibilities emerged, not just in relation to feeding but also for other childcare and domestic activities. Overwhelmingly, it was mothers who assumed the greater share of these parenting responsibilities, and in addition, expressed a sense of responsibility for preserving family unity and the need to get on with family life despite the chronic nature of their children&#8217;s problems. These findings contribute to our understanding of the occupational challenges for parents of these children, especially mothers who have a primary role in feeding, and the impact of feeding disruptions on the lives of their families. This knowledge will assist clinicians providing feeding interventions to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of both parents and other family members. Recommendations for clinical practice are proposed. Limitations of the study are presented along with suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parenting occupations, parent-child co-occupations, mothering, family occupations, feeding, chronic medical conditions, tube-feeding, qualitative inquiry.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kurunpa [Spirit]: Exploring the Psychosocial Determinants of Coronary Heart Disease among Indigenous men in Central Australia</field><field name="creator">Alexander Brown</field><field name="description">The life expectancy (LE) gap experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in one of Australians most enduring health divides. Whilst there are many likely reasons, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) stand as the primary contributor. In particular, it is the almost ten-fold higher mortality from CVD at young ages that distinguishes this epidemic. The reasons for this disparity remain incompletely understood. Current research has focused on the likely contribution of traditional risk factor burdens in Aboriginal people, who demonstrate higher levels of smoking, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Less attention has focused on the potential contribution of disadvantage and its interplay with psychosocial factors. Research on the psychosocial determinants of health, particularly in relation to CVD, has a long pedigree. Social context, particularly inequality between individuals, has assumed its rightful place at the forefront of our understandings of population levels of disease. Among them, socioeconomic position [SEP] and depression are the most robust, and most widely researched. They have not been adequately explored in the context of Aboriginal Australians, nor has the manner in which culture shapes, sustains or transforms disadvantage and psychosocial stress been outlined. The objective of the Men Hearts and Minds (MHM) Study was to identify the possible ways in which social disadvantage may lead to CVD in Aboriginal men in Central Australia and consider the role of psychosocial factors in modifying or mediating this relationship. This required a detailed and multi-disciplinary plan of research, covering the epidemiology of mental illness and chronic diseases, biomedical science, ethnographic field work and qualitative methodologies. Stage I required the development of measurement tools for exploring depression, stress, resilience, mastery and socioeconomic indicators that were valid and robust for use with Aboriginal men within Central Australia. This involved multi-stage qualitative techniques, engaging Aboriginal men, traditional healers (Ngangkari Tjuta) and mental health experts, to define the expressions and construction of mental illness in Aboriginal men. Depression existed, was recognizable, common, and had profound impacts on the social, emotional and physical well-being of Aboriginal men. &#8216;Worry&#8217; was the most recognisable element, and the principle contributor to depression in Aboriginal men. Much of this was focused on the increasingly heavy and cumulative social and cultural burdens experienced throughout Aboriginal men&#8217;s lives, and manifest as a sense of inner turmoil and questioning of self, and of feelings of disconnectedness from all the things of critical importance within their lives. Kurunpa [spirit] was seen as the foundation of vitality and was critical to the physical, emotional and spiritual well-being of Aboriginal people. These findings were then used to interrogate existing psychological testing tools and develop novel measures to explore the interplay of SEP, stress and depression. These tools were then used in a community dwelling sample of Aboriginal men in Central Australia to explore the interaction of SEP, stress and depression and their potential contribution to CVD risk. In total 186 Aboriginal men across urban and remote community settings were assessed. Almost 40% of the sample had elevated depressive symptoms. Depression was highly correlated with standard measures of distress and inversely with mastery. Newly created measures, assessing Chronic Stress, the &#8216;Sense of Injury&#8217; and deprivation, were highly correlated, reliable and fulfilled many validity criteria. There was a high level of cardiovascular risk, which was related to a number of psychosocial factors, particularly depression. Major depression was over 9 times as common in individuals with prevalent CVD. Cardiovascular risk was patterned across social strata, but not evident with the use of routine measures of SEP. Psychosocial factors modified the observed social gradient. In those with high chronic stress, the social gradient in CVD risk gradient was amplified. This pattern was mirrored in those who had been removed or had family forcible removed. Depression was correlated with a number of atherogenic pathways. Smokers were more likely to be depressed, and depression was strongly related to obesity. Individual with high depression scores were more than 20 times more likely to have a Body Mass Index &gt;30. The interplay between the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) (estimated with measures of Heart Rate Variability) and the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis (as measured according to obesity) highlights the interconnections across atherogenic pathways and may frame the cardiometabolic risk and psychosocial pathways to cardiovascular disease in this sample. The phenomenology of cumulative stress, distress and depression within the narratives of Aboriginal men constructed illness as a consequence of the ongoing fight to maintain balance - physically, emotionally and spiritually. From both a social and biological perspective, the construction of depression and heart disease as a consequence of cumulative chronic stress among Aboriginal men was supported in the findings of this work.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal health</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease (CVD)</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">social determinants</field><field name="subject">social gradient</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren).

The method is named the Quantum-inspired Spiking Neural Network (QiSNN) framework. QiSNN represents an integrated wrapper approach. An evolutionary process evolves appropriate feature subsets for a given classification task and simultaneously optimises the neural and learning-related parameters of the network. Unlike other methods, the connection weights of this network are determined by a fast one-pass learning algorithm which dramatically reduces the training time. In its core, QiSNN employs the Thorpe neural model that allows the efficient simulation of even large networks. In QiSNN, the presence or absence of features is represented by a string of concatenated bits, while the parameters of the neural network are continuous. For the exploration of these two entirely different search spaces, a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is developed. The method maintains a population of probabilistic models specialised for the optimisation of either binary, continuous or heterogeneous search spaces while utilising a small and intuitive set of parameters. The EDA extends the Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) proposed by Han and Kim (2002) and was named the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Model EDA (hHM-EDA). The algorithm is compared to numerous contemporary optimisation methods and studied in terms of convergence speed, solution quality and robustness in noisy search spaces. The thesis investigates the functioning and the characteristics of QiSNN using both synthetic feature selection benchmarks and a real-world case study on ecological modelling. By evolving suitable feature subsets, QiSNN significantly enhances the classification accuracy of eSNN. Compared to numerous other feature selection techniques, like the wrapper-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC), QiSNN demonstrates a competitive classification and feature selection performance while requiring comparatively low computational costs.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolving connectionist system</field><field name="subject">Spiking neural network</field><field name="subject">Quantum-inspired</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">Estimation of distribution algorithm</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The introduced Australian oyster blenny, Omobranchus anolius</field><field name="creator">Barker, Jeremy James</field><field name="description">In 2003, an intertidal fish, the Australian oyster blenny (Omobranchus anolius) was discovered in Auckland, New Zealand.

Observers are typically required to monitor displays over extended periods and to execute overt detection responses to the appearance of low probability critical signals. The signals are usually clearly perceivable when observers are alerted to them, but they can be missed in the operating environment. The challenge is to develop a computer application that will accumulate information on a variable, or several variables, over time and identify when the trend in observations has changed. In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in patient monitoring and medical data analysis using decision support systems, smart alarm monitoring systems, expert systems and many other computer aided protocols. The expert systems have the potential to improve clinician performance by accurately executing repetitive tasks, to which humans are ill-suited. Anaesthetists working in the operating theatre are responsible for carrying out a multitude of tasks which requires constant vigilance and thus a need for a smart decision support system has arisen. The decision support tools capable of detecting pathological events can enhance the anaesthetist&#8217;s performance by providing alternative diagnostic information. The main goal of this research was to develop a clinically useful diagnostic alarm system using two different techniques for monitoring a pathological event during anaesthesia. Several techniques including fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, control and monitoring techniques were explored. Firstly, an industrial monitoring system called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software is used and implemented in the form of a prototype system called SCADA monitoring system (SMS). The output of the system in detecting hypovolaemia was classified into three levels; mild, moderate and severe using SCADA&#8217;s InTouch software. In addition, a new GUI display was developed for direct interaction with the anaesthetists. Secondly, a fuzzy logic monitoring system (FLMS) was developed using the fuzzy logic technique. New diagnostic rules and membership functions (MF) were developed using MATLAB. In addition, fuzzy inference system FIS, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system ANFIS and clustering techniques were explored for developing the FLMS&#8217;s diagnostic modules. The raw physiological patient data acquired from an S/5 monitor were converted to a readable format using the DOMonitor application. The data was filtered, preprocessed, and analysed for detecting anaesthesia related events like hypovolaemia. The accuracy of diagnoses generated by SMS and FLMS was validated by comparing their diagnostic information with the one provided by the anaesthetist for each patient. Kappa-analysis was used for measuring the level of agreement between the anaesthetist&#8217;s, SMS&#8217;s, and FLMS&#8217;s diagnoses. In offline analysis both systems were tested with data from 15 patients. The SMS and FLMS achieved an overall agreement level of 87 and 88 percent respectively. It implies substantial level of agreement between SMS or FLMS and the anaesthetists. These diagnostic alarm systems (SMS and FLMS) have shown that evidence-based expert diagnostic systems can diagnose hypovolaemia, with a substantial degree of accuracy, in anaesthetized patients and could be useful in providing decision support to anaesthetists.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smart monitoring systems</field><field name="subject">Anaesthesia monitoring</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy logic patient monitoring</field><field name="subject">SCADA monitoring</field><field name="subject">Alerts during physiological events</field><field name="subject">Warnings during anaesthesia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonsai</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Terry Hsu-Huang</field><field name="description">This thesis includes an introduction to my bonsai container design along with a history of bonsai, discussion of the philosophies of key bonsai masters, the details of two bonsai containers based on Japanese courtyard culture and Japanese architectural philosophy.

The singers recited the lyrics to their songs and recordings of their sung vocals were also obtained, creating a dataset of paired sung and recited words. Interviews with the singers were conducted so that the pronunciation used in reciting could be compared with a more conversational style. Eight vowels were analysed in these three conditions: DRESS, TRAP, THOUGHT, LOT, START, GOOSE, GOAT and PRICE. As well as providing data for phonetic analysis, the interviews elicited information about the singers&#8217; musical influences, and investigated the singers&#8217; stances towards the use of New Zealand English (NZE) in singing. The results of the comparison of singing and speech reflect the singers&#8217; various stances to some extent. Overall, however, there are strikingly few cases where pairs of sung and spoken vowels have similar pronunciations. The predominance of &#8216;American&#8217; vowels in the singing of all three participants, despite stated intentions to use New Zealand forms, suggests that the American-influenced singing style is the default in this context. This finding contrasts with early research on singing pronunciation in popular music, which described the use of American pronunciation in pop music as an act of identity which involved effort and awareness (Trudgill, 1983). The results presented here support the claims of more recent studies which suggest, conversely, that it is the use of non-American accent features which requires a wilful act of identity (Beal, 2009; O'Hanlon, 2006). An important consideration in the interpretation of vowel differences between singing and speech is the role played by the act of singing itself. It has been argued that there may be a general preference for increased sonority in singing (Morrissey, 2008) which would lead to the use of more open vowel sounds. This issue is explored and some evidence is found for a sonority-related effect. However, singing inherent effects like this can only explain a portion of the variability between singing and speaking. Most of the differences between singing and speech appear to be caused by social and stylistic motivations. To investigate why American-influenced pronunciation might be the default in the singing of pop music, a perception experiment was conducted to examine the phenomenon from the perspective of the listener. Participants were played words from a continuum that ranged between bed and bad, and they responded by circling whichever word they heard on a response sheet. The perception of ambiguous tokens was found to differ significantly according to whether or not the words were expected to be spoken or sung. These results are discussed with reference to exemplar theories of speech perception, arguing that the differences between singing and speech arise due to context-specific activation of phonetically detailed memories. This perspective can also be applied to the processes which underlie the production of vowels in sung contexts. Singers draw on their memories of popular music when they sing. Their use of American pronunciation in singing is therefore the result of the fact that a majority of their memories of pop singing involve American-influenced phonetic forms.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociolinguistics</field><field name="subject">Singing</field><field name="subject">Style</field><field name="subject">Phonetics</field><field name="subject">New Zealand English</field><field name="subject">Exemplar theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive transmission for block-fading channels</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Dang Khoa</field><field name="description">Multipath propagation and mobility in wireless communication systems give rise to variations in the amplitude and phase of the transmitted signal, commonly referred to as fading. Many wireless applications are affected by slowly varying fading, where the channel is non-ergodic, leading to non-reliable transmission during bad channel realizations. These communication scenarios are well modeled by the block-fading channel, where the reliability is quantatively characterized by the outage probability. This thesis focuses on the analysis and design of adaptive transmission schemes to improve the outage performance of both single- and multiple-antenna transmission over the block-fading channel, especially for the cases where discrete input constellations are used. Firstly, a new lower bound on the outage probability of non-adaptive transmission is proposed, providing an efficient tool for evaluating the performance of non-adaptive transmission. The lower bound, together with its asymptotic analysis, is essential for efficiently designing the adaptive transmission schemes considered in the thesis. Secondly, new power allocation rules are derived to minimize the outage probability of fixed-rate transmission over block-fading channels. Asymptotic outage analysis for the resulting schemes is performed, revealing important system design criteria. Furthermore, the thesis proposes novel suboptimal power allocation rules, which enjoy low-complexity while suffering minimal losses as compared to the optimal solution. Thus, these schemes facilitate power adaptation in low-cost devices. Thirdly, the thesis considers incremental-redundancy automatic-repeat-request (INR-ARQ) strategies, which perform adaptive transmission based on receiver feedback. In particular, the thesis concentrates on multi-bit feedback, which has been shown to yield significant gains in performance compared to conventional single-bit ARQ schemes. The thesis proposes a new information-theoretic framework for multi-bit feedback INR-ARQ, whereby the receiver feeds back a quantized version of the accumulated mutual information. Within this framework, the thesis presents an asymptotic analysis which yields the large gains in outage performance offered by multi-bit feedback. Furthermore, the thesis proposes practical design rules, which further illustrates the benefits of multi-bit feedback in INR-ARQ systems. In short, the thesis studies the outage performance of transmission over block-fading channels. Outage analysis is performed for non-adaptive and adaptive transmission. Improvements for the existing adaptive schemes are also proposed, leading to either lower complexity requirements or better outage performance. Still, further research is needed to bring the benefits offered by adaptive transmission into practical systems.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital communications</field><field name="subject">power allocation</field><field name="subject">automatic repeat request</field><field name="subject">multi-bit feedback</field><field name="subject">block-fading channel</field><field name="subject">outage probability</field><field name="subject">230118 Optimisation</field><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">291703 Digital Systems</field><field name="subject">291799 Communications Technologies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">SNR exponent</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/96822</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:46101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iterative receiver techniques for coded multiple access communication systems</field><field name="creator">Reed, Mark C</field><field name="description">The introduction of cellular wireless systems in the 1980s has resulted in a huge demand for personal communication services. This demand has made larger capacity systems necessary. This has been partially satisfied by the introduction of second generation digital systems. New third generation systems are now under going standardisation and will require even more efficient utilisation of the spectrum if the high bandwidth features and larger capacity are to become a reality. Motivated by these growing requirements we discuss methods of achieving large improvements in spectral efficiency and performance. Multiple-user communications over a channel can only be achieved with some form of diversity. In this work we point out that the efficient utilisation of the dimensions of space, time, and frequency will ultimately maximise the system capacity of a multiple-user system. We apply our receiver techniques solely to the base-station design where capacity limitations are currently present. We note however, that some of these techniques could also be applied at the mobile terminal receiver. We primarily focus our attention on the direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) channel, since this channel is inherently interference limited by other users in the cell of interest. We exploit a new powerful channel coding technique named " turbo coding" for its iterative decoding approach. We show how we can substitute the inner convolutional code of a turbo code encoder with the CDMA channel. By " iterative detection/decoding" or " turbo equalisation" at the receiver we achieve performance results which show the interference from other users to approach complete removal. We develop and analyse a new, low complexity, iterative interference canceller/decoder. This receiver has complexity per user linear with the memory of the channel and independent of the number of users in the system. We extend this receiver to more realistic channels that are asynchronous and include multi-path, and include spatial diversity by using an antenna array at the receiver. The CDMA channel we study exclusively uses randomly generated spreading codes. With this channel model we still achieve single user performance (no interference from other users) with a 10logL gain from L antenna elements and a gain of up to 10logP from P multi-path components. With any new receiver design, sensitivity to channel parameter errors is of paramount interest. We find that the sensitivity of our receiver is low with respect to the parameter errors induced. This is as we desire for a realisable receiver design. Finally we investigate the application of this new iterative interference canceller/decoder receiver to a number of other interference channels. These include the intersymbol interference (ISI) channel, partial response signalling (PRS), and continuous phase modulation (CPM). For these channels excellent performance improvement is generally achieved by the utilisation of the iterative interference canceller/decoder solution.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code division multiple access</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24962</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bounds and algorithms for carrier frequency and phase estimation</field><field name="creator">Rice, Feng</field><field name="description">Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is a highly bandwidth efficient transmission technique for digital communications.

The aims in this study were to determine if dentist visiting or the volume, complexity and cost of general dental care, and baseline oral HRQoL and treatment need were associated with changes in HRQoL, and/or modify the impact of dental care on changes in HRQoL. Methods The project was an observational prospective cohort study of a sample of randomly selected dentate adult Tasmanians surveyed in 2006 and followed over a one-year period. The collection procedures comprised a computer-assisted telephone interview, an oral epidemiological examination, a baseline mail self-complete questionnaire, a service use log book, and a twelve-month mail self-complete questionnaire. Change in HRQoL was measured by change in the summary measure of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14 severity) and change in the EuroQol index (EQ-5D), global oral and general transition statements, and follow-up OHIP-14 severity. Results From 1,745 eligible household numbers, 59.7% were interviewed, of whom 43.7% received epidemiological examinations. Of those, over three-quarters (77.4%) completed the baseline mail questionnaire. Nearly three-quarters of those who completed the baseline self-complete questionnaires completed the twelve-month follow-up questionnaire (73.5%). More than half of the respondents (53.8%) visited a dental practitioner, the vast majority of whom (94.9%) saw a private sector dentist. The most common types of dental care received were diagnostic, preventive and restorative services When the dependent variable was change in mean OHIP-14 severity, visiting a dentist was associated with a statistically significant worsening of oral HRQoL after adjusting for confounders. In contrast, visiting a dentist was associated with a significant improvement in quality of life when the dependent variable was the global oral health transition statement, although that association was not homogeneous. The global general health transition statement showed an unfavourable association of dental visits, although it was not statistically significant. Follow-up OHIP-14 dental attendance was associated with worsening QoL, although the association was not statistically significant. When change in HRQoL was measured by the global general health transition statement, high compared to low volume of dental care had a statistically significant favourable influence on HRQoL, although there was effect modification. With the global oral health transition statement, high complexity dental care was associated with a statistically significant worsening of HRQoL, while high cost dental care was associated with a statistically significant improvement of HRQoL. Across all measures of HRQoL, the survey participant factors most often subject to effect modification where those related to socio-economic status, particularly education and occupation. Conclusions The results varied according to which dependent measure of change in HRQoL was used. Dental care had a differing effect on general health compared to oral health, although the effects on general health varied considerably among some population groups. Researchers need to devise consistent definitions of health, HRQoL, oral health and oral HRQoL.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental health survey; Oral health; Epidemiology; Quality of life</field><field name="subject">Dentistry.</field><field name="subject">Quality of life.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulatory T cells, Th17 effector cells and cytokine microenvironment in inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease.</field><field name="creator">Eastaff-Leung, Nicola</field><field name="description">Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis) and coeliac disease are debilitating gastrointestinal diseases that seriously affect the quality of life of those affected. Under normal circumstances, the intestinal immune system is maintained in a state of controlled inflammation, whereby balance exists between protective immunity, mediated by effector cells, and tolerance mediated by cells with regulatory function. However, an aberrant immune response is believed to contribute to the intestinal inflammation present in individuals afflicted by these diseases. This thesis investigated the involvement of CD4&#8314; CD25[superscript]high Foxp3&#8314; Regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th17 Effector cells in both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and coeliac disease. The reciprocal relationship between Treg and Th17 cells under certain cytokine conditions, has prompted the exploration of these two cell types in IBD and coeliac disease. Previous studies have examined these factors individually in a range of diseases, however, to our knowledge the study of both Treg and Th17 in IBD and coeliac disease subjects represents a novel area of research. Crohn&#8217;s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and coeliac disease subjects were recruited through the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Adelaide, South Australia. In total, one-hundred and seventeen subjects were enlisted in this study to donate blood samples. In addtion, intestinal biopsy samples were collected from fifty-six subjects undergoing colonoscopy at the QEH Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. All subjects participated, with informed consent and ethics approval. Treg and Th17 cell numbers were investigated in the peripheral blood of Crohn&#8217;s disease, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease and control subjects using multi-colour, intracellular flow cytometry. A decrease in Treg cell numbers and an increase in Th17 cell numbers was observed in IBD, but not in coeliac disease. Closer investigation into the ratio of Treg and Th17 cells within patients identified a near 1:1 Treg/Th17 ratio in control subjects, but a lower Treg/Th17 ratio in IBD patients. This suggested a disturbance in regulatory and effector cell equilibrium. Furthermore, the excess of Th17 cells and deficiency of Tregs could contribute to the pathologies observed in IBD. The discovery of an imbalance in Treg and Th17 cell numbers in IBD prompted further investigation of these cells in intestinal biopsies collected from IBD, coeliac and control subjects. Real time RT-PCR of intestinal biopsy samples demonstrated increased expression of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17a, in both IBD and coeliac disease. Elevated levels of the Treg transcription factor Foxp3 were also identified in intestinal biopsies from IBD subjects. It was therefore hypothesised that Treg cells may have been actively recruited from the periphery in an attempt to control inflammation in the gut; however, the intestinal cytokine microenvironment may have restricted the regulatory function of these cells. Cytokines known to promote human Th17 differentiation, namely IL-1&#946;, IL-6, TGF-&#946;, IL-21 and IL-23, were explored in intestinal biopsy samples from IBD, coeliac and control subjects. High levels of IL-1&#946; and IL-6 were detected in IBD patient samples, however, no change in levels of IL-21 or IL-23 were observed in IBD or coeliac disease subjects. Elevated levels of TGF-&#946; were only identified in UC. No changes in cytokine expression were observed between control and coeliac subjects, except a significant decrease in IL-6 levels was identified in coeliac disease sufferers. The pro-inflammatory microenvironment identified in intestinal biopsies from IBD subjects may have promoted the continual differentiation and development of Th17 cells, whilst restricting Treg activity. Moreover, the observed deficiency of Treg in IBD patients may have impaired the ability of the immune system to limit excessive pathogenic Th17 driven immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that aim to re-establish regulatory and effector cell homeostasis by increasing Treg numbers in IBD patients, and specifically targeting Th17 cells, may prove effective in the treatment of IBD. Approaches such as these could provide greater focus to treatment strategies for IBD management compared to current broad-spectrum immunosuppressive therapies that could increase susceptibility to cancer or infection in IBD patients. In addition, the imbalance of regulatory and effector cells demonstrated in the peripheral blood of IBD patients may potentially provide new options for a noninvasive diagnostic tool.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regulatory T cells; Th17 effector cells; imflammatory bowel disease; coeliac disease</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel diseases</field><field name="subject">Crohn's disease.</field><field name="subject">Celiac disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sensitivity of returns of non-bank financial institutions to the fixed income and equity markets.</field><field name="creator">Cheong, Chee Seng</field><field name="description">Researchers have over-concentrated on the relationship between bank stock returns and interest rate changes without paying much attention to the impact of interest rates on non-bank financial institutions, in particular the insurance and real estate industries. This research attempts to examine the sensitivity and importance of interest rates and stock market price behaviour on non-bank financial institutions across three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. The results provide a different perspective on the relationship non-bank financial institutions have with the fixed income and equity markets, and sheds new light on their long-run interaction. For the insurance market, interest rate movements seem to be just as important as the stock market in explaining the variation of insurance portfolio returns in the United States. However, there is only a weak relationship between interest rate changes and insurance portfolio returns in the United Kingdom and Australia. The liquidity problem in the United Kingdom and small sample size issues in Australia may have influenced the final results. In addition, size and profitability of the insurance companies do influence the significance of interest rate coefficients. This suggests that the financial makeup of a firm can modify or influence the sensitivity of stock returns towards interest rate changes. For the securitised property market, once structural breaks are accounted for, the results show that securitised property is driven by both interest rate and stock market changes, regardless of the type of financial institutions being examined. Evidence also points to companies with different leverage ratios and companies that are tax-exempt entities are still all influenced by both the equity and fixed income markets over the long-run period, although the influence these factors have does vary across time. A major contribution of this study clearly points to the relative weightings that portfolio managers may now consider to be appropriate with regard to their holdings of bonds, equities and non-bank financial institutions in their portfolios for both their tactical and strategic asset allocations. For example, it may not be a wise decision to invest significant amounts of capital in both securitised properties and fixed income securities given that both instruments are co-integrated in the long-run. Although this research was primarily conducted prior to the current economic situation, some of the major conclusions from this research are particularly relevant today. Moreover, with better understanding of the sensitivity among security prices and various financial risk factors, financial managers are able to manage and control their companies&#8217; risk exposure towards interest rate risk and stock market conditions more effectively and efficiently.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fixed income market; Equity market; Non-bank financial institution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Local Government Act 2002: Rationalisation or reform?</field><field name="creator">Hewison, Grant James</field><field name="description">Every community is affected in some way by the decisions that local councils make. Services which communities naturally rely upon, such as clean water flowing from taps, driving or catching a bus to work, or having rubbish collected are all provided by local authorities. But the role of local government in New Zealand society goes beyond the provision of services. Democratically elected local authorities play an essential part in the overall governance and sustainable development of the country. The legal authority within which councils operate is circumscribed mainly by statute. Prior to 1999, key elements of this statutory framework had become outdated. The Local Government Act 1974, in particular, was a collection of parts enacted at different times, reflecting diverse policy approaches and objectives. It was prescriptive, complex and lengthy. Clearly, a more effective and enduring legislative framework was required. In 1999, the Labour-Alliance Government initiated a Review of the Local Government Act 1974 that aimed to achieve a new statute which reflected a coherent overall strategy for local government, moved to a more broadly empowering legislative framework, developed a partnership relationship between central and local government and clarified local government's relationship with the Treaty of Waitangi. This thesis critically examines whether these four key objectives were achieved through the enactment and subsequent implementation of the Local Government Act 2002. Was the result of the Review mere rationalisation of the 1974 Act or true reform? The thesis concludes, taking each of these objectives in turn, that the Local Government Act 2002 only partially reflects a coherent overall strategy. While a number of disjointed objectives in the 1974 Act have been rationalised, true reform that aligns the principles of local self-government in New Zealand with those accepted internationally, is a matter for future action. By contrast, the move to a more broadly empowering legislative framework balanced by greater community accountability under the 2002 Act has resulted in true reform. Although the 2002 Act has not delivered a legislative partnership relationship, it has resulted in enhanced cooperation between central and local government.

Complement depletion with cobra venom factor, PMN depletion with nitrogen mustard or anti-PMN serum and treatment with antihistamines, aprotinin and indomethacin provided no protection. The relationship between the dose of nephrotoxic antibody and the proteinuria was similar for the &#947;1 and &#947;2 subclasses and the F(ab&#8217;)2 fragment of &#947;1 antibody. However, the F(ab&#8217;) and the F(ab) antibody fragments, though fixing on the GBM did not cause proteinuria. It is Concluded that the development of proteinuria in this system: is largely independent of the C/PMN system; is due to the fixation of the F(ab&#8217;)2 fragment of the antibody molecule; and does not depend on an intact Fc piece. In the autologous phase of NTN induced by sheep antibody to GBM in DH and C4d strain gp, &lt;50% of animals developed proteinuria at the height of the autologous antibody response despite high anti-sheep immunoglobulin titres and fixation of the gp IgG and complement in the kidneys. Only 2 of 37 animals (5.4%) developed progressive disease. In a passive model of autologous phase injury using high titre rabbit antibody to sheep IgG, proteinuria failed to occur despite fixation of up to 95&#181;g of rabbit antibody per kidney. Repeated injection of sheep nephrotoxic antibody caused a persisting nephritic syndrome but not the characteristic proliferative lesion of anti-GBM diseases in other species. Because antibody responses to the alternative complement pathway activator cobra venom factor, are T-dependent and B-mice therefore do not develop resistance to its action it was possible to examine whether renal injury occured under circumstances of protracted alternative pathway activation. After periods of up to three months, no evidence from measurements of blood urea or proteinuria or from examination with light microscopy, immunofluorescent or electron microscopy was obtained to indicate a direct nephrotoxic effect of this type of complement activation. These studies do not support the concept that glomerular injury in patients with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis and hypocomplementaemia from C3 nephritic factor are due to the continued activation of the alternative pathway. The clinical course and levels of anti-GBM antibody were compared in 20 patients with Goodpasture&#8217;s syndrome treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression (8 patients), immunosuppression alone (4patients) or no specific therapy (8 patients). There was a more rapid fall in the level of anti-GBM antibody and pulmonary haemorrhage was less protracted in the patients treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. In this group, one patient who presented with severe renal failure showed a marked improvement in renal function and there was no progression of disease in the four with milder renal involvement. Two of the four patients treated with immunosuppression alone and only two of the eight patients who received no specific therapy maintained normal renal function. In the group which received no specific therapy, one of the six patients who progressed to renal failure had mild renal involvement initially. There was a significant correlation between the level of anti-GBM antibody and the severity of the morphological changes seen at renal biopsy but not between the level of anti-GBM antibody and the severity of lung haemorrhage. The course and outcome of the disease in these patients not treated or treated with immunosuppression alone was better than that described in earlier reports of this disease, while those patients with plasma exchange and immunosuppression fared even better. An adequately stratified controled trial of immunosuppression in plasma exchange versus immunsuppression alone is justified. Immune complex (IC) levels were measured in normal subjects using the C1q solid phase, C1q deviation, C1q binding and polyethylene glycol precipitation assays. Significant changes in IC levels were seen in normals with each of the assays but the pattern of variation was not consistent between assays or subjects or in the same subject from day to day. There were no consistent changes with meals, time of day, exercise or the prior administration of prednisone. Low levels of IC appeared to be normal in plasma, but the variation in IC levels was not explained. Normal IC may well comprise mixtures of non-specific immunoglobulin aggregates, rheumatoid factor-immunoglobulin complexes, idiotype anti-idiotype complexes as well as specific antibody complexes with antigens from food, infective agents and other sources. Eighty-six patients with primary glomerulonephritis had circulating IC levels measured in 4 IC assays at the time of percutaneous renal biopsy. Patients with acute glomerulonephritis and type 1 mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis showed the greatest positivity rate overall while patients with membranous glomerulonephritis had the lowest rate. overall, just over half the patients with primary glomerulonephritis were positive in any one assay and &lt;5% in any three assays. Repeat samples taken from the same patients after an interval of some months often showed the same pattern of reactivity in the 4 assays or a return towards lower values. Thirty-one patients with proven acute myocardial infarction (MI) were studied prospectively at the time of admission to hospital and at 3, 7, and 18 days using 4 IC assays. Each assay showed an increased incidence of IC activity in MI with 76% of patients being Positive in at least one assay on one or more of the sampling days. A positive IC assay did not show a significant correlation with cardiac failure, pericarditis, post MI syndrome or previous infarction. The presence of IC was found to correlate with serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum enzymes and ESR and suggested that complexed CRP or other acute phase proteins may account for some of the IC activity found with less specific assays. The measurement of IC levels in MI has not proved helpful in the diagnosis, management or prediction of outcome in this disorder. In recipients of cadaveric renal transplants circulating IC as detected by the C1q deviation test were found in more than two thirds of patients with recent graft. IC levels were found to rise after rejection episodes and also after episodes of infection. Low or rapidly falling IC levels soon after transplantation were associated with good graft function. Sera from 4 patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) were shown to contain abnormal lipoproteins which behaved as IC. One IC lipoprotein (ICVLDL) had the density in ultracentrifugation of very low density lipoprotein, but a markedly altered electrophoretic mobility. A second IC lipoprotein (ICIDL) had the electrophoretic mobility of very low density lipoprotein but was slightly denser than low density lipoprotein on ultracentrifugation. Both the ICVLDL and ICLDL contained IgG and behaved as IC in the C1q deviation test, platelet aggregation and rheumatoid factor inhibition assays, but not in the conglutinin and C1q binding assays and the C1q solid phase assays. These differences could be due to the low densities of the ICVLDL and ICLDL. The abnormal lipoprotein IC disappeared with clinical remission in two patients and were not present in the sera of other patients with inactive or mild SLE, type 4 hyperlipidaemia or during prednisone therapy or plasma exchange for other conditions. These IC appeared to be markers of severe and active SLE.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational biology of bird song evolution</field><field name="creator">Ranjard, Louis</field><field name="description">Individuals of a given population share more behavioural traits with each other than with members of other populations. For example, in humans, traditions are specific to regions or countries. These cultural relationships can tell us about the history of the populations, their origin and the amount of exchange between them. In birds, regional dialects have been described in many species. However, the mechanisms with which dialects form in populations is not fully understood because it is difficult to analyse experimentally. Translocated populations, with their known histories, offer an opportunity to study these mechanisms. From the study of bird vocalisations we can make inferences regarding population structure and relationships as well as their history, individual behavioural state, neuronal and physiological mechanisms or development of neuronal learning. Too achieve this, cross-disciplinary approaches are necessary, combining field work, bioacoustic methods, statistical tools such as machine learning, ecological knowledge and phylogenetic methods. Here, I will describe computational methods for the treatment and classification of bird vocalisations and will use them to depict the relationships between bird populations. First, I discretise the data in order to define the cultural traits. Then phylogenetic tree-building methods are used. Two approaches are possible, first to map these traits onto known phylogenies and, second, to directly build the phylogeny of these traits. I describe the application of these methods to test several hypothesis on bird songs evolution related to both their history and the mechanisms with which they evolve. Evidence for the presence of dialects in the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis) is provided on the basis of the syllable content of the songs. The absence of vocal sexual dimorphism is reported in the Australasian gannet (or takapu, Morus serrator), a member of the Sulidae family for which extensive sexual dimorphism has been reported in other species. Subsequently, convergence between the begging calls of several cuckoo species and their respective hosts is suggested by various bioacoustic methods. In addition, the male calls of the hihi (or stitchbird, Notiomystis cincta) is analysed in an island population. The corresponding pattern of variation suggests a post-dispersal acquisition of calls via learning which is in agreement with the most related species in the revised phylogeny of the hihi. Finally, the mechanisms of song evolution are depicted in translocated populations of tieke (or saddleback, Philesturnus carunculatus rufusater), resulting in the development of island dialects.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">computational biology</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">cultural evolution</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">bioacoustics</field><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">bird song</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Childhood bronchiectasis: national incidence, disease progression and an evaluation of inhaled antibiotic therapy</field><field name="creator">Twiss, Jacob</field><field name="description">Background: Bronchiectasis is a chronic suppurative lung disease, defined by dilatation of bronchial airways, resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. It continues to affect large numbers of people worldwide, particularly indigenous or disadvantaged communities. The goals of this thesis were to determine childhood bronchiectasis occurrence in New Zealand, define its progression, and evaluate a potential new therapy; inhaled antibiotics. Methods: Firstly, a single-centre retrospective study described the prevalence, aetiology and severity of childhood bronchiectasis in Auckland. Secondly, a two year prospective multi-centre study described the incidence, aetiology and severity of new cases of bronchiectasis in New Zealand. Thirdly, disease progression was estimated through retrospective linear mixed-model analyses of pulmonary function and compared to peers with cystic fibrosis. Fourthly, an evaluation of inhaled gentamicin pharmacokinetics was made through a single-dose open-label study. Finally, a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled two-period community-based crossover trial of inhaled antibiotics was conducted. Results: Children identified had severe, extensive bronchiectasis with an Auckland prevalence of 1:3000 and a national incidence of 3.7:100,000 per year. Compared with New Zealand children of European ethnicity, the incidence was 12 times higher in Pasifika and 3 times higher in Maori. Pneumonia, poverty, immunodeficiency, aspiration and recent immunosuppressive therapy were the most important aetiologies. Children with bronchiectasis had more severe obstructive lung disease than peers with cystic fibrosis (FEV1 intercept at ten years age 63% versus 77% predicted, p&lt;0.001) but declined more slowly (-0.9% versus -2.5% predicted per annum, p=0.02). Inhaled gentamicin (80mg) safely achieved target concentrations within sputum (mean 697 &#956;g/g). Despite low adherence, inhaled gentamicin was well tolerated, resulted in reduced symptoms, decreased Haemophilus influenzae density (-2.7 log10 cfu/ml, p&lt;0.001), decreased airway inflammation (neutrophils, IL-1&#946;, IL-8, TNF&#945;) and reduced oral antibiotic use (OR 0.19, p&lt;0.001). No significant change in spirometry or hospitalisation rates occurred over the three months. Conclusion: Childhood bronchiectasis has a high and increasing prevalence in New Zealand, especially in Pasifika and Maori. Children have extensive, progressive disease despite &#8216;standard&#8217; management. Inhaled gentamicin is well tolerated, achieves effective concentrations, improves symptoms, reduces bacterial load and airway inflammation aswell as oral antibiotic use. However, low adherence suggests poor acceptability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sedimentological and geochemical approach to understanding cycles of stratovolcano growth and collapse at Mt Taranaki, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zernack, Anke Verena</field><field name="description">The long-term behaviour of andesitic stratovolcanoes is characterised by a repetition of edifice growth and collapse phases. This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the conservation of New Zealand's threatened biodiversity : management, species recovery and legislation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Ecology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Seabrook-Davison, Mark Nicholas Hawdon</field><field name="description">Content removed from thesis due to copyright restrictions: Seabrook-Davison, M.

The aim was to gain insight into the Auslan-English language contact outcomes that might be found in these settings, and what factors influenced these outcomes. The results indicated that the most unique use of language by deaf bilinguals was that of simultaneous use of both spoken English and Auslan, and it was this simultaneous use which facilitated the two examples of code-switching (defined as a complete change of language from Auslan to spoken English) that was found in the data. The other two contact outcomes of significance were frequent transference of English into Auslan, and the equally frequent use of fingerspelling, which has a pivotal role in filling the gap in Auslan, a language with no orthographic form. The study also revealed that Auslan (a signed language) was the language in which many issues of identity were expressed by deaf bilinguals, regardless of whether the individual was a first or second language learner of Auslan. The results confirmed that these language and identity factors did influence the language contact outcomes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auslan bilingualism, sign language/spoken language, sign/spoken language and code-switching, sign/spoken language bilingualism, deaf adult bilinguals</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Same-sex attracted women and their relationship with GPs: identity, risk and disclosure</field><field name="creator">McNair, Ruth Patricia</field><field name="description">Patient-doctor relationships between same-sex attracted women and general practitioners (GPs) have been presented as problematic in the literature.

The second aim was to identify the contribution of women&#8217;s satisfaction with employment arrangements to their psychological well-being. Participants were 165 employed pregnant women over 18 years of age and with sufficient English for completion of study materials, systematically recruited in the third trimester of pregnancy. Data were collected in pregnancy and at 3 and 10 months postpartum. Maternal preferences, not or no longer breastfeeding and lower maternal separation anxiety were associated with significantly increased likelihood of resuming postpartum employment when maternal age, educational attainment and occupational status were controlled for.  A constellation of adverse employment conditions made independent contributions to measurably worse maternal mood including experiencing sexual discrimination in pregnancy, no maternity entitlements when known determinants of poorer maternal well-being were controlled in regression analyses. These findings provide evidence about the relevance of structural determinants to maternal well-being, and highlight the urgency of a national paid parental leave scheme in Australia.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">maternal employment, postpartum, mental health, maternity leave</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the use of mediation in environmental dispute resolution under s.268 of the Resource Management Act 1991</field><field name="creator">Borrie, N. C.</field><field name="description">Since the 1970s there has been a growing interest in, and utilisation of, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) techniques to resolve environmental conflicts in western societies. ADR was incorporated into one of New Zealand's main environmental statutes, the Resource Management Act 1991(RMA). Under s.268 of the RMA the Environment Court (the Court) may, if the parties agree, conduct mediation in order to facilitate settlement of resource management disputes.  The RMA, which has now been in operation for ten years, gives no guidance as to the way in which mediation is to be conducted. The Court has developed procedures and processes for administering and conducting mediation. This study critically evaluates the practice of Court assisted mediation of environmental disputes under the RMA. A literature review and interviews with stakeholder groups are used in this evaluation. The study shows that mediation generates benefits for the Court and participants. It also identifies limitations with the current mediation procedures and processes. These may impact the effectiveness of participants in mediation, their satisfaction with, and support for, the mediated settlement and with the environmental outcomes.  The study recommends a series of guidelines be prepared on the functions and administrative procedures of the Court and on the mediation process promoted by the Court. Further research is also recommended. It is considered that these recommendations, if implemented, will enhance the process for participants, ensure more equitable and consistent environmental outcomes, in terms of present and future generations, and retain public confidence in the mediation process.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental disputes</field><field name="subject">Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</field><field name="subject">environmental mediation</field><field name="subject">Resource Management Act 1991</field><field name="subject">s.268</field><field name="subject">court assisted mediation</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">prerequisites</field><field name="subject">stakeholders</field><field name="subject">benefits</field><field name="subject">limitations</field><field name="subject">good practice guidelines</field><field name="subject">dispute resolution</field><field name="subject">180123 - Litigation, Adjudication and Dispute Resolution</field><field name="subject">050205 - Environmental Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of public policy in linking university and research centres with industry in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Amaradasa, R. M.W.</field><field name="description">The promotional mechanisms employed in University-Research-Industry (URI) relationships have been considered a strategic factor in the development objectives of the industrialized countries. Such promotional mechanisms are based on recognized conceptual frameworks, which have been carefully examined by researchers. However, little work has been done in this field with respect to problems of less industrialized countries especially in small developing countries. The objective of this study was therefore to compare the URI characteristics and promotional mechanisms of developed countries with those in operation in small developing countries like Sri Lanka.The methodology employed for this study included exploratory survey, follow-up interviews, interviews with decision-makers and case studies while analytical tools in the grounded theory approach were used to deal with qualitative data.The URI relationships which are used as instruments to generate economic benefits, show wide discrepancies in performance among different countries. The promotional mechanisms, widely prevalent in industrialized countries, emphasized the importance of framework conditions. The characteristic features of the URI relationships in developed countries are better described in the international literature in terms of models, concepts and systems such as National System of Innovation. An analysis of literature shows that less industrialized countries need to have a better understanding of issues related to the operation of those relationships that are less rigorously influenced by theories and concepts developed in industrialized countries.The study revealed that the relationships in Sri Lanka are based on the lower end of the spectrum, characterized by short-term orientation that include education and training, and service-based relationships. Lack of structural mechanisms, financial constraints, regulatory rigidity, inadequacy of laboratory facilities and absence of inter-organizational communication seems to be the major features that curtail relationships. It was observed that process related constraints and weaknesses are widespread in all three types of organizations, in addition to the weaknesses related to the framework. Accordingly, three sets of issues based on internal and external factors for a particular type of organization were developed which could be widely used as check list of issues for any developing country. This checklist was tested with new forms of organizations which have evolved to overcome such weaknesses, by adopting the responsive-adaptive approach. The new forms of organizations show features such as heterogeneity, organizational diversity and trans-disciplinarity as well as internal transformation, influence of one type of organization upon another, creation of new organizations and networks. These features are more prevalent in organizations in developed countries. The findings lead to conclusion that the URI relationships in developing countries show in a broad context similarities to those of developed countries but at the same time differ in nature. The concepts and models used in developed countries to explain the URI relationships can also be used to explain those in developing countries. The importance in understanding micro level conditions and taking remedial measures to overcome negative impact is imperative. Finally, the public policy interventions that are necessary to promote URI relationships, while eliminating weaknesses in the framework and micro-environment are proposed in this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial deregulation, banking development, and the likelihood of banking fragility: the case of Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Astiyah, Siti</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to examine the relationship between interest rates, saving through the banking sector, credit from banks, and private investment using the financial deregulation hypothesis and the determinants of the probability of banking fragility for the Indonesian case. Some of the financial deregulation hypothesis related to those variables and the determinants of the likelihood of banking fragility has been tested using cross country data, but only a few studies have been performed using country specific data and there is no study for the particulars of the Indonesian case. Therefore, this study is intended to fill those gaps and add to the literature on the links between financial deregulation, banking intermediation, and banking fragility in the Indonesian economy. Moreover, this study will add the additional credit fiinctions associated with state banks and national private banks and add additional variables to the credit fiinction to consider specific issues associated with the Indonesian financial sector such as borrowing from Bank Indonesia. In addition, this study covers the 1997 financial and banking crises period, therefore this study will use a unit root test to consider the possibility of the presence of a structural break associated with the 1997 financial and banking crises for variables most relevant to the monetary and banking sectors in Indonesia.To investigate the relationship between interest rates, saving through the banking sector, credit from banks and private investinent using the financial deregulation hypothesis, it is hypothesised that real interest rates will encourage saving through the banking sector. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that credit from banks plays important role as a channel between saving through the banking sector and private investinent. It implies that financial deregulation contributed to increasing private investment through the availability of credit from banks and in turn it contributed to increasing economic growth. This hypothesis is in line with Shaw's views on debt intermediation. However, private investment is also hypothesised to be related to net capital flows of the private sector which essentially were foreign borrowings. Therefore, it suggests that private investment is not only financed by domestic banks but also by foreign borrowing. If most of the foreign borrowing is unhedged, a sudden large depreciation of the domestic currency will reduce the net worth of the borrower, which in tiim, will contribute to increasing banking problems. The problem in the banking sector, however, is often associated with other factors. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the probability of banking fragility is influenced by three groups of variables namely financial deregulation variables, macroeconomic variables, and group bank specific variables.This thesis found that positive real interest rates significantly affect real saving through the banking sector and that real saving after being reduced by the minimum reserve requirement is positive and significantly affects real credit from the banking sector in the long run. Real credit from the banking sector is also positively affected by borrowing from Bank Indonesia. Moreover, real credit from the banking sector positively and significantly affects real private investment and real private investment is also positive and significantly related to net capital flows of the private sector in the long run. This finding supports the evidence that real private investment was associated with credit from the banking sector and net capital flows of the private sector. By examining the impact of real interest rates on real saving through the banking sector, real saving through the banking sector adjusted for minimum reserves on real credit from the banking sector, and real credit from the banking sector on real private investment, there is evidence that an increase in real interest rates accompanied by a credible financial policy is associated with an increase in real private investment through the credit availability effect at least up to the second quarter of 1997. This finding is consistent with Shaw's views on debt intermediation, which are that an increase in banking intermediation contributes to increased private investment. An increase in banking intermediation which is indicated by increased credit to the private sector, however, is also often associated with an increased probability of banking fragility.This thesis found that the probability of banking fragility in Indonesia is significanfly related to financial deregulation variables and group bank specific variables for both the sample periods 1986:3-1997:2 and 1986:3 1999:2. On the other hand, macroeconomic variables are not significant in influencing the probability of banking fragility for the sample period 1986:3-1997:2, but are significanfly related to the probability of banking fragility for the sample period 1986:3-1999:2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Driving performance on an expressway under fog conditions and its improvement use of a fog warning system</field><field name="creator">Brisbane, Graham James</field><field name="description">Problem Drivmg in any situation where the available sight distance is less than that appropriate for the travel speed of the vehicle will naturally present a problem when a hazard occurs. A motorist is often forced to take some emergency action to avoid a potential accident.In most situations on the road there are many visual cues to give motorists an indication of an appropriate travel speed as well as conferring a perception of the speed actually being travelled. These may take the form of longitudinal lines on the road, warning signs or the general roadside landscaping.However, in fog these cues cease to be visible and motorists commonly drive at speeds well in excess of the available stopping distance, frequently unaware they are doing so having lost the cues that help create the perception of speed. This problem is obviously accentuated on higher speed roads such as divided carriageways where the only cues are to tell drivers they are on a high speed road and no apparent threats are available to prompt a lowering of speed.To address this there have been many attempts to provide Driver Aid Systems to warn motorists of the hazards they face. One such system was provided on the Waterfall - Bulli section of the F6 in 1974. However the continued occurrences of multiple vehicle accidents culminating in a 66 vehicle event in 1986 suggested that the system may no longer be as effective as was originally intended. (No research was ever undertaken to assess whether the system actually met its objectives although this was unlikely, given the nature of the fog in the Bulli Tops area, the way the system operated and the fact a number of features of the original proposal were never actually installed).Proposed Solution Rather than simply replace a system which was no longer maintainable or visible in bad fog conditions with a similar system, a research project was proposed to examine changes in technology which had become available since the 70s and to determine whether these could be used to develop a workable system.The new solution proposed a dynamic, site independent system which could monitor both the fog and the motorists and provide real-time advice to the motorist if vehicle speed was inappropriate to the conditions.Research Before developing a new system based purely on the theory, a trial site was selected and research undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the arrangement outlined.Over a three year period studies were undertaken on the characteristics of vehicles when travelling in various fog visibilities ranging from 250 m to under 50 m.The research was undertaken in three discrete stages; April - December, 1992, - characteristics of vehicles unaffected by any sign display January - April, 1993, - evaluation of the 1974 sign system modified to provide some limited dynamic information May, 1993 - December, 1994, - evaluation of an improved sign arrangement with full dynamic information provided on fog and speed where appropriate.The results showed that an independent dynamic sign display could be used which would be effective in modifying vehicle speed characteristics, particularly at times when the speeds were highest without the use of such a sign.Outcome As a result of the results of this research project, the RTA proceeded with the design and construction of a new Driver Aid System for the F6 Waterfall-Bulli Freeway. The work involved a $3.5m contract with Telstra and was commissioned in 1996. A number a factors in the design were directly attributable to the findings of the research including:&#8226; the use of dynamic independent sites &#8226; incorporation into each site of fog detection equipment, speed detection and warning signs capable of displaying appropriate warning messages for individual motorists relative to the situation &#8226; location of the appropriate areas for the system to be located &#8226; use of flashing warning lights in association with each sign displayPapers Published The following papers on this research have been published at various major Conferences:BRISBANE G.J.B.

Nature and accountability are 'foundational' concepts upon which environmental accounting has been built and in this work I show how these can be, and are, contested. If environmental accounting is to comment seriously on environmental concerns, these theoretical underpinnings must be explicitly (re)explored. This requires us to have a more comprehensive understanding of both what the project is about (nature) and what it is trying to achieve (environmental accountability and ultimately abating the ongoing destruction of the environment). In light of this, notions of nature and accountability are extensively re-examined to expose their multiplicity and to open up the assumptions that have surrounded these representational categories. This stages a return to these 'core' concepts to show how they are, and can be re-negotiated in order to develop less exploitative relationships with the non-human world.This thesis considers these concepts and contextualises its developments in relation to global negotiations over the issue of climate change. Discourses of climate change are explored, as is the Kyoto Protocol and Australian responses to global warming.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial characteristics of interest-free banks and conventional banks</field><field name="creator">Al-Sultan, Waleed</field><field name="description">Many countries all over the world currently experience what became known as "Dual Banking" where interest-fi-ee Islamic banks operate side by side with conventional banks. Islamic banks conduct normal business as any conventional bank but do not pay or receive interest. They operate on profit/loss sharing principle. By this, is meant both the supplier of the flinds and the borrower share the risks; both prosper when returns are favorable and suffer together when returns are poor.The literature on Islamic banking and finance though recent is growing fast. Western scholars have begun to show an interest and make substantial contributions. The interdisciplinary nature of the literature offers a challenge.However, there are still numerous questions to be answered, many problems to be solved and a number of challenges to be faced. In particular, empirical work is needed to assess the differences in financial characteristics of interest-free and conventional banks. Also, nothing much has been written about the loan market in a dual banking system. Moreover, very little is known about the attitudes of clients towards Islamic vis-a-vis traditional banks. Furthermore, research on the performance of Islamic banks in individual countries has not received much attention.This thesis is an interdisciplinary study which attempts to make a (very) modest contribution towards filling the gap in the literature. In particular, this study tests for structural differences between the financial characteristics of Islamic and traditional banks. This testing is done through the use of discriminant analysis apphed to a sample of 48 Middle Eastern banks, 12 of which are interest-fi-ee banks. The analysis covers 20 financial ratios which evaluate liquidity, leverage, performance, credit risk, probability and efficiency.This study also tries to model the decision, of a chent facing a dual banking system, to deal with a traditional or an Islamic bank. This is done using logit and probit regression analysis.A simuhaneous equations model is developed and tested using time series data for 18 conventional banks and 12 Islamic banks to examine the performance of the commercial loan market within a dual-banking system.Moreover, this thesis tries to test if the transactions of Islamic banks are really free of all traces of "usury interest". A case study of the Kuwait Finance House is conducted. This involves in-depth analysis of the activities, products and financial statements of this company.The clients' perceptions of Islamic banking are also examined. This is done through the application of factor analysis to survey resuHs collected by the researcher on Kuwaitis' attitudes to Kuwait Finance House, the oldest and largest financial institution operating in Kuwait.The analysis of the evolution of Islamic banks suggest that these banks use the same tools and procedures as traditional (i.e. interest-based) banks in those areas where there is no conflict between banking operations and Islamic principles. Islamic banks have devised (and are still devising) new instruments to enable them to achieve their objectives in accordance with Islamic Laws.The simultaneous equations regression analysis suggests that the price of loans charged by Islamic banks does not exert any significant influence on the demand for commercial loans of the customers of conventional banks. However, the demand for funds offered by Islamic banks is positively cortelated with the rates of interest charged by conventional banks operating within the dual banking system.The logit and probit regression results suggest that the more people adhere to Islamic teachings, the higher the proportion of clients which deals with Islamic banks. The results also suggest that, age, income and occupation, are important factors in deciding which banking system to choose.An analysis of those activities and tools of finance of Kuwait Finance House (KFH), the only Islamic Bank curtently operating in Kuwait, suggests that this company is not a mere bank. It acts as a financier, contractor, lessor, developer and agent.The consumers' survey suggests that 49.3 percent of the respondents bortowed funds from KFH at some time during the last five years, but only 34.5% of the respondents held some type of deposit account with KFH during the time of the survey. The survey also suggests that 51.7 per cent of the respondents prefer to deal with traditional banks rather than KFH.Application of principal component analysis to survey results suggests that variables which motivate customers to deal with KFH rather than traditional banks can be condensed into five factors, namely: religion, traditional services, terms of bortowing. community development and convenience religion. Those respondents who prefer to deal with traditional banks rather than KFH expressed doubts about the interest-free nature of transactions of KFH; fear that their deposits with KFH may not be guaranteed by the Kuwaiti Central Bank, dissatisfaction with curtent restrictions of the application of the profit/loss sharing principle, particularly in the area of personal loans, belief that the transactions of the two type of banks are very similar and feeling each type of bank provide same traditional services.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial liberalization and economy crisis: macromodelling the Thai economy</field><field name="creator">Auepiyachut, Wilai</field><field name="description">The introductory part of this thesis identifies developments in world financial markets, and then focuses upon the financial crisis that afflicted East Asia and Thailand in particular. The crisis in Thailand that began in mid 1997 occurred due to a loss of intemational and domestic confidence in the Thai economy arising from the weakness of its financial sector. This in tum is attributed to madequate pmdential regulation that resulted in an excessive stock market boom and a real estate bubble, in which foreign loans were used to finance non-productive investment in land and properties.A dynamic macroeconomic model for the Thai economy was constmcted by emphasizing the impact aspect of the Thai crisis: namely the impact of a jump in the perceived financial risk in investing in the Thai economy; the impact of an increase of short-term flows in financing non-productive investments; and the impact of a collapse in aggregate supply resulting from financial and corporate sector insolvencies. In addition, government policy advocated by the IMF in response to the Thai financial crisis in the initial stage is explicitly analyzed and compared with the Radelet and Sachs (RS) policy approach.The major conclusion from the simulation results presented is that an exogenous shock arising from a temporary increase in the perceived risk of Thai financial assets during the onset of the crisis period, in conjunction with the collapse in aggregate supply as a result of financial and corporate sector insolvencies, can lead to a Severe temporary economic contraction both in domestic demand and supply.Implementing the IMF approach, by tightening monetary and fiscal policies in the initial stage of the crisis, could strengthen the real exchange rate in the short mn but at a potentially high cost. Such a policy contraction contributes to a more protracted decline in aggregate supply and private capital stock, the latter being detrimental for long-term economic growth and aggregate demand. The IMF approach produces more favorable effects in terms of external developments (more stabilized exchange rate), while the RS approach brings about favourable effects upon domestic demand and supply. The simulation results suggest that adopting the RS approach is an appropriate policy option in the short-term, particularly in dealing with such a crisis in the early stage. The RS policy approach eases the crisis in its initial stages arising from the abmpt and severe contraction in domestic demand and supply, but it comes at the cost of the larger depreciation of the real exchange rate than that for the IMF approach. Restmcturing of the financial sector is important but needs a more comprehensive and well-thought-out financial restmcturing plan, otherwise it may lead to a more protracted contraction in economic activities. Encouraging long-term flows is also essential because they can generate a larger accumulation of private capital stock and a higher level of aggregate supply relative to short-term flows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the responses of the Pacific Island States to the fisheries provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention</field><field name="creator">Aqorau, Transform</field><field name="description">The thesis shows that there are three phases to the responses of the Pacific Island States to tuna management obligations in the LOSC. The first phase, from 1979 to 1989 involved strengthening the organisation of the Pacific Island States to co-ordinate their relationship. The second phase, from 1990 to 1996, was characterised by efforts to improve the regulation of foreign fishing vessels' activities in the region. The third phase, from 1997 onwards will involve reviewing the present tuna management and conservation arrangements to reflect principles of responsible tuna management and conservation. The review should take into account the new international instruments developed by the international community.The overall conclusion the thesis draws are as follows:&#8226; That the LOSC gives coastal States the authority to manage and conserve tuna in their EEZ. This authority carries with it the responsibility to ensure that tuna resources are not over-exploited. The obligation to conserve and manage may be implemented individually or it may be exercised co-operatively between the coastal States and also between the coastal States and DWFNs;That the responses of the Pacific Island States in general to the tuna provisions of the LOSC have complied with the LOSC imperatives for the management and conservation of tuna. However, the responses do not go far enough to discharge all the fisheries obligations of the LOSC; and;&#8226; That the challenge for future tuna management arrangements is to ensure that co-operative arrangements are made with DWFNs to ensure that tuna is managed throughout its entire range and that conservation obligations are clearly reflected in the responses of the Pacific islands to the challenges arising from the EEZ regime.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout.

The method is named the Quantum-inspired Spiking Neural Network (QiSNN) framework. QiSNN represents an integrated wrapper approach. An evolutionary process evolves appropriate feature subsets for a given classification task and simultaneously optimises the neural and learning-related parameters of the network. Unlike other methods, the connection weights of this network are determined by a fast one-pass learning algorithm which dramatically reduces the training time. In its core, QiSNN employs the Thorpe neural model that allows the efficient simulation of even large networks. In QiSNN, the presence or absence of features is represented by a string of concatenated bits, while the parameters of the neural network are continuous. For the exploration of these two entirely different search spaces, a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is developed. The method maintains a population of probabilistic models specialised for the optimisation of either binary, continuous or heterogeneous search spaces while utilising a small and intuitive set of parameters. The EDA extends the Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) proposed by Han and Kim (2002) and was named the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Model EDA (hHM-EDA). The algorithm is compared to numerous contemporary optimisation methods and studied in terms of convergence speed, solution quality and robustness in noisy search spaces. The thesis investigates the functioning and the characteristics of QiSNN using both synthetic feature selection benchmarks and a real-world case study on ecological modelling. By evolving suitable feature subsets, QiSNN significantly enhances the classification accuracy of eSNN. Compared to numerous other feature selection techniques, like the wrapper-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC), QiSNN demonstrates a competitive classification and feature selection performance while requiring comparatively low computational costs.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolving connectionist system</field><field name="subject">Spiking neural network</field><field name="subject">Quantum-inspired</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">Estimation of distribution algorithm</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double Star</field><field name="creator">Thornton, Bernard Christopher Buchanan</field><field name="description">The work is situated in a literary and theoretical context by working with the concepts of authenticity and realism, and within that the story/world distinction.

One of the biggest problems during this solidification process occurs when the molten metal naturally shrinks away from the mould as it solidifies. This makes it increasingly difficult to efficiently and effectively cool targeted areas in the casting through conduction, since the direct contact between the solidifying casting and the cooling block is significantly reduced or even lost. A typical cooling block (termed in this thesis as a &#8220;chill&#8221;) is a cooling circuit that is embedded in a permanent mold (or die) and positioned to enable high heat transfer (effective cooling) to a targeted large section in the casting. If a large volume section in a casting does not cool efficiently and in the correct sequence in the overall product (i.e. solidification first in the furthest part from the sprue inlet followed by successive and ordered solidification towards the sprue inlet, until finally the sprue inlet itself), then it will create a &#8220;hot spot&#8221; which will create macro-shrinkage in the casting. This can create millions of dollars of waste in terms of casting rejects, lost productivity, and reworks for a given manufacturing company. When the molten metal solidifies, it shrinks by about 6.6 % for aluminium alloys and 4.0 % for magnesium alloys. This creates an air gap at the casting and mold interface. This air gap causes inefficient, random and isolated pockets of heat transfer from the casting to a contacting chill, which in turn causes a significant variation in the temperature distribution in the casting and die during solidification. A die operating in an incorrect and unstable temperature band will very likely produce adverse secondary effects in the final product such as macro shrinkage, micro shrinkage, hot tearing, gas porosity, or even misruns. This aim of this study is to theoretically understand and experimentally develop a cooling technique that can offset or close up the growing air gap and maintain high heat transfer between the casting and contacting chill, by ensuring that the chill is pushed closer into the casting at specific times during the solidification (and shrinking) process. A movable copper chill was designed and built to push forward into an insulated mold. The experiments were carried out using commercially available A356 aluminium alloy. The chill was pushed into the casting as it solidified in the mold. Studies were carried out to understand the effect of a movable chill with different cooling conditions compared to a fixed chill. Numerical simulations were conducted using developed boundary conditions in a commercial casting solidification package(ProCASTTM). The boundary condition used to emulate the air gap is a temporally distributed interfacial heat transfer coefficient function between the casting and chill and this is manually calculated using inverse modelling in an in-house developed optimisation package (OPTCASTTM) to compare and validate with experimental data. The resulting sensitivities of the casting due to different chill conditions (i.e. fixed vs. moving) are described through physical phenomenon, metallographic analysis and computational modelling. Results show that the effective cooling can be increased by 39.2 % by using movable chill with cooling compared to fixed chill with cooling. The percentage of complete contact between the casting and chill has been increased from 10 % in case of fixed chill with cooling to 76% in case of movable chill with cooling. Apart from effectiveness of cooling, the quality of casting produced with new cooling technique has significantly improved. The secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of the casting produced under the movable chill have be reduced by 26 % compared to fixed chill.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solidification control</field><field name="subject">Casting chills</field><field name="subject">Casting cooling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of preheating condition on strength of AA6060 Aluminium Alloy for extrusion</field><field name="creator">Meng, Cheng</field><field name="description">Fletcher Aluminium is a New Zealand company that manufactures aluminium extrusions for the building market. Their extrusion process involves using a hydraulic ram to force heated raw supplied material, in the form of large diameter cylindrical logs, through a die land that is the desired product shape. The final quality of the extruded product is influenced by the extrusion temperature, ram pressure and extrusion speed. The speed of extrusion at Fletcher Aluminium is limited by the extrusion ram pressure because the extrusion machine is operating at the pressure limit of the compressor. Currently the company requires an increase in the extrusion speed, while maintaining quality requirements where these improvements are desired without upgrading the compressor. The press pressure is required to overcome friction and the flow stress of the billet, which is dependent on the precipitates and solutes conditions and their strengthening effects in the billet. However, the preheating temperature and extrusion speeds need to be sufficiently low enough to avoid hot tearing. This research starts to increase the ram speed by decreasing the Mg2Si content for precipitation strengthening. Heat treatment may be used to dissolve Mg2Si content by billet preheat to a temperature at or exceeds solvus temperature (TSolvus). However, a higher (than TSolvus) billet temperature may have two conflicting effects. First, a higher temperature in general reduces the flow stress thus lowering the required pressure. On the other hand, at temperature higher than Tsolvus, Mg2Si should completely dissolve, resulting in solid solution strengthening thus increasing the flow stress. The objective of the study is to quantify the strengthening contributions from solute atoms (Mg / Si) and precipitates (Mg2Si) on the as-received and heat treated test samples using room temperature mechanical testing and phase diagram analysis. The selected heat treatment conditions fully enclose the preheating temperature and time range currently used in Fletcher Aluminium production. Simulations of the extrusion were conducted by hot compression testing (Gleeble test), to measure the combination of strengthening effects during deformation at elevated temperatures. The room temperature tests have shown that hardness, yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are minimised at approximately 405&#176;C. The minimum point is shown to be caused by the combination of strengthening and softening due to solid solution and precipitation strengthening. The higher values of hardness, YS and UTS at lower and higher preheating temperatures are mainly due to precipitation and solution strengthening respectively. The findings show that, the solution of Mg2Si gradually increases as the temperature increases at temperatures exceeding 405&#176;C. Hardness, YS and UTS were compared in order to determine the correlation between each mechanical property. A correlation exists, but it is not simple to translate between each mechanical property. The relationship between hardness and stress observed for 8% permanent strain was also investigated; there was no improvement in correlation. The elevated temperature tests show that initial flow stress and peak flow stress reduces linearly with temperature increases, which means higher testing temperature results lower precipitation and solid solution strengthening effects. Additionally, the constants of the Gleeble &#8211; Holomon equation were numerically calculated and are similar to published values. The Gleeble &#8211; Holomon equation was combined with Felthams equation in order to provide a relationship between extrusion velocity and extrusion temperature.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium extrusion</field><field name="subject">AA6060</field><field name="subject">Aluminium extrusion pre-heating</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prediction of educational outcomes in the adult learner, using the Theory of Planned Behaviour and self-esteem</field><field name="creator">Clark, Christine</field><field name="description">Adult students (n = 211) from a Private Training Establishment located in a low socio-economic area of Counties Manukau, New Zealand, were assessed for intent to achieve and actual outcome. Each year in New Zealand approximately 25% of students leaving school do so with no qualifications. It is estimated that in the Counties Manukau Region there are 77,000 adults with no educational qualifications, impacting on earning ability and on self-esteem. Failure rate at tertiary education is high, with 38% of under 18 year olds not achieving, and this figure worsens with age. The cost to New Zealand of having people not in employment, not in education and not in training is estimated to be close to $1.0 billion per year and in Counties Manukau the cost of youth unemployment is between $55 and $73 million per annum. This study applied The Theory of Planned Behaviour to assess intent to achieve, and was expanded to include a self-esteem component (Rosenberg&#8217;s Self-Esteem Scale, 1965). The Theory of Planned Behaviour sufficiently predicted intent, and was significantly improved with the self-esteem component. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale successfully predicted outcome, however findings need to be interpreted with caution. The initial self-esteem levels (M=20.59), whilst just above the accepted criteria (M=20.00) validate other studies indicating that New Zealand has an over-all low level of self-esteem compared with other similar countries. These findings indicate opportunity for future research into the prediction of outcome and ability of learning establishments to mitigate risk of non-achievement for the adult learner. They also support the further investigation of the low level of self-esteem as evidenced in this study.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Theory of Planned Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Self-esteem</field><field name="subject">Rosenburg</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smart monitoring systems for alert generation during anaesthesia</field><field name="creator">Baig, Mirza Mansoor</field><field name="description">Man has a limited ability to accurately and continuously analyse large amounts of data. Observers are typically required to monitor displays over extended periods and to execute overt detection responses to the appearance of low probability critical signals. The signals are usually clearly perceivable when observers are alerted to them, but they can be missed in the operating environment. The challenge is to develop a computer application that will accumulate information on a variable, or several variables, over time and identify when the trend in observations has changed. In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in patient monitoring and medical data analysis using decision support systems, smart alarm monitoring systems, expert systems and many other computer aided protocols. The expert systems have the potential to improve clinician performance by accurately executing repetitive tasks, to which humans are ill-suited. Anaesthetists working in the operating theatre are responsible for carrying out a multitude of tasks which requires constant vigilance and thus a need for a smart decision support system has arisen. The decision support tools capable of detecting pathological events can enhance the anaesthetist&#8217;s performance by providing alternative diagnostic information. The main goal of this research was to develop a clinically useful diagnostic alarm system using two different techniques for monitoring a pathological event during anaesthesia. Several techniques including fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, control and monitoring techniques were explored. Firstly, an industrial monitoring system called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software is used and implemented in the form of a prototype system called SCADA monitoring system (SMS). The output of the system in detecting hypovolaemia was classified into three levels; mild, moderate and severe using SCADA&#8217;s InTouch software. In addition, a new GUI display was developed for direct interaction with the anaesthetists. Secondly, a fuzzy logic monitoring system (FLMS) was developed using the fuzzy logic technique. New diagnostic rules and membership functions (MF) were developed using MATLAB. In addition, fuzzy inference system FIS, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system ANFIS and clustering techniques were explored for developing the FLMS&#8217;s diagnostic modules. The raw physiological patient data acquired from an S/5 monitor were converted to a readable format using the DOMonitor application. The data was filtered, preprocessed, and analysed for detecting anaesthesia related events like hypovolaemia. The accuracy of diagnoses generated by SMS and FLMS was validated by comparing their diagnostic information with the one provided by the anaesthetist for each patient. Kappa-analysis was used for measuring the level of agreement between the anaesthetist&#8217;s, SMS&#8217;s, and FLMS&#8217;s diagnoses. In offline analysis both systems were tested with data from 15 patients. The SMS and FLMS achieved an overall agreement level of 87 and 88 percent respectively. It implies substantial level of agreement between SMS or FLMS and the anaesthetists. These diagnostic alarm systems (SMS and FLMS) have shown that evidence-based expert diagnostic systems can diagnose hypovolaemia, with a substantial degree of accuracy, in anaesthetized patients and could be useful in providing decision support to anaesthetists.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smart monitoring systems</field><field name="subject">Anaesthesia monitoring</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy logic patient monitoring</field><field name="subject">SCADA monitoring</field><field name="subject">Alerts during physiological events</field><field name="subject">Warnings during anaesthesia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonsai</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Terry Hsu-Huang</field><field name="description">This thesis includes an introduction to my bonsai container design along with a history of bonsai, discussion of the philosophies of key bonsai masters, the details of two bonsai containers based on Japanese courtyard culture and Japanese architectural philosophy.

However, oak chips and shavings can substitute for barrels to add flavour to wine and are very much more cost effective. As with the heat treatment of barrels, oak chips are toasted before use. This serves to pyrolyse lignin and hemicellulose, generating families of compounds that impart desirable flavours to wine. Other woods are very occasionally used in wine barrel construction, but no chips other than oak chips have been used to flavour wine. This is surprising given that all woods contain lignin and hemicellulose, the composition of which will vary perhaps usefully from species to species. The 12 woods used in this research, including American oak, were chosen on several criteria: botanical similarly to oak, exclusivity to New Zealand, and historical association with New Zealand. The woods were cut to chips measuring about 10 x 20 x 2.5 mm. The moisture content was measured after dry heating to 110&#176;C. Fresh samples of chips were heated (toasting in the context of wine) to 200&#176;C for 2 hours, 210&#176;C for 3 hours, called light and heavy toasting respectively. Weight loss was determined. The colour of the untreated and toasted wood chips was measured in Hunter colour space, yielding data on lightness (L*), hue angle (the basic colour) and saturation (the intensity of colour). The moisture content of oak was the lowest of all the woods. The weight loss of oak chips at 200&#176;C was much greater than that of other woods, but the colour change did not indicate losses due to severe charring. Overall, each wood behaved in a distinctive way to the toasting treatments, with some charring much more than others. Hue was the least affected, indicating that the basic colour of the woods was little changed by toasting. Light and saturation generally decreased strongly, particularly on heavy toasting. Colour was thus being lost and less light reflected. An unoaked chardonnay was infused with toasted chips at the rate of 5 g.L-1 for two weeks at room temperature, and later decanted. At all stages exposure to air was minimised. The 25 treatments (2 x 12 plus the unwooded control) were first assessed by a panel comprising eight experienced wine tasters and 29 AUT staff members who claimed some knowledge of wine flavour. This qualitative/semi-quantitative analysis required tasters to assess the wines in terms of 12 descriptors commonly associated with oaked wines (boxes were ticked for &#8216;sweet oak&#8217;, &#8216;smokey&#8217;, &#8216;vanilla&#8217; etc.), and to choose the three most liked and the three least liked. 6 Confidential A principal component analysis of a correlation matrix of descriptors was used to summarise panelist&#8217;s opinion. The first two principal components explained 53 % of the variation and served to group descriptors into four quadrants, which were each associated with different woods and toasting levels. Most liked were totara light (toast), kahikatea heavy, manuka heavy and American oak light. Macrocarpa light toast was almost universally disliked. On the basis of liking and association with New Zealand, five woods and chosen toasting levels and the control were selected for hedonic trials (1 to 9 liking scale) with 180 consumers (age range and gender were identified) in six retail wine shops. The decreasing numerical of liking by treatment was totara (6.49), control, manuka, American oak, kahikatea, radiata pine (5.47), with an overall significant effect (P &lt; 0.001) for treatment. Tukey&#8217;s test revealed that only totara and the control treatments were outstanding (P &lt; 0.05). Retail wine shop as a factor was marginally significant. Older consumers liked the wines more (P &lt; 0.05), as did females (P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant interactions between any of the factors. Because of the difficulties in sourcing totara, manuka appears to be the most viable alternative to oak as a wine flavouring in the New Zealand context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flavour of wine treated with 12 toasted New Zealand woods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The analysis, design and evaluation of an unstructured bra</field><field name="creator">Niemczyk, Lize</field><field name="description">This practice-based research focuses on the analysis, design and evaluation of an unstructured push-up plunge bra, which combines technical know-how with the sensitivity of bra wearers.

Prior studies with woods other than oak have shown that unpleasant flavours from infusion of some woods could be linked to the presence of resin. The main thrust of this research was to test the hypothesis that any wood free of resin would be suitable for flavouring wine since all trees are composed of the same major constituents. The study involved various organic solvent extractions to remove resins from manuka, macrocarpa, totara, kahikatea, radiata pine, gorse, and American oak, prior to toasting and wine infusion. The woods were cut to a defined chip dimension, and Soxhlet-extracted with dichloromethane before toasting to 200 and 210&#176;C for two and three hours, respectively. These were the light and heavy toasts. In discriminative triangle trials comparing unextracted with resin-extracted infusion treatments in unwooded chardonnay at the two toasting levels, the 50 panellists could distinguish a difference in only three of the 14 trials. The exceptions were manuka heavy toast (P &lt; 0.01), and both macrocarpa toasts (P &lt; 0.05). The remaining 11 trials did not elicit significant levels of correct judgements from the panellists. The mass of resin recovered ranged from 1% (gorse) to 11 % (manuka), but there was no relationship between the quantity of resin and the discrimination results. Other parameters relating to the wood chips were measured in parallel to the discrimination trials. Colour changes in untoasted woods due to resin extraction were usually statistically significant but minor. Colour changes were unrelated to weight losses due to extraction. Light and heavy toasting resulted in significant and often major changes in colour parameters due to resin extraction. However there was no clear pattern of change and thus had no meaningful outcomes. In the discrimination trials, subtleties of the responses to macrocarpa and manuka, suggested that not all resin was extracted by the single extraction with dichloromethane. A further extraction of toasted chips not used for infusion showed that resinous matter was still present in all woods, although pyrolytic generation of dichloromethane-soluble matter could not be excluded. These collective results prompted an exhaustive extraction of wood chips prior to a hedonic trial with manuka, macrocarpa, and American oak. The solvents in sequence were dichloromethane, hexane and diethyl ether. Each extracted some resinous matter, clearly showing that the single dichloromethane extraction prior to the discrimination trials left some resin in the chips, potentially affecting wine flavour. The triple-extracted woods were light toasted and infused in wine destined for a hedonic trial in six retail wine shops, for which the overall statistical significance was P &lt; 0.001. The 121 consumers found that the unwooded chardonnay (control) was most favoured whereas the wine infused with macrocarpa was very significantly the least favoured. Its dislike was clearly caused by presence of its resin in the wine and/or because of a very low flavour threshold for that resin. The manuka treatment was numerically the most favoured ahead of American oak, but not significantly so. The resins extracted at various points of this study were also evaluated by panellists focusing on descriptive qualities. These descriptions and the results of the discrimination and hedonic trials led to the conclusion that variation in wine flavour when infused with toasted wood was in most cases not related to the occurrence of resin in woods. Finally, future research possibilities have been described, with an emphasis of the most potentially useful wood, manuka.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wine</field><field name="subject">Wood</field><field name="subject">Flavour</field><field name="subject">Resin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid on-line Glycogen measurement and prediction of ultimate pH in slaughter beef</field><field name="creator">Lomiwes, Dominic</field><field name="description">The rapid determination of glycogen on indicator muscle immediately after slaughter is advantageous as it permits the prediction of a muscle&#8217;s ultimate pH (pHu) and allows the identification of high pHu meat carcasses by extrapolation. This thesis examines the development of two rapid glycogen determination methods. The first aim of this thesis was to find a new glucometer to replace the Bayer ESPRIT&#8482; (Bayer) glucometer currently used in the Rapid pH (RpH) method. Roche&#8217;s Accuchek&#174; Advantage II (Accuchek) and Abbott&#8217;s Medisense Optium&#8482; (Medisense) glucometers were compared. Accuchek measurements exhibited a positive linear relationship in glucose standards made with water, RpH buffer and glucose spiked meat/buffer slurries ranging from 0 to 500 mg dL-1 (r2 = 0.999, 0.998 and 0.995 respectively). Medisense also exhibited a strong positive relationship for glucose standards made with water and RpH buffer; however, a non-linear trend in spiked meat slurries was observed. The second aim of this thesis was to explore the calibration of the KES K201 (KES Analysis Inc., NY, USA) near-infrared (NIR) diode array spectrometer to measure glycogen and pH at approximately 45 minutes after slaughter (pH45), and to predict pHu in pre-rigor M. longissimus dorsi (LD) from beef. This first required finding a reference method to calibrate against the NIR instrument. The RpH, Iodine and Bergmeyer methods were compared. Analysis of glycogen in replicate samples of three beef LD muscles at timepoints post-mortem (1, 4, 9 and 20 hours) was conducted. No significant difference in glycogen concentration was found between an enzymatic and an iodine based colorimetric method at each timepoint; however, the Iodine method was more consistent than the Bergmeyer method at all timepoints. Glucose measurements from the RpH method were consistent; however the pattern of glycogen decline at increasing timepoints post-mortem did not correspond with existing published studies. NIR spectra (538 to 1677 nm) of LD muscles from steers (n = 47), cows (n = 28) and bulls (n = 20) routinely slaughtered in a commercial abattoir were collected on-line approximately 45 minutes after slaughter. Poor results were obtained for Partial Least Squares (PLS) models generated from the mean reflectance spectra of each animal to measure glycogen and pH45, and predict pHu (r2 = 0.23, 0.37 and 0.20 respectively). A high mean square error of prediction (MSEP) for glycogen was also obtained (7.75). Validation of qualitative models generated with Generalised Partial Least Squares regression (GPLS) found that the optimum model was able to correctly categorise only 42% of high pHu samples with the remaining portion being wrongly classified as normal pHu meat. When the effect of gender was removed, only 21% of high pHu carcasses were correctly categorised. Exploratory analysis of the absorbance spectra of the LD muscles showed that a group composed predominantly of steers had a significantly lower pH45 than other existing groups. Further work is recommended for NIR to be successfully utilised on-line to measure glycogen or predict pHu in pre-rigor carcasses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glycogen</field><field name="subject">pH</field><field name="subject">Beef</field><field name="subject">NIR</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies into the relationship between GPCR43 and BuA-induced effects on colorectal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Zucker, Michelle Helen</field><field name="description">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major problem in affluent countries worldwide. In Australia it is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy with approximately 13,000 new cases diagnosed each year. This disease is also the leading cause of cancer related death in Australia with approximately 4,500 fatalities each year. Epidemiological studies have shown geographical variation in the incidence of disease, with diet considered to be a key contributing factor to CRC risk. In particular, diets high in fibre and low in fat have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of developing CRC. Fibre is heterogeneous in nature and can be categorised into different subtypes. Resistant starch is a component of fibre which remains largely intact throughout the gastrointestinal tract until it reaches the colon. Here it undergoes bacterial fermentation to produce the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate and butyrate (BuA). Each of the SCFAs are bioactive in the colon, with the most active being BuA. The beneficial effects of fibre have been linked to BuA&#8217;s ability to induce colon cancer cell differentiation, reduce proliferation and initiate apoptosis. Interestingly, in normal cells BuA is utilised as the preferential energy source and has been shown to promote proliferation. With an apparent &#8220;paradoxical effect&#8221; on normal and cancerous cells BuA has been the subject of much investigation as a potential anticancer agent. Despite numerous studies investigating BuA actions, the exact biological mechanisms remain largely undefined. This thesis explored a possible mechanism for BuA-induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. In 2003, two publications provided evidence that SCFAs, including BuA, were ligands to two members of a previously orphan family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs); GPCR41 and 43. Of the two receptors BuA had the strongest effect on GPCR43. Consequently this thesis investigated the possibility that BuA acts to decrease CRC proliferation and induce apoptosis by binding to and activating GPCR43 on CRC cells. It was hypothesised that GPCR43 acted as a &#8220;BuA sensor&#8221; on the surface of the cell to mediate the effects of BuA. This experimental work utilised PCR, Q-PCR, measures of apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation and RNAi knockdown. The key areas of investigation included: (1) Determining if GPCR43 was present on a range of CRC cell lines with a cell line to represent adenocarcinoma, carcinoma and metastatic stage of disease. (2) Investigating the expression of GPCR43 with manipulated nutrient media and different levels of cell confluence. (3) Exploring GPCR43 expression in normal and malignant human patient biopsies. (4) Determining if the inhibition of G-protein function using inhibitors influenced BuAinduced changes to apoptosis and proliferation. (5) Using RNAi, investigating the effect that GPCR43 knockdown would have on BuA-induced changes to proliferation and apoptosis. The key findings from this work included: (1) Presence of GPCR43 on some but not all CRC cell lines. (2) Modulation of GPCR43 expression with exposure to BuA and altered glucose concentrations in the media. (3) An influence of G-protein inhibition on BuA-induced apoptosis but not proliferation in some cell lines. (4) GPCR43 knockdown using RNAi indicated that GPCR43 is not exclusively required for BuA to regulate apoptosis and proliferation. The results from this work indicate that GPCR43 is not likely to exclusively mediate BuA&#8217;s effects, but opens up new areas of research into the exact role of GPCR43 on CRC cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">butyrate; colorectal cancer; GPCR43; apoptosis; proliferation</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) Cancer</field><field name="subject">Rectum Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation of an integrated approach to sustainable water management in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</field><field name="creator">Vo, Phu Le</field><field name="description">In 1986, Vietnam opened up the country&#8217;s economy by launching the Doi Moi (renovation) policy, which made the process of economic liberalisation possible. Accordingly, Ho Chi Minh City, the country&#8217;s biggest city, has undergone rapid growth of population, urbanisation and industrialisation. While achieving remarkable economic growth, the city faces considerable urban environmental challenges. The rapid growth of urbanisation and industry has placed increasing pressure on available freshwater resources, through excessive water use and increasing volumes of untreated wastewater. Firstly, the urban water sector has had to meet growing demand for water use for domestic purposes during the dry season. Secondly, groundwater levels have experienced a substantial drawdown in outlying urban districts as a result of over-abstraction. Thirdly, rapidly expanding industrial activities are causing severe demand on water resources. The city&#8217;s major supply sources have developed an alarming level of pollutants discharged by industry.  The aim of this thesis is to formulate an integrated approach to the sustainable management of water resources in Ho Chi Minh City. In order to achieve this, the research was designed to examine institutional frameworks and arrangements and to explore the perception of water value by water users and stakeholders. The underlying reasons for ineffective management are anchored in fragmented management practices which result from inadequate institutional frameworks and arrangements, inadequate regulations and inappropriate water governance. Weak enforcement of law and insufficient cooperation between government agencies and departments in Ho Chi Minh City and their counterparts in neighbouring provinces also limit management efficacy.  The research results show that stakeholders have different perceptions of water resources. Overall, water value has been considered as a social and economic good by both the urban respondents and government officials. However, most urban residents view water as a social good rather than an economic one. Public involvement in the water sector is limited. Most urban dwellers have little understanding and knowledge about the city&#8217;s water issues or the available channels to access information on water resources.  Many government officials are inadequately trained, poorly qualified, inexperienced and have irrelevant or outdated background knowledge about their field of management. Government respondents did not provide consistent data and information on the water profile because there is no shared common information on water issues in place. Findings from the fieldwork show that decentralisation, privatisation and using rainwater as a potential alternative water source are preferred.  Finally, the study proposes a schematic revision of existing management structures and mechanisms between local government agencies. This thesis proposes a model for a water conservation strategy for which the management and use of water resources is aligned with adequate institutional arrangements and effective regulations. Water governance and management of water resources need to work with economic and urbanisation growth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formulation; Integrated approach; Water management; Ho Chi Minh City; Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of mineral and bone metabolism in the systematic response to neurotrauma of adult males with spinal cord injury.</field><field name="creator">Clark, Jillian Mary</field><field name="description">Biochemical assays and radioabsorptiometry evaluated the relationship of mineral and bone metabolism to the systemic response to neurotrauma or orthopaedic trauma of adult males. Forty-one adult males (29.4&#177;9.3 years) participated of which 37 had a primary diagnosis of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and four were vertebral fracture controls. Biochemical abnormalities found included hyperphosphataemia, in association with low or low normal serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitmain D (1,25(OH)&#8322;D) and of parathyroid hormone (PTH), whilst patients remained normocalcaemic. These disturbances of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and the markedly accelerated resorption of bone were strongly associated with the interval since injury and the severity of injury, but none of these relationships was correlated with the level of the injury, the sensory status of a patient or the presence of spine fracture. The disturbances of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and the markedly accelerated resorption of bone found in this study are a mirror image of the data of patients with the heritable disorders autosomal dominant hyperphosphataemic rickets (ADHR), which results from an inactivating mutation of the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and autosomal recessive hypophosphataemic rickets (ARHR), which is caused by a mutation of the gene encoding dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1). It is potentially important that the hormone/proteolytic enzyme/extra-cellular matrix protein cascade associated with these disorders is counter-regulated by 1,25(OH)&#8322;D, acting either directly or indirectly. The present results suggest that the serum levels of 1,25(OH)&#8322;D of the neurotrauma patients chosen for study may have been inappropriately high with respect to the &#8220;physiological and metabolic set&#8221; of serum levels of phosphate and ionised calcium in the period corresponding to the uncoupling of the resorption and formation of bone, at least in males, prompting further investigation. The findings are consistent with a new &#8220;physiological set,&#8221; possibly involving an abnormality in the synthesis or processing of the endocrine fibroblast growth factors or other circulating phosphatonins, which may act as an additional level of regulation of the renal&#8211;bone axis, rather than renal failure. Strongly supporting this was the dynamic pattern of the biochemistry and radiological data of these neurotrauma patients and also, preliminary evidence of disturbances in circulating levels of other systemic modulators of mineral and bone metabolism. The relationships that were observed potentially may be explained by the diversity of the physiological activities of the endocrine fibroblast growth factors and the modes of actions of secreted FGF23 in bone. The findings provide an understanding of why bone loss occurs and may form the target for safe and cost effective interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spinal cord injury; osteoporosis; bone mineral density; vitamin D metabolism; phosphate metabolism</field><field name="subject">Nervous system Wounds and injuries Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Spinal cord.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Item noise versus context noise: using the list length effect to investigate the source of interference in recognition memory.</field><field name="creator">Kinnell, Angela</field><field name="description">The present thesis aimed to investigate the source of interference in recognition memory. There are two primary alternatives &#8211; the item noise approach, in which interference comes about as a consequence of the other items on the study list, and the context noise approach, wherein interference arises from the previous contexts in which an item has been encountered. Alternatively, interference may occur through a combination of both item and context noise. There are many mathematical models designed to simulate the recognition process that incorporate either item or context noise, or both. Item noise models predict a significant list length effect, that is, that memory for an item that was part of a short list at study is better than that for an item that was part of a long list. Context noise models no not predict a significant difference in memory based on the length of the study list. The presence or absence of the list length effect can therefore be used as a mechanism by which to differentiate item and context noise models. The list length effect is among the most documented and replicated findings in the recognition memory literature (Gronlund &amp; Elam, 1994). Yet, while many experiments have been conducted which have identified a significant list length effect in recognition (e.g. Bowles &amp; Glanzer, 1983; Cary &amp; Reder, 2003; Murnane &amp; Shiffrin, 1991; Ohrt &amp; Gronlund, 1999; Strong, 1912; Underwood, 1978), a number of published studies have failed to identify the effect (e.g. Dennis &amp; Humphreys, 2001; Dennis, Lee &amp; Kinnell, 2008; Jang &amp; Huber, 2008; Murnane &amp; Shiffrin, 1991; Schulman, 1974). Dennis and Humphreys (2001) argued that studies that had identified a significant effect of list length on recognition performance had done so because of a failure to control for four potentially confounding variables; retention interval, attention, displaced rehearsal and contextual reinstatement. The possible confounding effects of retention interval and displaced rehearsal are already well established in the literature and most studies employ some controls for these. Dennis et al. (2008) also found that while the role of contextual reinstatement had a pronounced influence on the detection of the list length effect it did not appear to be the most influential of the potential confounds. Thus, a major aim of the present thesis was to investigate the role of attention in the identification of the list length effect. Experiment 1 (N=160) involved two manipulations of attention. The first was to use either a retroactive or proactive design, with differential lapses of attention likely to be more pronounced in the latter. Second, in one condition participants were asked to perform a pleasantness rating task at study, a common technique to encourage participants to attend to the stimulus, while in the other condition they were asked to simply read the words. Results indicated that attention modulates the list length effect and that it is the retroactive versus proactive distinction which is most important as a significant effect of list length was found only when the proactive design was used. The encoding task had little effect. The design of Experiment 2 (N=80) was based on Cary and Reder's (2003) Experiment 3 which itself was a partial replication of Dennis and Humphreys' (2001) experiments. Cary and Reder introduced the Remember-Know (RK) task into the test list in their experiments and identified a significant effect of list length in the presence of controls for the four confounds where Dennis and Humphreys had not. The RK task is thought to index the relative contributions of familiarity and recollection in the recognition process (Gardiner, 1988). To the extent that the RK task encourages a recall-like process (see Clark, 1999; Diana, Reder, Arndt &amp; Park, 2006) it may influence the results regarding the list length effect, in that the effect is widely accepted to occur in recall. Experiment 2 compared recognition memory with or without RK instructions. One condition involved the standard yes/no recognition paradigm, while the other made us of the RK task following all &#8220;yes&#8221; responses. Controls for the four potential confounds of Dennis and Humphreys were implemented. No significant effect of list length was identified in the accuracy data of either condition, however there was a small but significant effect on median response latency for correct responses in the RK task condition. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that the effect of list length on recognition performance is negligible and nonsignificant when controls for the four potential confounds of list length are in place. However, both of these experiments, and almost all previous experiments investigating the list length effect, used words as the stimuli. The remaining four experiments in the present thesis (N=40 in each) sought to investigate the list length effect using stimuli other than words in an attempt to identify the boundary conditions of the effect. Each of these experiments followed the same basic method as Experiments 1 and 2. Four different kinds of stimuli were investigated, word pairs, images of novel faces, fractals and photographs. Results indicated a nonsignificant effect of list length for word pairs and photographs, however, there was a significant list length effect when faces (in the accuracy data) and fractals (in the response latency data) were used as the stimuli. However, all of the experiments in the present thesis used a within subjects manipulation of list length in order to maximise experimental power. This design may be an additional confound of the list length effect. The nature of the within subjects design means that by the end of the second study list, all participants will have studied the same number of items, thereby potentially removing any list length manipulation from the experiment. In addition, participants who studied the long list first may be more likely to be affected by lapses in attention than participants who began with the short list with this, rather than interference, the potential cause of any list length differences. In order to investigate this potential confounding, the results from all experiments of the present thesis were re-analysed using a between subjects analysis based on only the first list studied by each participant. The qualitative conclusions drawn from the majority of conditions remained unchanged. The between subjects analysis generally revealed larger effect sizes than did the within subjects analysis, although with the exception of the proactive conditions, these effects can be considered negligible to small at most. The pattern of results across the six experiments of the present thesis are problematic for existing mathematical models of recognition memory. While context noise models are able to account for negligible and nonsignificant effects of list length when words, word pairs and photographs are used as the stimuli, they are unable to predict a slightly larger and significant list length effect when the stimuli are novel faces or fractals. Conversely, while item noise models are able to account for a significant list length effect for faces and fractals, they are unable to predict a nonsignificant list length effect for words and word pairs. The results question whether either item or context noise can be taken as the sole source of interference in recognition memory. Rather, a combination of interference from different sources may be at work, with the precise nature of this combination dependent on the nature of the stimuli involved.

In this thesis I present 2.5-D frequency-domain equations of motion for elastic wave modelling in anisotropic media. The reduced set of equations for vertical transversely isotropic media and tilted transversely isotropic media are presented separately. Using the spectral-element method, I develop the equations of motion into readily implemented sub-equations by identifying simple 1-D and 2-D patterns. Some aspects of my computational implementation are unique, in particular the use of a system of dynamically growing binary trees to serve as a system matrix. Using this system, the matrix is automatically stored in compressed row format. I investigate the use of both distributed memory and shared memory super-computers for 3-D modelling and compare the resource use of various matrix solvers. In this thesis I adapt recently developed Perfectly Matched Layer formulations to the 2.5-D elastic case, and find them to be adequate in most situations. I investigate the possiblity of instability in the absorbing layers. Observation of 2.5-D modelling results in the frequency wavenumber domain uncovers polelike behaviour at critical wavenumbers within the spectrum. I demonstrate how this behaviour threatens the accuracy of the inverse Fourier transformed frequency-domain solution. However for inhomogeneous media, under certain conditions the only medium that exhibits pole-like behaviour is the medium containing the source. Further study of the phenomenon shows that in homogeneous, transversely isotropic media, the critical wavenumber values are not dependent on the receiver position, but rather can be predicted using the maximum phase velocities of the media. The recommended strategy for wavenumber sampling is to use dense even spacing of values, to adequately capture the behaviour close to the critical wavenumbers. A further recommendation it to introduce slight attenuation through the use of complex velocities (or elastic constants) to eliminate any pole-like behaviour at the critical values.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anistropic; spectral element; seismic; elastic; elastic wave modelling; 2.5D</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced numerical and experimental transient modelling of water and gas pipeline flows incorporating distributed and local effects.</field><field name="creator">Kim, Young Il</field><field name="description">One of the best opportunities to reduce pipeline accidents and subsequent product loss comes from implementing better pipeline condition assessment and fault detection systems. Transient analysis model based condition assessment is the most promising technique because pressure transients propagate entire system interacting with the pipe and any devices in the system. Transient measurements embody a large amount of information about the physical characteristics of the system. The performance of this technique has its difficulties because a highly accurate transient model is required. Real systems have numerous uncertainties and flow system components that presents a major challenge in the development of precise transient analysis models. To improve transient modelling for the performance of condition assessment, this research undertakes a comprehensive investigation into the transient behaviour of distributed and various local energy loss system components in water and gas pipelines. The dynamic behaviours that have been investigated in this research are the effect of unsteady wall resistance, viscoelasticity effects of polymer pipe, and local energy loss elements including leakages, entrapped air pockets, orifices, and blockages during unsteady pipe flow conditions. The dynamic characteristics of these system components are modelled based on the conservative solution scheme using the governing equations in their conservative form. Use of the conservative form of the equations improves the sensitivity and applicability of transient analysis in both liquid and gas pipeline systems. The numerical model results are compared to laboratory experiments in water and gas pipelines to observe the interaction between transient pressure wave and system components and to verify the proposed models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transients; water; gas; pipeline; unsteady pipeline condition assessment; leak detection; conservative solution scheme; unsteady friction leak; entrapped air pocket; orifice; blockage; viscoelasticity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure function analysis of the deubiquitylating enzyme Fam</field><field name="creator">Khut, Poon-Yu</field><field name="description">The ubiquitin pathway is a highly conserved post-translational modification system best characterised for its roles in protein degradation and intracellular trafficking and is involved in a diverse spectrum of cellular processes. Ubiquitylation is opposed by deubiquitylating enzymes (Dubs), and the ubiquitin specific peptidase (USP) class of Dubs remove ubiquitin from specific substrates, thereby affecting protein fate. USPs exhibit broad sequence diversity except over their catalytic cores and it has been suggested that this sequence variation constitutes their individual substrate-specific binding sites. Fat Facets in Mouse (Fam) is a developmentally regulated USP whose function is crucial for mouse pre-implantation development. Fam is expressed in a complex fashion throughout development in a number of diverse tissue types and time points, well beyond its critical role in the early embryo. Fam's orthologue in fly, Fat Facets (faf) is also developmentally regulated and is required for both drosophila eye and syncytial stage development. Given the strengths of the zebrafish system as a developmental tool, the zebrafish orthologue of Fam, usp9 was identified and found to be highly conserved. Analysis of its expression pattern found considerable overlap with the published mouse patterns. Given the similarities between the mouse and zebrafish systems, a series of cross-species experiments were conducted to determine whether exogenous expression of highly conserved regions of FAM, could cause dominant-negative phenotypes in developing zebrafish embryos. Outside of the catalytic core, FAM's large N and C-terminal extensions consist of novel sequence bearing no similarity to any known domain. To delineate FAM domains, fulllength FAM was expressed in insect cells and subjected to partial proteolysis. Combining this data with recent structural predictions and computer analyses of the FAM sequence, four FAM domains were characterised with the first domain containing three possible subdomains. The predominant helical nature of the N and C-terminal extensions of FAM were predicted to form scaffolding structures, well suited to protein binding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ubiquitin; proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of alternative bentonite treatments for heat-unstable white wine.</field><field name="creator">Muhlack, Richard Anthony</field><field name="description">Protein-induced wine haze is a major concern to the wine industry worldwide. While the presence of protein haze is unlikely to affect the sensory profile, consumers will generally reject wines containing hazes as they appear microbially spoiled. Consequently, an important step during commercial winemaking is to treat wines with bentonite, which removes heat unstable proteins by adsorption, and prevents haze formation. Whilst this process is effective, it is claimed to adversely affect the quality of the treated wine under certain conditions. Furthermore, 5-10% of the wine volume is typically occluded in bentonite lees. This wine is either lost or substantially diminished in quality and value during recovery. Therefore the development of alternative and economically viable process technologies that maintain wine quality and reduce costs would be highly desirable. This thesis is concerned with the development of alternative and innovative approaches to bentonite treatment of wine. Particular emphasis was placed on developing practical research outcomes that could be readily commercially adopted. Pursuant to this, fundamental research regarding the mechanics of protein adsorption onto bentonite was undertaken to gain an understanding of how bentonite properties relate to adsorption and settling behaviour in wine. The effect of bentonite heat treatment on protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour in a model wine was also investigated. In general, heating was found to increase the initial hindered settling velocity and reduce both protein adsorption capacity and the final volume of lees. Particle size, pH and cation exchangeability of bentonites and the changes that occur to these properties on heating are related to the nature of bonding between cations and the clay surface, as are protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour. Partial Least Squares (PLS) Analysis showed that the variance in individual cation exchangeability and the total cation exchange capacity was primarily responsible for the observed variance in protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour. PLS analysis was also used to develop correlations for the prediction of adsorption and settling behaviour, based on the physical and chemical properties of the bentonites tested. Qualitative comparison of the volume fraction of model wine occluded by each of the bentonites indicated that certain heat treatments may result in a combination of protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour which would produce a significant reduction in wine loss. The effect of different factors on adsorption of a purified grape protein (VVTL1) in a model wine was investigated using a factorial design approach with surface response analysis. Adsorption of VVTL1 by sodium bentonite was well characterised by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. pH, temperature, potassium concentration ([K]), and the pH*[K]interaction were all found to have a significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) on the adsorption capacity. Block effects appeared to correctly correlate with bentonite slurry age, suggesting that increasing slurry age may have a positive effect on adsorption capacity. Ethanol concentration, phenolic (caffeic acid and catechin)  oncentration, sugar (glucose and fructose) concentration, as well as the pH*temperature and temperature*[K] interactions did not have a significant effect. The equilibrium constant was found to be independent of the factors studied. This may be explained by changes in protein structure and charge with pH, which affect electrostatic interaction with the bentonite surface. Variation in potassium concentration can cause similar effects and may also influence adsorption capacity by affecting bentonite swelling and zeta potential. This knowledge was applied to the development of in-line dosing of bentonite as an alternative process strategy for commercial use. Field tests of in-line dosing at a commercial winery were conducted on a Sultana wine and Gordo (Muscat of Alexandria) juice with Vitiben and SIHA-Aktiv-Bentonit G bentonites. Fining performance was monitored by heat testing and quantification of heat unstable protein by HPLC. Heat test turbidity and heat unstable protein concentration were reduced in a similar manner upon fining. These reductions were achieved with a contact time of less than two minutes. Sensory evaluation of Sultana wine fined with Vitiben by balanced reference duo-trio difference tests did not detect any difference between untreated, in-line dosed and batch fined wine. A dynamic simulation model of in-line dosing was developed and compared with field trial results, marking the first quantitative study of the dynamic adsorption kinetics of wine protein adsorption onto bentonite. The simulation results confirmed the rapid adsorption behaviour observed during field testing, and provided strong evidence that protein adsorption occurs predominantly on the external particle surface only, with adsorption kinetics being limited by external-film mass transfer. Incomplete separation of bentonite from wine/juice during centrifugation produced a carryover of up to 30% of the added bentonite into the clarified wine. If this problem can be overcome, use of in-line dosing instead of batch fining could eliminate significant value losses presently arising from quality downgrades of wine recovered from bentonite lees by rotary drum vacuum filtration. Moreover, in-line dosing of selected heattreated bentonites under optimal wine or juice conditions may provide even further costs savings whilst maintaining wine quality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wine and winemaking; bentonite</field><field name="subject">Bentonite.</field><field name="subject">White wines.</field><field name="subject">Wine and wine making.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sedimentological and geochemical approach to understanding cycles of stratovolcano growth and collapse at Mt Taranaki, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zernack, Anke Verena</field><field name="description">The long-term behaviour of andesitic stratovolcanoes is characterised by a repetition of edifice growth and collapse phases. This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the conservation of New Zealand's threatened biodiversity : management, species recovery and legislation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Ecology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Seabrook-Davison, Mark Nicholas Hawdon</field><field name="description">Content removed from thesis due to copyright restrictions: Seabrook-Davison, M.

The interactions between distinct classes of transcription factors form an intricate network and hierarchy, allowing fine control of gene expression and strict control of pigment production.

An Indonesian case study of parental participation in school management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fitriah, Amaliah</field><field name="description">A prominent idea in the decentralisation and development literature is that decentralisation leads to deeper and stronger community participation. This thesis seeks to examine this argument by investigating the practice of community participation in the Indonesian decentralisation context, focusing on parental participation through access to and control over school financial resources. Drawing on a case study in Depok city, the practice of parental involvement has been explored by identifying the characteristics and the extent of parents&#8217; participation in school management. School Committees (SCs), as a mechanism of community involvement provided by the decentralised education policy, were also examined in this research to develop an understanding of parental representation in school management. The study found that the characteristics and the extent of parents&#8217; participation in school management have changed and decreased significantly as a result of a new Free School Programme (FSP) introduced by the government in 2009 which freed parents from school operational cost. Prior to FSP, parents actively participated in terms of supplying resources and involvement in school meetings, had some access to financial information, and had limited engagement with school budgeting through representation in SCs. However, the new absence of financial contribution by parents has affected parental participation by transforming it into a weaker form of participation where parents act as mere beneficiaries. The study also revealed that in the Indonesian context, the SCs, as institutional channels for community involvement in education provided by the education decentralisation policy, are not effective in terms of representing and engaging parents in school management. Based on the evidence above, this thesis concluded that in the context of the Indonesian education system, decentralisation has not necessarily enhanced community participation. In this respect, decentralisation is not the only possible answer for achieving a meaningful and empowering parental participation in education. Furthermore, other contextual factors surrounding participation also have to be taken into account. While FSP brings the benefit of allowing students to access education freely, the absence of parental financial contribution has been proved to impact parental participation in a way that is contradictory to one of the purposes of decentralisation policy, which is to engage the community in educational management.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School management</field><field name="subject">Free School Programme, Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Educational decentralisation</field><field name="subject">Indonesian education system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mind the gap! : policy change in practice : school qualifications reform in New Zealand, 1980-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Alison, Judie</field><field name="description">'Policy gaps' in education mean that the visions of policy-makers frequently fail to materialise fully, or at all, in teacher practice. This thesis argues that a significant 'policy gap' developed in New Zealand around school qualifications policy during the 1990's, and puts forward some explanations for that. A significant shift in government discourses over that period, from largely social democratic to predominantly neo-liberal discourses, was not matched by a similar shift in the discourses of teachers or the union that represents them. During the same period, teachers and their representative bodies were excluded from policy development, reflecting this shift in government discourses. Government and teachers were 'talking past each other'. As a result, qualifications reforms that might have been expected to be generally welcomed by the profession, as a government response to calls from the profession over many decades, were instead rejected by the majority of teachers. Furthermore, the absence of the teacher voice from policy development meant that the shape of the reforms moved significantly away from the profession's original vision, a further reason for its unacceptability to teachers. Reform was only able to be achieved when teachers and their union were brought back into the policy-making and policy-communicating processes and a version of standards-based assessment closer to the union's original vision was adopted by government. Nevertheless, the National Certificate of Educational Achievement that resulted appears to still be perceived by teachers as externally imposed and its origins in the profession's advocacy for reform over many years have been lost. This indicates that 'policy gaps', while easily opened, are not as easily closed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational tests and measurements</field><field name="subject">National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA)</field><field name="subject">Educational change</field><field name="subject">Education and state</field><field name="subject">High school students</field><field name="subject">Secondary school students</field><field name="subject">Education policy</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330109 Assessment and evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling heat transfer in butter products : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.

Understanding these temperature changes are of vital importance for the dairy industry with regard to butter manufacture, storage and shipping. Three dimensional mathematical models of heat transfer were developed to predict thawing and freezing in butter products. These models require accurate thermophysical data as an input. Specific heat capacity and enthalpy of butter with different composition was measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The specific heat capacity of butter differs for cooling and heating operations due to significant supercooling and delayed crystallization of the fat fraction of butter at temperatures well below the equilibrium phase change temperature during cooling. This reduces the heat capacity for cooling relative to that for heating. Thawing of individual blocks of butter was accurately predicted by the conduction only model (no mass transfer limitations) with equilibrium thermal properties giving accurate predictions when the butter was completely frozen before thawing. For partially frozen butter the conduction model with the measured temperature dependent specific heat capacity data for unfrozen butter including melting of some of the fat fraction gave accurate predictions. For freezing it was observed that water in the butter supercools many degrees below its initial freezing point before freezing due to its water in oil structure. Experiments suggested that during freezing release of latent heat observed as a temperature rebound is controlled as much by the rate of crystallisation of water in each of the water droplets as by the rate of heat transfer. A conduction only model including water crystallization kinetics based on the Avrami Model predicted freezing in butter successfully. Simple models with equilibrium thermal properties and nucleation only kinetics (based on homogenous nucleation theory) or the sensible heat only model (no release of latent heat) gave poor predictions. The models for individual blocks were extended to predict heat transfer in butter pallets. A butter pallet contains product, packaging material and the air entrapped between the packaging and butter cartons. Measurements were made for freezing and thawing of full and half pallets at a commercial storage facility and in the University laboratory. Thawing and freezing in wrapped tightly stacked pallets was predicted accurately by the conduction only model with effective thermal properties (incorporating butter, packaging and air) estimated by the parallel model. For unwrapped tightly stacked or loosely stacked pallets there is potential for air flow between the adjacent cartons of butter. An alternative approach was developed which consisted of modeling the pallet on block by block basis using effective heat transfer coefficients for each surface. Different heat transfer coefficients were used on different faces of the blocks depending on the location of the block in the pallet. This approach gave good predictions for both unwrapped tightly stacked and loosely stacked pallets using the estimated effective heat transfer coefficients from the measured data.

As the timing for fertilisation can be decisive for avoiding deleterious effects, improvements in the description of the sulphur balance in fields are a valuable contribution for assisting fertiliser management. Sulphate is the most important inorganic form of sulphur in soils. Being the mobile form, sulphate is readily available for plants, and also prone to be leached. Therefore the description of the movement of sulphate is the key component of the sulphur balance. Leaching of sulphate from the soil can be significantly delayed by its adsorption onto the soil particles. Soil type and pH are the main factors defining the sulphate adsorption capacity; although the presence of other ions in the soil solution can have a considerable effect. It has been reported that in some soils, typically volcanic and tropical soils with variable-charge characteristics, the co-presence of sulphate and calcium can substantially enhance their retention via ion-pair adsorption (IPA). To determine the influence of cations on the movement of sulphate, series of batch and miscible displacement experiments were conducted using two New Zealand soils, of contrasting ion adsorption capacities: the Taupo sandy and Egmont loam soils. These experiments demonstrated the occurrence of cooperative adsorption of sulphate and calcium in the Egmont soil, but not in the Taupo soil. Batch experiments were conducted to examine the IPA adsorption process in the Egmont soil in more detail. Based on the analyses of the results from these two series of experiments, plus the review of published data, three different mathematical approaches for evaluating the amount of solute adsorbed as ion-pairs are proposed. A computer program was built for solving an adsorption model using these three approaches, and was used to compare the model's predictions and the observed adsorption data. An extension of this program, coupling the adsorption model with a solute transport description, was used to simulate the movement of sulphate and calcium. Comparisons between the data from the miscible displacements and the results from this model are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed IPA description for modelling the transport of these ions in the soil. Finally, results from a pot trial with Egmont soil are used to examine the relevance of IPA for the movement of sulphate under non-equilibrium conditions, and with active plant growth. Although the results from this experiment regarding IPA were statistically non-significant, some insights could be obtained and are discussed. More studies involving IPA under non-equilibrium experiments are needed for a better understanding of the relevance of IPA in field conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soils sulphur content</field><field name="subject">Soils fertiliser movement</field><field name="subject">Leaching</field><field name="subject">Sulphur fertilisers</field><field name="subject">Calcium</field><field name="subject">Ion-pair adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of ACC oxidase from the leaves of Malus domestica Borkh. (apple) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Molecular BioSciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Binnie, Jan E.</field><field name="description">The expression, accumulation and kinetic properties of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase (ACO), the enzyme which catalyses the final step in the ACC-dependent pathway of ethylene biosynthesis in plants, is examined. The investigation is divided into three sections: (i) identification of two ACO genes in apple leaf tissue, designated MD-ACO2 and MD-ACO3, (ii) kinetic analyses of each of the three isoforms of ACO in apple (MD-ACO1, MD-ACO2 and MD-ACO3) expressed in E. coli, and (iii) temporal and developmental expression in vivo of each of the ACO genes and accumulation of the corresponding gene products in leaf and fruit tissue. The coding regions of putative ACO gene transcripts were generated from leaf tissue using RT-PCR. Sequence alignments and interrogation of the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) database indicated that the entire open reading frame (ORF) sequences were encoded by two distinct genes, and these are designated MD-ACO2 and MD-ACO3. A third ACO gene had been identified in apple by other research workers previously, and designated MD-ACO1. Differences are obvious in the number of base-pairs (bp) constituting the entire ORF of MD-ACO1 (942 bp), MD-ACO2 (990 bp) and MD-ACO3 (966 bp). MD-ACO1 and MD-ACO2 share a close nucleotide sequence identity of 93.9 % in the ORF but diverge in the 3' untranslated regions (3' -UTR) (69.5 %). In contrast, MD-ACO3 shares a lower sequence identity with both MD-ACO1 (78.5 %) and MD-ACO2 (77.8 %) in the ORF, and in the 3'-UTR (MD-ACO1, 68.4 %; MD-ACO2, 71 %). A comparison of the gene structures show that the endonuclease restriction sites are unique to each individual MD-ACO sequence. Genomic Southern analysis, using probes spanning the 3'-UTR and the 3'-end of the coding region confirmed that MD-ACO3 is encoded by a distinct gene. However, while the distinction between MD-ACO1 and MD-ACO2 is not as definitive, different gene expression patterns adds credence to their distinctiveness. Each of the three deduced amino acid sequences contain all of the residues hitherto reported to be necessary for maximal ACO activity. Expression of MD-ACO1, MD-ACO2 and MD-ACO3 as fusion proteins in E. coli was induced using isopropy1-&#946;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), the recombinant proteins purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NiNTA) affinity chromatography and the products had predicted masses determined from the nucleotide sequences, including the His-tag of 38.53 kDa (MD-ACO1), 40.39 kDa (MD-ACO2) and 39.3 kDa (MD-ACO3). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the MD-ACO3 fusion in rabbit for western blot analysis. Antibodies had been raised previously against recombinant MD-ACO1, and while it was considered likely the MD-ACO2 would be recognized by the MD-ACO1 antibodies, MD-ACO2 does not appear to be recognized in vivo by the antibody. Analyses of the kinetic properties of the three apple ACOs was undertaken. Apparent Michaelis constants (Km) of 89.39 &#956;M (MD-ACO1), 401.03 &#956;M (MD-ACO2) and 244.5 &#956;M (MD-ACO3) have been determined which suggests differences in the affinity of each enzyme for the substrate ACC. Maximum velocity (Vmax) was determined for MD-ACO1 (15.15 nmol), MD-ACO2 (12.94 nmol) and MD-ACO3 (18.94 nmol). The catalytic constant (Kcat) was determined for MD-ACO1 (6.6 x 10-2), MD-ACO2 (3.44 x 10-2) and for MD-ACO3 (9.14 x 10-2), with kcat/Km(&#956;M s-1) values of 7.38 x 10-4 &#956;M s-1 (MD-ACO1), 0.86 x 10-4 M s-1 (MD-ACO2) and 3.8 x 10-4 &#956;M s-1 (MD-ACO3). The optimal pH for MD-ACO1 was 7.0 - 7.5, MD-ACO2 7.5 - 8.0 and MD-ACO3 7.0 - 8.0. All three isoforms exhibited absolute requirements for the co-substrate ascorbate in vitro with optimal activity at 30 mM. Similarly, ferrous iron (FeSO4.7H20; of 15 - 25 &#956;M) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3; of 30 mM) were required for optimal activity, and were the same for all isoforms. No significant difference in thermostability was found in this study between the MD-ACO isoforms at the P = 0.05 level. However, the activities of the enzyme differed significantly between temperatures over time. In vivo expression of each of the ACO genes in leaf tissue determined using RT-PCR and cDNA Southern analysis reveal that both MD-ACO2 and MD-ACO3 are expressed in young leaf tissue and in mature leaf tissue. While MD-ACO3 is expressed predominantly in young leaf tissue, MD-ACO2 (in common with MD-ACO1) is expressed predominantly in mature fruit tissue. None of the MD-ACOs were observed to be senescence associated genes (SAG). MD-ACO3 protein accumulated predominantly in young leaf tissue and less intensely in both mature leaf tissue and young fruit tissue, while MD-ACO1 accumulated only in mature fruit tissue. For the developmental studies, samples were collected at approximately 11 am in this study. MD-ACO2 and MD-ACO3 were also expressed in leaf tissue collected over a 24 h period in the spring and also in the autumn. For both genes transcripts accumulated in the presence of fruit but tended to disappear in the absence of fruit. These results show that MD-ACO1, MD-ACO2 and MD-ACO3 are differentially expressed, and that MD-ACO3 is encoded by a gene distinct from MD-ACO1 and MD-ACO2. MD-ACO1 and MD-ACO2 are either allelic forms of the same gene or closely clustered. Although there is some variation in kinetic properties which may reflect different physiological environments, they do not vary greatly.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apple genetics</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nucleation and growth of alpha lactose monohydrate : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Process Engineering at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Mcleod, Jeremy</field><field name="description">Lactose represents approximately one third of the total solids in bovine milk. In the dairy industry, lactose is recovered from whey and whey permeates using a crystallisation process that involves both evaporation and a cooling stage. A good understanding of the lactose crystallisation kinetics enables both these processes to be operated at conditions that maximise the yield and minimise capital and processing costs. This study has looked at the nucleation and growth kinetics of the lactose crystallisation process. A model has been produced that can accurately predict the changing concentration profile as lactose is removed, via growth, from an industrial solution. This model incorporated the available literature information and expanded on it where required. The primary nucleation of alpha lactose monohydrate was investigated on the laboratory scale. The work identified the changing relationship, which occurs with increasing supersaturation, as lactose nucleation moves from being dominated by the heterogeneous mechanism to the homogenous mechanism. The absolute supersaturation at which the mechanism changes was found not to be affected by the solution temperature and agitation rate; however the presence of impurities lowered the supersaturation required for homogeneous nucleation. The effect of mixing on the primary nucleation rate was studied in a Rushton turbine agitated vessel and through a Venturi. Increasing the agitation rate increased the frequency of activated molecular collisions but the critical nucleus size remained constant. A strong correlation was found, for both mixing systems, between the nucleation rate and the frequency of vortex shedding.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lactose</field><field name="subject">Nucleation</field><field name="subject">Dairy products</field><field name="subject">Milk processing</field><field name="subject">Process Engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology of Johne's disease in New Zealand dairy herds : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Norton, Solis</field><field name="description">Johne's disease (JD), caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a chronic, debilitating enteritis of cattle, other domestic livestock and some wildlife species. JD was first identified in the late 1800s and today it is a worldwide problem in dairy cattle. Heavily infected cows have reduced milk production, a higher risk of removal from the herd and low slaughter value. Several countries have implemented national level control strategies. In New Zealand, JD was first reported in 1912 and today the prevalence of infected dairy herds is thought to be high. To improve our understanding of the epidemiology of JD and to evaluate the feasibility of a national control strategy, four studies were conducted. The first study was a questionnaire based case-control study to identify associations between management practices and the occurrence of clinical JD on farms from four regions of New Zealand. The second study was on the effect of sub-clinical JD on milk production and the risk of removal from the herd in four dairy herds over four milking seasons. The effect of misclassification of disease status on productivity estimates was also studied. In the third study diagnostic test result data from the productivity study was combined with a novel Bayesian regression model to estimate performance of the ELISA and faecal culture tests as a function of covariates and utilising repeated tests on individual cows. Finally, results from these three studies were used to adapt an existing JD simulation model, 'JohneSSim', to represent the epidemiological behaviour of JD in New Zealand dairy herds. Control strategies for the disease were simulated and evaluated based on their cost effectiveness. Of the 427 farmers responding to the questionnaire, 47% had suspected clinical cases of JD in their herd in the preceding 5 years. Only 13% of suspected infected herds had an average incidence of greater than 0.5 cases per 100 cow years at risk. The disease was not considered a serious problem by 20% of herd managers who reported the presence of disease in the preceding 5 years. The presence of Jersey cows in the herd and the purchase of bulls had strong positive associations with the presence of clinical JD. Grazing calves in the hospital paddock, larger herds, the purchase of heifers, and the use of induction were also positively associated with JD. In the productivity study the herd-level prevalence of JD by ELISA and/or faecal culture ranged from 4.5% (95% CI 2.6-6.9) to 14.2% (95% CI 9.2-20.6). Daily milksolids production by JD positive cows was 0.8% (95% CI -6.1%-4.5%) less than that of JD negative cows. However in herd D, JD positive cows produced 15.5%, (95% CI 6.75%-24.2%) milksolids less than JD negative herd mates daily. This equates to a loss of 53kg of milksolids/305 day lactation, or NZD 265/lactation, given a price of NZD 5/kg of milksolids. In herd D only, the annual hazard ratio of removal for JD positive cows was significantly increased. It was 4.7 times and 1.4 times higher in cows older than 5 years and younger than 5 years. The results were insensitive to misclassification. Analysis of the diagnostic test data demonstrated the strengths of our Bayesian regression model. While overall estimates of sensitivity and specificity by this method were comparable to estimates by existing methods, it showed a broad trend of increasing sensitivity in higher parity groups and higher sensitivity in early, relative to late, lactation. It also showed that estimates of prevalence may in fact decline with repeated, relative to single, testing. Our novel approach demonstrated trends that could not be shown by existing methods, but could be improved by application to a larger data set. Simulation showed that control strategies for JD based on either test-and-cull, vaccination, breeding for genetic resistance, or removal of offspring from clinically affected cows, were not cost effective for the average infected herd. Improvement of the hygiene associated with calf management provided the greatest reduction in the within-herd prevalence of JD. While JD is present in a high proportion of New Zealand dairy herds, the incidence of clinical cases is usually low, and most farmers consider it to be of little importance. However, JD causes significant losses in productivity in some herds. The disease would probably be best controlled on a herd-by-herd basis, given the limited success of national-scale control programs for JD in other countries. The education of dairy farmers regarding risky management practices, and the offer of a risk assessment to farmers wishing to control the disease, would provide a combination of wide reaching and targeted approaches, of low cost, for JD control. It seems likely that JD will persist in some capacity in the years ahead, but will remain of minor concern next to major animal health issues, such as infertility and mastitis. Clarification of the effect of genetic strain on the virulence of MAP may help explain differences in the effect of the disease between herds. This knowledge could then be used to further improve the efficiency of JD control.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Johne's disease</field><field name="subject">Paratuberculosis</field><field name="subject">Veterinary epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Dairy cattle diseases</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dyadic partner perspectives of ageing with hearing handicap in the audible world : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Blakey, Judy Ann</field><field name="description">Grounded in Green and Kreuter's (1991) flexible research framework (the PRECEDE model), the prime purpose of this doctoral research agenda has been to enhance our understanding of the frequently obscure psychosocial implications of ageing with hearing handicap (HH) in the audible world, by focusing on the dyadic perspectives of older New Zealand (NZ) ex-service personnel and their spouses. Glass and Balfour's (2003) Ecological Model of Ageing guided the multidisciplinary literature review, in order to accommodate the functional implications of age-related losses which could potentially exacerbate the social and emotional sequelae of ageing with HH and tinnitus. In addition, Cohen's (1992) Transactional Model of Stress (which integrates three social support constructs with Lazarus and Folkman's [1984] model describing adaptations to stressful events), illustrates how on-going social and emotional adjustments to hearing losses could potentially affect older adults' health-related quality of life (H-QoL). Infused by these transdisciplinary ecological perspectives, a composite model of Ageing with Hearing Handicap was proposed to explore older dyadic partner perspectives of NZ veterans' adjustment to ageing with hearing handicap; and to identify which factors exerted the most influence over the veterans' self-reported perceptions of HH and H-QoL. Methods: A purposive pilot study sample (N=51 veterans) initially guided the appropriate selection of ecologically relevant biopsychosocial variables and data collection methods (self-report mail out booklets) for two subsequent studies: (i) The main 'parent' study (referred to as the Hearing Aid Research Project [HARP]), which examined the predictors of hearing aid use in veterans aged 50 year and older; and (ii) The doctoral study, which explored dyadic perspectives of ageing with HH. The doctoral study's dyadic partner sample (N=671 dyads) comprised a subset of the 1249 HARP veterans. This subset met the doctoral study's inclusion criteria of male veterans aged 65 years plus, who had responded with a female partner/spouse residing in the same household. Only dyads with reasonably complete mail out survey response sets were selected. The dyadic partner response sets included social demographic details and responses to a number of constructs relevant to the doctoral research context including: aural rehabilitation, HH, H-QoL, emotional wellbeing, social support and memory in everyday life. Results: The results describe significantly different aural rehabilitation coping trajectories between the self-identified 'first time' and more experienced hearing aid users; and dyadic partner comparisons which highlight that the female partners were more acutely aware of the stigmatising impact of hearing losses on the veterans' social and emotional agency. Analyses of the intersecting structural and functional features of social support illustrated that increasing levels of the veterans' hearing handicap (HH) exacerbated both partners' social isolation. Wenger's (1994) support network typology illustrated how both partners' depressive symptoms and the veterans' frequency of forgetting increased significantly across a socially integrated to isolated support network continuum. The composite model of Ageing with Hearing Handicap accounted for 71.5% of the variation in the veterans' self-reported HH; 62.6% of their physical and 37.3% of their mental H-QoL. The multivariate analyses also demonstrated that HH produced a direct and negative impact on the veterans' mental H-QoL, by constraining their social and emotional agency; but only indirectly on their physical H-QoL, through reducing their energy levels and constraining their social participation. Conclusions: These transdisciplinary perspectives provide cross-sectional insights about the social and emotional wellbeing of veterans ageing with HH and their spouses, and suggest downstream links that affect their H-QoL. These findings highlight the importance of hearing health policy agendas and the communication contexts of health service delivery across all age groups. Moreover, by resolving the complex methodological and conceptual challenges inherent in focussing on older dyadic partners' everyday experiences, targets have become apparent for further investigation, to enhance and refine our understandings of engaging ecological perspectives when conducting health research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older deaf people</field><field name="subject">Hearing loss</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380101 Sensory processes perception and performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blogs, political discussion and the 2005 New Zealand general election : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hopkins, Kane</field><field name="description">Communication technologies have altered the way people engage in political discourse. In recent years the internet has played a significant role in changing the way people receive political information, news and opinion. Perhaps the most significant difference as a result of advancements in communication and internet technology is how people participate in discussions and deliberate issues that are important to them. The 2005 New Zealand General Election fell at a time when functionality and access to fast and affordable internet allowed people to develop their own information channels and also determine how, where and to what level they participated in debate and commentary on election issues. The aim of this thesis is to examine how blogs were used to discuss political issues during the 2005 New Zealand General Election campaign period through the use of three inter-related methodologies. The methodologies used in the research are content analysis, interviews and a case study. Four blogs and the comments sections are analysed by way of content analysis for adherence to the rules of communicative interaction within the public sphere. Interviews were conducted with a number of people who blogged during the 2005 election campaign, to develop an understanding of their experiences and perceptions of the role blogging played in the election. A case study of politician and blogger Rodney Hide examines the role blogs play as a communication tool for politicians and the how they change the relationship between politician and voter. An explosion of academic literature in recent years has looked at the participative and deliberative nature of the internet and blogs as having opened new spaces and what implications that may have for democracy. Jurgen Habermas' seminal book, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, provides the theoretical basis for this thesis and the foundation for academic writing in this area. Habermas developed the normative notion of the public sphere as a part of social life where citizens exchanged views and opinions on matters of importance to the common good, so that wider public opinion can be formed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blogs political aspects</field><field name="subject">Political campaigns</field><field name="subject">2005 General Elections</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420304 Screen and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of nitrogen loss pathways in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) growing agro-ecosystems on volcanic ash soils in Papua New Guinea : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Murom, Banabas</field><field name="description">Oil palm is the largest national crop produced in Papua New Guinea. It is grown on over 80,000 ha of young volcanic soils in five Provinces, employs over 12,000 workers and uses &gt;12,000 tonnes of fertiliser to offset nitrogen deficiency which is the most limiting factor to production. Oil palms strip out 160 - 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1 from the soil. Nitrogen fertilisers account for 60-70 % of all variable production costs but 40-60 % of applied fertiliser cannot be accounted for. Few studies have investigated the amounts of nitrogen lost via leaching, denitrification, volatilisation or as surface runoff in tropical soils and none have been done in Papua New Guinea. Oil palm soils typically have extremely high infiltrabilities (80-8,500 mm hr-1) and receive high annual rainfall which throughfall makes spatially non-uniform. The objective of this study was to assess and quantify nitrogen losses and suggest strategies that might assist in reducing them and their impact on the environment. The modest facilities available at the two research sites, West New Britain (Dami) and Oro (Sangara) Provinces, meant that no analytical work could be done on-site, so simple but appropriate methods were used to evaluate losses, with samples collected, preserved and sent off-shore for analysis. Large four-palm plots were used to evaluate runoff; a gas trap was used to collect evolved nitrous oxide, and lysimeters, suction cups and finally an in situ destructive soil sampling procedure were all used to assess leaching losses and the rate of nitrification of ammonium fertiliser. Results suggest that under the extreme total annual rainfall at Dami (3,500-4,000 mm) and to a lesser extent at Sangara (2,500-3,000 mm), leaching is the dominant loss pathway, with the rate of loss depending, to some extent, on the rate of nitrate formation and the retentivity of the soil for ammonium, but mainly on the rate at which drainage water is generated. A leaching model was developed that indicated that the average residence time of nitrogen fertiliser in the root zone (0-50 cm) varied from 21 days in February, at Dami, to 190 days in May, at Sangara.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitrogen deficiency</field><field name="subject">Soil run-off</field><field name="subject">Leaching</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of a secreted immunogenic protein, phase-1 flagellin (FliC) of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica Brandenburg : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Microbiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Perera, Kalyani</field><field name="description">Cell-envelope associated and secreted proteins of Salmonella are integral for host-pathogen interactions, and for the induction of protective immune responses. An array of exported proteins of S. Brandenburg was identified through constructing an expression library using alkaline phosphatase gene technology. A partial digest of S. Brandenburg strain S59 was cloned into the vector pJEM11, and expressed in E. coli. The DNA inserts from randomly selected alkaline phosphatase positive clones were sequenced, and the sequences were analysed using public databases to find the ones that may play a role in host immune cell activation. The phase-1 flagellin (fliC) gene identified from an alkaline phosphatase positive phenotype was chosen for further studies. The complete nucleic acid sequence of the fliC gene was obtained by PCR amplification. The complete ORF, part of the variable region (V456) and region IV (V4) of the fliC gene were cloned into the pET14b vector for the expression of N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion proteins. The proteins were purified through metal affinity chromatography, and were evaluated for their humoral immunogenic properties by Western blotting with sera collected from 81 sheep naturally infected with S. Brandenburg. All 81 naturally infected sheep had IgG antibodies against recombinant FliC, V456, and V4 proteins. Furthermore, Western blotting of sera from 6 salvexinTM+B-vaccinated sheep (Trial 2004) had IgG antibodies against the 3 recombinant proteins. Whole blood cells of vaccinated sheep did not show interferon-gamma production upon stimulation with recombinant FliC and V456 proteins. Western blotting of sera from sheep vaccinated with salvexinTM and salvexinTM+B (Trial 1999), and those from rabbits vaccinated with S. Brandenburg, S. Hindmarsh and S. Typhimurium suggested that recombinant V4 contains epitopes specific for S. Brandenburg. Therefore, V4 was used to develop a novel indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of serum IgG antibodies in S. Brandenburg infected sheep. The ELISA showed a specificity of 100%, and a sensitivity of 93.8%. Furthermore, a new PCR assay was developed targeting rfbJ(B) gene in a single reaction, and genes invA, fliC and fljB in a multiplex reaction for the identification of S. Brandenburg from pure cultures. The sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was calculated to be 100%.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salmonella enterica Brandenburg genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Characterisation</field><field name="subject">Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300507 Microbiology (excl.virology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive trait model for adaptive learning environments : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information System [i.e. Systems], Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lin, Tai-Yu</field><field name="description">Among student modelling researches, domain-independent student models have usually been a rarity. They are valued because of reusability and economy. The demand on domain-independent student models is further increased by the need to stay competitive in the so-called knowledge economy nowadays and the widespread practice of lifelong learning. On the other hand, the popularity of student-oriented pedagogy triggers the need to provide cognitive support in virtual learning environments which in turn requires student models that create cognitive profiles of students. This study offers an innovative student modelling approach called cognitive trait model (CTM) to address both the needs mentioned above. CTM is a domain-independent and persistent student model that goes beyond traditional concept of student model. It is capable of taking the role of a learning companion who knows about the cognitive traits of the student and can supply this information when the student first starts using a new learning system. The behaviour of the students in the learning systems can then be used to update CTM. Three cognitive traits are included in the CTM in this study, they are working memory capacity, inductive reasoning ability and divergent associative learning. For the three cognitive traits, their domain-independence and persistence are studied and defined, their characteristics are examined, and behaviour patterns that can be used to indicate them are extracted. In this study, a learning system is developed to gather behaviour data of students.

This study focuses on three mutants, Wavy auricle in blade1-R (Wab 1-R), liguleless1-R (lg1-R) and milkweed pod1-R (mwp1-R) that disrupt axial patterning of maize leaves. Dominant Wab1 mutations disrupt both medial-lateral and proximal-distal patterning. Wab1 leaf blades are narrow and ectopic auricle and sheath-like tissues extend into the leaf blade. Previous analyses have shown that Lg1 acts cell-autonomously to specify ligule and auricle tissues. The current study reveals additional roles in defining leaf shape. The recessive lg1-R mutation exacerbates the Wab1-R phenotype; in the double mutants, most of the proximal blade is deleted and sheath tissue extends along the residual blade. A mosaic analysis of Wab1-R was conducted in Lg1 and lg1-R backgrounds to determine if Wab1-R affects leaf development in a cell-autonomous manner. Normal tissue identity was restored in all wab1/- sectors in a lg1-R mutant background, and in three quarters of sectors in a Lg1 background. These results suggest that Lg1 can influence the autonomy of Wab1-R. In both genotypes, leaf-halves with wab1/- sectors were significantly wider than non-sectored leaf-halves, suggesting that Wab1-R acts cell-autonomously to affect lateral growth. mwp1-R is a recessive mutation that specifically affects patterning of sheath tissue. Characterisation of the mwp1-R phenotype revealed that mwp1-R husk leaves and the sheaths of vegetative leaves develop pairs of outgrowths on the abaxial surface associated with regions of adaxialised tissue. In situ hybridisation confirmed that disruptions to adaxial-abaxial patterning are correlated with misexpression of leaf polarity genes. Leaf margins and fused organs such as the prophyll are most severely affected by mwp1-R. The first two husk leaves normally fuse along adjacent margins to form the bi-keeled prophyll. In the most severe cases the mwp1-R prophyll is reduced to an unfused, two-pronged structure and keel outgrowth is significantly reduced. We speculate that the adaxial-abaxial patterning system has been co-opted during evolution to promote outgrowth of the keels in normal prophyll development. The results of this study place Mwp1, wab1 and Lg1 in a network of genes that regulate leaf polarity and axial patterning.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corn genetics</field><field name="subject">Maize leaf growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate legal advisers of state-owned enterprises in the People's Republic of China: the developing watchdogs</field><field name="creator">Poon, Kai Cho</field><field name="description">This thesis critically assesses the design and operation of the corporate legal adviser (&#8220;CLA&#8221;) system for state-owned enterprises (&#8220;SOEs&#8221;) in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;PRC&#8221;).</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate counsel, corporate culture, corporate governance, corporate legal adviser, in-house legal service, lawyer, legal profession, risk management, SASAC, state asset, state-owned enterprise</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies towards the biomimetic total synthesis of dihydrooxepin-containing epipolythiodiketopiperazine natural products</field><field name="creator">Cebon, Benjamin Isaiah Martin</field><field name="description">SCH-64874 (5) is a fungal metabolite that inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a high-profile oncology target, with an IC50 of 1.0&#181;g/mL.

D.</field><field name="description">The revaluation of non-current assets has become an accepted accounting practice in many countries including the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. This practice has implications for the external auditor who must decide whether to accept a valuation as reasonable and how much evidence to collect to support the decision. This thesis represents the first study to examine audit decision making in this area.  Because of the absence of prior research, a series of structured interviews was undertaken with audit partners to identify the main audit issues. The results of these interviews, together with the relevant literature, were used to identify some of the factors that may impact on audit judgments concerning revalued assets. Hypotheses were developed and two complementary experiments were designed to test them. These were based on the premise that client management may be motivated to revalue in order to improve the appearance of the balance sheet, thereby increasing the inherent risk of misstatement. A 2 x 2 between-subjects design was used for both experiments, and the dependent variables measured were estimates of the planned audit hours to be spent on the revalued assets and likelihood judgments that the valuations would be accepted as reasonable.  Experiment One considered the situation where auditors are faced with two conflicting risks which are likely to exist simultaneously in the audit environment. These were the threat of litigation arising from the client's breach of a debt covenant and the risk of losing the client. The study examined auditors' responses to high and low levels of these risks on the audit of revalued owner-occupied property and an investment property. For the planned audit hours, results indicated a strong interaction effect between the two factors, with auditors planning to spend significantly more time on the audit of revalued assets when both the risk of breaching a debt covenant was high and the risk of losing the client was low. Similar results were found for the likelihood judgment that the valuations would be accepted as reasonable, except that for the investment property the results were only marginally significant.  Experiment Two examined the impact of a proposal to issue shares to the public and the competence of the independent valuer on the audit of four classes of non-current assets. Results indicated that auditors would plan to spend longer on the audit of revalued assets when the client proposed to make a share issue and also when the competence of the valuer was lower. They were also less likely to accept the valuations as reasonable in these cases. However, an interaction effect between class of asset and competence of the valuer indicated that concern with some aspects of the evidence could override subjects' sensitivity to the competence of the valuer. An additional finding was a significant experience effect for the likelihood judgments, based on the number of audits, in which subjects had been involved, that had included asset revaluations. More experienced subjects were more likely than less experienced subjects to accept the valuations as reasonable.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">audit judgment</field><field name="subject">asset revaluations</field><field name="subject">non-current assets</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Banking deregulation, banking/monetary aggregates and monetary policy</field><field name="creator">Darsono,</field><field name="description">The objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of banking and monetary aggregates as guide to the conduct of monetary policy. Banking aggregates i.e. savings mobilized through the banking system and credit aggregates are analyzed in accordance with searching altemative variables and providing more information needed to facilitate monetary policy.This study found that the possible presence of stmctural breaks for banking and monetary aggregates occurred in response to the second phase of banking deregulation.  With regard to the long mn relationships, this study confirmed the existence of stable long run equilibrium for all banking and monetary aggregates. However, for interest bearing aggregates i.e. savings, credit, modified narrow money and broad money, the stable equilibrium could only be achieved when applying the test procedures which allow for the presence of possible stmctural breaks. It implies that banking deregulation had more impact on interest bearing aggregates than on non interest ones. The latter, particularly currency and narrow money, are needed mainly to support fransactions, therefore they are less responsive to changes in interest rates which under a deregulated system were allowed to reach their market clearing levels.The short run relationships particularly with respect to changes in interest rates display an interesting result. Even though interest rates were statistically significant in explaining the short mn variations of some interest bearing aggregates, however their magnitudes were considered too low to warrant a policy recommendation. In line with savings mobilization which has received considerable attention in the banking deregulation, since interest rates were not effective enough as a measure to stimulate savings, the policy should be more focused on building and maintaining public confidence in the domestic banks. With regard to the implementation of monetary policy, it suggests that indirect monetary instmments which work through affecting the price i.e. interest rates were not effective. Clearly, under a deregulated system, banking and monetary aggregates are less controllable.Banking and monetary aggregates mostly did not perform well in predicting the future course of variables regarded to be the objectives of monetary policy particularly inflation and real income. Nominal currency performs more consistently and statistically significant in explaining the future course of inflation, both in the full sample and sub sample period. Meanwhile none of the banking and monetary aggregates could perform well in explaining real income, particularly in the post banking deregulation sub sample period.Briefly, in the long run banking and monetary aggregates are mostly still reliable as a guide to undertaking monetary policy in Indonesia, provided that stable long run equilibrium for those aggregates and the specified variables still exist regardless of the impact of banking deregulation. However, in terms of relationship with the variables presumed to be the objectives of monetary policy or predictabihty and controllability aspects, currency and narrow money and modified narrow money emerge as the most sensible variables to guide for the conduct of monetary policy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water and wastewater systems sustainability in remote Australia</field><field name="creator">Werner, Melanie</field><field name="description">This research examines the sustainability of small water and wastewater systems for remote settlements in Central Australia, and develops a multi-criteria assessment framework to compare the performance of technologies for use in such systems. The sustainability of water and wastewater systems has been the subject of considerable research, for both centralised and decentralised systems in developed and developing countries. The use of Multi Criteria Assessment (MCA) to solve sustainability-oriented water and wastewater problems has also been the subject of prior research in a variety of settings. Both these fields have emphasised the need for locally determined definitions of sustainability and MCA processes which reflect the reality of the stakeholders who will be influenced by project outcomes. Such research has only been carried out to a limited extent in relation to the small, self-managed water and wastewater systems which are typical of remote settlements in Central Australia. The work undertaken as part of this project aims to fill that gap.The research had two aims. The first was to develop a picture of water and wastewater systems sustainability that was relevant and applicable to remote Central Australian settings. The second was to use that vision of sustainable systems to design a multicriteria assessment framework which could be used to compare and evaluate water and wastewater treatment technologies for use in those settings.Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to achieve these aims. Firstly, a qualitative pre-scoping study was carried out to gain an understanding of the conditions and settings at remote Central Australian sites. This involved site visits and discussions with the person responsible for the water system at each site. The outcomes informed the full scoping study into systems sustainability, in which interviews and focus groups with experts and different types of users in Central Australia were undertaken to discuss systems, technologies and the issues faced in water and wastewater provision. Analysis of these results led to the development of the overall sustainability framework for water and wastewater systems. Further analysis relating to what respondents were saying specifically about technologies contributed to the development of the sustainability oriented multi-criteria assessment process for assessment of technologies.A telephone survey of users was then carried out to determine the weightings for different criteria in the MCA process. Technology manufacturers were also surveyed to obtain data on technology performance against the criteria, which was then input to the analysis. Different weighting and scoring methods were used to examine the sensitivity of the model and the analysis itself was carried out in Microsoft Excel.It was found that systems sustainability is made up of five dimensions for remote settlements in Central Australia &#8211; economic, social, environmental, technical and institutional. Principles, criteria and indicators of sustainability were developed for each of these dimensions. The MCA framework consisted of 13 criteria relating to the economic, social, environmental, technical &amp; institutional performance of technologies.The commercially available technologies considered for water purification were all small reverse osmosis units with a permeate production capacity of up to 2,000L/day. The reason these units were chosen is that the primary reliable source of water for most sites in remote locations is groundwater, and salinity of groundwater often represents a barrier to its use as a potable source.The technologies assessed for wastewater treatment are all commercially available units designed for sites not connected to a centralised sewerage system. They represent a range of treatment methods, namely aerobic treatment, membrane bioreactors and packed bed treatment. Chlorination and ultraviolet tertiary treatment options are considered in combination with these where they were available as part of the unit.The assessment of water technologies found two units which out-performed the others. The results varied depending on the weighting and scoring method used, and there were some differences between user groups. The assessment of wastewater technologies showed that one unit was the best performer across every combination of weighting and scoring bar one. Areas in which further technology development should be undertaken for improved performance have included modularity of technologies; robustness in harsh conditions; simplicity of operation and maintenance and regulatory compliance.The sustainability model developed for water and wastewater treatment in remote settings could be used to: &#8226;	Assess the sustainability of existing water and wastewater systems, by examining their performance against the indicators &#8226;	Assist in planning new systems to ensure that they will be sustainable, by making sure that steps are in place to fulfil each of the indicators &#8226;	Examine policy or funding decisions related to service provision which may impact on any of the criteria or indicators either positively or negatively.The multi-criteria assessment framework can be used to compare technologies and assess relative sustainability performance. The adoption and use of these two tools should lead to more sustainable water and wastewater systems for remote Central Australian sites in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postorientalism: orientalism since orientalism</field><field name="creator">Degabriele, Maria</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines a range of popular contemporary texts in a post-Saidian context. It begins with an analysis of Orientalism, as that text influences almost any discussion of representations of Easmest relations. Now, almost twenty years after Orientalism was first published in 1978 it is still a crucial text, and it still needs to be understood and argued with. The other texts looked at in this dissertation include novels, drama, films, opera, a musical, and the print and electronic mass media. They are texts that either represent or comment on EastIWest relations. The main texts I examine fall roughly into two categories: ones that are clearly orientalist and ones that are postorientalist. Those that are orientalist repeat the same myths of Orient Said describes in Orientalism. Those that are postorientalist challenge those myths by repeating and elaborating them, reversing and displacing the orientalist gaze.
 
 The methodological approach is an eclectic blend of cultural studies and literary criticism. Such an approach enables analysis of a variety of texts, fiom classical nineteenth century books and myths through to contemporary postmodern representations, that deal with identity politics.
 
 My thesis is that contemporary postcolonial representations that deal with East and West and that use and displace the very terms such categories rest upon, can be called postoriental.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/20/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting on continuity and discontinuity in the law: an application of Foucault's archaeological method in a reading of judicial decisions in negligence</field><field name="creator">Dent, Christopher Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis is a tentative application of Foucault's archaeological method to the English common law. The project is an attempt at explaining and demonstrating the specific attributes of the method in terms of a contribution to an understanding of the law as both continuous and discontinuous.
 
 From the understanding applied in this thesis, an application of the archaeological method requires a careful examination of the monuments of a discourse. The monuments that are examined in this project are a number of negligence law judgments. The authors of the monuments are seen as the sum of the practices that constitute them. That is, in this application of the method to the law, the judges are not considered as authors, instead, the judgments they write are seen as reflecting the practices of the legal discourse.
 
 The most fundamental of these discursive practices, from the perspective applied in this thesis is the repetition of past legal statements in the production of judgments. In the understanding of law adopted in this project, cases are treated as sites within which judges choose from a number of possible legal statements made by preceding judges. The common law, then, is seen as representing a process in which statements by particular judges in specific cases are valorised, primarily through repetition, until the alternative utterances are largely, but never completely, excluded.
 
 The application of the archaeological method to these negligence decisions demonstrates the operation of the discursive practice of repetition. The application provides a framework for appreciating the way in which the law can change without losing its continuity and legitimacy. The project examines cases between 1750 and 1972 and demonstrates that, despite apparently radical changes in the articulations of liability, from the writ system to the duty of care, the law has maintained its structure through the reproduction of the discursive practices that constitute members of the legal profession.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/21/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cleanup of the Buriganga River: integrating the environment into decision making</field><field name="creator">Alam, MD Khorshed</field><field name="description">This research attempts to fill in some specific gaps in the area of economic valuation of non-market goods and services with respect to development projects, and the integration of those values in the policy decision-making process. The concept and theory of non-market valuation and project appraisal are examined. In a developing country context, the conventional contingent valuation method is extended to include respondents' contribution in terms of time, irrespective of their decision to contribute money. This extension of the conventional contingent valuation method allows the inclusion of economic activities that are non-monetized and transactions in the form of 'barter exchange', which are typical for developing countries such as Bangladesh. The values generated by this new approach are integrated into an extended cost-benefit analysis, which reveals that the cleanup of dying rivers is not only an environmental imperative, but is also socially and economically justifiable. Apart from the theoretical investigation, another important dimension of this research is to contribute to the policy decision-making process with regard to public sector investment in developing countries.
 
 The Buriganga River, which passes through Dhaka City, the capital of Bangladesh, has been selected as the case study for this research. Although considered to be the lifeline of the capital, the city part of the Buriganga River has become biologically and hydrologically dead because of the indiscriminate dumping of domestic and industrial wastes, encroachment by unscrupulous people, and negligence on the part of the authority to enforce rules and regulations pertaining to the ecological health of the river.
 
 A cleanup programme has been designed for the Buriganga River to restore its water quality and develop new facilities in and around the river. This hypothetical cleanup programme is used: (i) to estimate the non-market benefits of an environmentally healthy waterway; (ii) to measure the total benefits; and (iii) to examine the desirability of public funding for the cleanup programme. An extended contingent valuation (ECV) survey of 400 households was carried out in Dhaka City in 2001. It reveals that not only are a significant proportion of the respondents willing to contribute direct cash for the environmental improvement of the river, they are also willing to contribute their time. When the contribution in terms of time is monetized, it is estimated to represent about 60 percent of the total contribution (the remaining 40 percent being cash payment).
 
 The total non-market benefits from the Buriganga River cleanup programme are estimated at Tk 388 million (US$ 6.80 million) in the first year, rising to Tk 1805 million (US$ 31.66 million) by the 10th year of the programme. The public decision making process in Bangladesh does not consider such benefits. Failures to do so lead to gross under-estimation of the potential for, and contribution of, undertaking environmental improvement activities.
 
 The total benefits of the cleanup programme are estimated within the framework of total economic value: the non-market benefits are estimated using the ECV survey inputs, and the market benefits are measured using secondary information, market methods and a benefit transfer approach. The cost estimate of the cleanup programme is made using market and secondary information with appropriate adjustments. The extended cost-benefit analysis (ECBA), which integrates the non-market benefits of the cleanup programme, shows that such public funding is worth undertaking. The study also reveals that a significant portion (68 percent) of this investable funding can be generated from the community.
 
 The need for a cleanup programme of the Buriganga River is not an isolated case in Bangladesh. Many rivers in that country, and also throughout the developed and developing world are under threat of becoming biologically and hydrologically dead. This study provides a framework for addressing such environmental problems. It demonstrates that the ECV survey is a useful tool in estimating economic values of resources even in extremely poor economies. The modification of the contingent valuation method takes into account the local context, including cultural, economic, social and political settings. The extended cost-benefit analysis, which integrates better resource values could provide important information for the policy decision-making process. This is particularly useful for countries where the democratic system is not fully developed and there is limited experience in integrating the environment into the decision making.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/22/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education in and for democracy and human rights: moving from Utopian ideals to grounded practices</field><field name="creator">Dobozy, Eva</field><field name="description">This thesis is set in the Western Australian education system and centres on the question of how primary schools can actively foster conditions conducive to creating and sustaining education in and for democracy and human rights. In Australia, as elsewhere, there is a widespread acceptance of the need for democratic education also referred to as civics and citizenship education. The perceived lack of public understanding of democratic principles and practices has, in the last decade, led various Australian governments to commit significant resources ($ 31.6 million) to civics and citizenship education programmes such as Discovering Democracy (DD).
 
 This thesis argues that political engagement and civic learning is most effective when schools commit themselves to deliberately embedding a set of democratic educational principles in everyday practices. In contrast to traditional approaches to citizenship education that tend to focus on the operational aspects of representative governments, institutions and history, this thesis argues that education for Democracy and Human Rights (DaHR) can be effectively achieved through the fostering of DaHR in education. In this task the thesis draws on the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The CRC is rooted in a range of basic values about the treatment of children in schools and elsewhere, and encompasses basic rights to which children are entitled.
 
 The study empirically investigates through up close observations, interviews and surveys the efficacy of pedagogy for civic and citizenship learning in four schools identified as places of strong democratic practice. This study was able to identify particular commonalities between the four case study schools that were conducive to creating and sustaining democratic principles and practices. These schools, although very different in their composition, were lead by principals who shared the view that children under their care were subjects in the making with increasing rights and responsibilities rather than objects to be manipulated, controlled and protected. The findings suggest that experiencing democracy and human rights in daily school life in a variety of situations and on a number of different levels can effectively contribute to the learning of the meaning and advantages of democratic values such as the rule of law, participatory decision-making and due process. It also concludes that there may be a relationship between parental socio-economic background and the possibilities available for students to engage in effective civic learning and citizenship practices. The relationship between socio-economic background and other structural factors including gender and ethnicity in relation to possibilities of civic learning needs to be investigated in a larger study.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/23/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Positively promising: women's decision making pregnancy and health promotion</field><field name="creator">Dodd, Jennifer</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the ways in which health promotion campaigns presuppose the pregnant subject and how main stream health promoters construct theories and practices of empowerment, health literacy and rationality.
 
 Two Western Australian main stream health promotion campaigns directed at pregnant women in the period 1996 to 1997 (the time of interviewing) and still current at time of writing, will be analysed and comparisons made with the development of health promotion theory and practice generally. The normalisation of medicallscientific approaches toward pregnancy care and behaviour will be illustrated by providing examples from health promotion literature, medical and health journals, popular pregnancy books, magazines and newspaper stories. The assumption that health literacy is the major attribute necessary to enable empowerment is intenogated and the limitations of this perspective illustrated.
 
 The second part of the thesis deals more directly with the interview material and illustrates how the women interviewed related to, and engaged with, main stream health information. The diversity with the group of middle class women interviewed is highlighted, and the different philosophical positions they occupy in relation to main stream health information explored. The complexity and contextual situatedness of women's decision making in relation to notions about health literacy, rationality and empowerment is outlined. The concluding chapters of the thesis discuss the most recent developments in main stream health promtion theory, examining the limitations of social capital theory, social marketing and other health promotion strategies. The conclusion imagines the possible benefits for women as health subjects and main stream health promoters as experts, in rethinking rationality and re-supposing women as positive health subjects that are promising rather than permanently risky and in need of improvement.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/24/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selection for faster growing black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri</field><field name="creator">Doupe, Robert Gerard</field><field name="description">In Australia, the widespread clearing of native vegetation has resulted in large areas of once-productive agricultural land being affected by rising saline groundwaters. There is considerable interest among farmers and rural landowners throughout Western Australia, in the possibilities that inland saline aquaculture may offer for a potentially productive use of land and water resources that can no longer support traditional agriculture. Black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) appear to be an ideal candidate for the developing saline aquaculture industry of inland Western Australia, however their current maximum growth rates are too slow for profitable production. The high productivity of modern breeds of terrestrial livestock species is primarily due to genetic improvement programs utilising selective breeding, and similar gains have also been made where they have been implemented for aquatic species. Before the growth rate of black bream can be genetically improved, however, it is necessary to estimate both the extent of genetic improvement required and the extent of genetic (co)variation in those growth traits which will be subject to, or affected by, selection. The aims of this study were to:
 
 (1) Determine the extent of genetic improvement in growth rate required for black bream to be considered as a profitable aquaculture species.
 (2) Estimate the potential for growth rate to be improved through heterosis when different black bream strains are crossbred.
 (3) Estimate the additive genetic variation for growth rate, which exists within populations of black bream.
 (4) Estimate the genetic (co)variation which exists between growth rate and other production traits.
 
 A partial budget analysis investigated whether enhanced growth rates of black bream would improve profitability and justify a genetic improvement program. It was conducted for two different fish production systems; a commercial operation that incurred more operating expenses due to costs associated with farm initiation (stand-alone farm model) and an existing farm that diversified into aquaculture using the saline water resources of established farm dams (integrated farm model). Sensitivity analyses indicated that a 33% increase in growth rate to at least 200g/annum would allow either production system to return a profit at a farm-gate price of AUS$6/kg whole fish, with fish survival rates of 98% for the stand-alone farm and 65% for the integrated farm model. These results provided a breeding objective, being an improvement in growth rate by at least 33%.
 
 A complete diallel cross of two black bream populations was used to estimate the comparative advantages that might be gained from straight-breeding and crossbreeding. At 90 days of age, the growth traits of standard length, total length and wet weight, varied significantly among all straight-bred and crossbred lines, and among half-sib groups within lines. Differences among half-sib groups explained 6.8% of the total variance in standard length, 8.3% in total length and 7.1% in wet weight, giving estimated heritabilities over all lines of 0.27 plus-minus 0.11 for standard length, 0.33 plus-minus 0.13 for total length and 0.28 plus-minus 0.12 for wet weight. There was no evidence for heterosis in any traits when straight-bred and crossbred lines were compared, and phenotypic (rP = 0.95 - 0.98) and genetic (rG = 0.63 - 0.69) correlations were high among all growth traits.
 
 I used the estimated heritability for wet weight of 0.28 to optimise a factorial mating design from a single population, and to estimate the contribution of additive genetic, nonadditive genetic and maternal effects to variation in growth traits of black bream at 75, 130 and 180 days of age in the hatchery. Maternal genetic and environmental effects were greatest at 75 days of age, accounting for 9.1% of total phenotypic variance in wet weight, 11.4% of variance in standard length and 8.8% of variance in total length. At later ages maternal effects were much reduced, explaining 0.8 - 3.7% of phenotypic variance in growth traits. Additive genetic effects were greatest at 130 days of age, when they accounted for 17.4% of total phenotypic variance in wet weight, 21.4% of variance in standard length and 18.7% of variance in total length. Additive genetic effects were negligible (&lt;1%) at 75 days of age and 4.8 - 5.5% of total phenotypic variance in growth traits at 180 days of age. Non-additive genetic effects (which also included common environmental effects due to families being raised in the same tank) explained 5.8 - 7.3% of total phenotypic variance in growth traits at 75 days of age, but were much smaller at later ages. Variable stocking densities among tanks up to 75 days significantly affected all growth trait measurements below 180 days of age.
 
 One of the most important of these traits is feed conversion efficiency. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) is the effectiveness with which feed is converted to saleable fish product. Feed costs are a major input to aquaculture production systems and genetic changes in FCE may therefore have an important influence on profitability. FCE is usually expressed by a composite measure that combines feed intake and growth rate. The two most common measures are feed conversion ratio (feed intake/weight gain over a specified time interval) and its inverse, feed efficiency. Feed conversion ratio and feed efficiency are measures of gross FCE, because they do not distinguish between the separate energy requirements of growth and maintenance. There is abundant evidence of substantial genetic variation in FCE and its component traits in terrestrial livestock species and, although data are few, the same is likely for cultured fish species. The major problems with selecting from this variation to genetically improve FCE in fish species are:
 
 * It appears impractical to measure feed intake on individual fish, so that family mean data must be used.
 * We do not know the optimal time period over which to test fish for FCE.
 * We do not know the genetic correlations between FCE under apparent satiation or restricted intake conditions, or between FCE at different times in the production cycle.
 
 I measured the relationships between feed intake to apparent satiety and weight gain in replicate half-sib families of black bream at four times over a 56-day test period. After 42 days, I found significant additive genetic variance in both weight gain and feed intake, and a stabilisation in family group variation in both traits. This indicates that 42 days is the minimum test period over which to measure genetic variation for FCE in black bream. There were high, positive phenotypic (and probably genetic) correlations between weight gain and feed intake after 42 days. There was no detectable genetic variation for either feed efficiency (weight gain/feed intake), or residual feed intake, which is the difference between the actual feed intake of an individual and the intake predicted from its body weight and growth rate. I argue that selection for improved FCE might be better achieved not by using a composite measure, but by using a weighted selection index that accounts for the genetic covariance among weight gain, feed intake and other correlated traits.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/25/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An environmentally based approach to tourism planning</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Ross Kingston</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the evolving relationship between the environment and tourism and argues for a new environmentally based regional tourism planning approach.  In environmental planning the major aim is to foster environmental protection and conservation, whereas the goals of tourism planning are to engender tourism promotion and area development.  This study seeks to determine whether or not the two approaches can be combined to institute both environmental conservation and tourism development, that is to bring about sustainable tourism development.  It is argued that the two can be integrated through a traditional tourism planning approach underpinned by environmental planning methods.  The research then proposes a new environmentally based tourism planning model which is tested in Western Australia.  
 
 The evolution of the environment - tourism relationship is traced over the last four decades.  The advent of mass tourism since World War 11 is related to growing global environmental awareness.  Two aspects of the environment - tourism relationship are identified and described.  The first is that the environment and tourism have symbiotic and even synergistic possibilities in which the relationship is mutually beneficial.  The second is that they are in conflict and that tourism is destroying its very foundations.  The conclusion is drawn that elements of both symbiosis and conflict are ever present in the environment - tourism relationship.  Therefore, it is suggested that the symbiotic or ideal view be tempered by the realistic acceptance of tourism and the environment's potential and actual conflicts. This in itself leads to an integrative approach which minimizes adverse impacts and enhances positive outcomes through integrated planning and management. 
 
 Having established the integrative link between tourism and the environment, tourism and area development planning models are then briefly reviewed as well as those applicable to environmental conservation and protection planning.  Parallels are drawn between the two planning approaches especially in relation to social and spatial components.  It is then argued that the future of environment - tourism planning is based on environmental conservation, the incorporation of community and tourist views and the recognition of functional differentiation.  It is asserted that the planning of natural areas for tourism should begin from an environmental base and work forwards towards the identification of tourism opportunities; include the views of community groups and tourists, especially in regard to the environment - tourism relationship; and conclude with a plan which embraces the spatial features of both environmental and tourism nodes, corridors and hinterlands.  
 
 A new regional sustainable development framework called Environmentally Based Tourism (EBT) Planning Model is described.  It is grounded in environmental conservation and seeks to advance environmentally compatible tourism through the identification of significant features, critical areas and compatible activities. Although incorporating aspects of the rational approach to planning, the role of people as part of the ecosystem is emphasized, and part of the process.  Zoning is used to maintain environmental and tourism values and includes the following zones:  sanctuary, nature conservation, outdoor recreation and tourism destination.  
 
 This thesis is explored on two levels; by the generation of the environmentally based tourism planning model and then through its application to a regional case study in Western Australia (WA). The medal was tested in the Gascoyne Region of WA from 1989-1991. Extant environmental and tourism data were combined with face-to-face surveys of residents and tourists.  Following analysis, the central conclusion is that the model is a useful tool in integrating environmental and tourism goals.  Limitations of the study include the contextual integration of environmental and social values, the lack of comprehensive environmental data, and the attempt to bring together disparate planning approaches.  However, overall the model helps bridge the rational values orientated planning gap and assists in the identification of environment - tourism planning parameters.  Finally, further research opportunities are identified especially in relation to the selection of appropriate data.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/26/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifecycle, biology and diversity of Puccinia boroniae in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Driessen, Susanna</field><field name="description">The rust fungi (Uredinales, Basidiomycota) are an expansive and diverse group of fungal species, consisting of approximately 7000 different species in over 160 different genera. Fungi of the genus Puccinia represent a large proportion of these rust fungi, many species of which are well known for their role in causing massive yield and subsequent economic losses in agricultural crops worldwide. Puccinia boroniae is one such rust fungus and is a significant pathogen of several species of Boronia (Rutaceae), a native Australian wildflower grown commercially in Western Australia as a cutflower. Complete control of the rust pathogen is rarely achieved using chemical fungicides. Improving the level of disease control is vital for the long-term sustainability and future growth of the Boronia industry, and requires an understanding of the pathogen. The objectives of this thesis were to investigate aspects of the epidemiology, the biology and the diversity of P. boroniae in Western Australia, providing a broad understanding of the pathogen, which in turn could be employed to improve disease control.
 
 The lifecycle of P. boroniae was conclusively shown to be microcyclic by artificial inoculation of Boronia heterophylla with basidiospores released from germinating teliospores suspended over the host plant. Telia developed on the leaves within 21 days, with no intermediate rust spore stages (pycnial, uredial or aecial) observed. Rarely, low numbers of pycnia of P. boroniae were observed on field specimens collected from leaves of B. megastigma cultivated at one commercial floriculture plantation. This was the first record of pycnia of P. boroniae; however, as pycnia were not observed on other host species or plantations, or formed during controlled inoculation trials, their functional role in the lifecycle is currently unresolved. 
 
 Telia were subepidermal, erumpent and pulvinate, amphigenous on leaves, stems and parts of developing flower buds, and generally persistent year round. Intracellular hyphae resembling monokaryotic haustoria (M-haustoria) were observed in leaf mesophyll cells beneath and adjacent of telia. Occasionally Sphaerellopsis filum (teleomorph Eudarluca caricis), a known mycoparasite of rust fungi, was observed on the telia. Under favourable conditions, teliospores germinated immediately without a period of dormancy, with fully mature basidiospores formed within 3-4 h after telia were exposed to moisture. Basidial development in P. boroniae was unusual, in that only one basidiospore was formed from each germinating teliospore cell. Immature teliospores were initially binucleate undergoing karyogamy to form a single large (presumably diploid) nucleus that migrated into the developing metabasidium. Both binucleate and tetranucleate metabasidia were observed, with mature uninucleate, binucleate and tetranucleate basidiospores present. At this stage, more research is required to understand the complete nuclear behaviour during teliospore germination. The morphology of the pycnial stage was similar to other Puccinia species, being ampulliform, subepidermal, amphigenous and arranged in small clusters on leaves of B. megastigma. However, the spine-like periphyses protruded through stomata as apposed to penetrating the leaf epidermis. 
 
 Environmental conditions favouring the formation and dispersal of basidiospores were assessed in vitro and under field conditions with a spore catcher. Under field conditions, basidiospores were captured from February-August 2004, with peak numbers and daily incidence occurring during autumn (April/May) when the average temperature range was 9.1-22.6 degrees C. Daily basidiospore numbers were positively correlated with minimum daily temperature and total daily rainfall. A distinct diurnal periodicity of release was observed, with numbers peaking on average between 02:00 and 05:00 hrs. The hourly release of basidiospores was positively correlated with relative humidity and negatively correlated with temperature and evaporation. This data was in agreement with the in vitro experimentation, which showed that basidiospore formation occurred between 10-25 plus-minus 1 degrees C (apparent optimal temperature of 15-20 plus-minus 1 degrees C) with telia incubated in continuous darkness promoting a greater number of basidiospores. 
 
 The level of genetic variation of P. boroniae in Western Australia was assessed by PCR-RFLP of the nuclear ribosomal intergenic spacer 2 (IGS2) region. Two RFLP profiles were observed, separating three specimens (Group 1) from the remaining population (Group 2). Sequence analysis indicated that point mutations at endonuclease recognition sites were responsible for the changes in RFLP profile. Group 2 specimens had been collected from the same host species (B. megastigma) and plantation, and it is suggested that the variant specimens may constitute a subspecies of P. boroniae, isolated by geographic location and possibly host (cultivar) specificity. Further analysis, primarily pathogenicity trials, is needed to confirm this.
 
 This study has improved our knowledge regarding the rust fungus P. boroniae and has laid strong foundations for future research into several aspects of the biology, epidemiology and population variation. The implications of the key findings of this research, with an emphasis on the management of P. boroniae in commercial situations, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/27/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on polymorphic alu insertions and genomic diversity within the major histocompatibility complex</field><field name="creator">Dunn, David Suliman</field><field name="description">After the initiation of the human genome sequencing project and the introduction of the field of 'bioinformatics', interest in human genetic diversity studies has been increased. Sequence diversity has helped define differences between genes and genomic regions that were previously unknown or difficult to determine. In this thesis I have undertaken to study sequence diversity in the human genome in three areas; 1) investigated diversity in the MHC as represented by the MICA alleles with respect to the known HLA alleles, 2) investigated the structure and diversity in the intergenic region from an MHC related (paralogous) genomic region and related the structural and diversity findings to the knowledge available on the MHC and the wider genome, and 3) described the identification of three and characterization of five new MHC class I polymorphic markers (Alu) and their polymorphic characteristics in worldwide populations and their associations with skin cancer.
 
 1. Phylogenetic analysis of MICA alpha-domain (extracellular) sequences demonstrated relationships with HLA-B cross-reactive serogroups. The HLA-B and MICA loci are in linkage disequilibrium. The data indicated that MICA and HLA-B have evolved in concert from their common ancestors and that the transmembrane polymorphisms have arisen independently and more recently.
 
 2. Sequence analysis of the CD1 genomic region confirmed the presence of five CD1 genes and revealed that there are four unrelated intergenic regions (IGRs). The IGRs are composed mostly of retroelements including five full-length L1 PA sequences and various pseudogenes. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses support the view that the human CD1 gene copies were duplicated prior to the evolution of primates and the bulk of the HLA class I genes found in humans.
 
 3. Five polymorphic Alu insertions (POALINs) were identified (two from previous studies) and located within the 1.8 megabase of the MHC class I genomic region. All five POALINs are polymorphic, and are positively associated with the HLA-A and HLA-B alleles. The AluyHJ insertion was found most frequently associated with HLA-A1 or A24, AluyHG with HLA-A2, AluyHF with HLA-A2, A-10 or -A26 and AluyTF showed a marginal association with HLA-A29. The AluyMICB insertion was strongly associated with HLA-B17 (HLA-B57, HLA-B58) and HLA-B13. The presence of three Alu insertions (AluyHJ, AluyHG and AluyHF) was found in only one HLA class I haplotype (HLA-A1, -B57, -Cw6) in the 10th IHW cell lines. A novel positive association between the presence of AluyMICB and the 'MICAdel/MICBnull/HLA-B48' haplotype was determined. The AluyMICB insertion was also associated with at least three different MICB alleles (*0102, *0107N and *0105) and three different HLA-B alleles (B13, B48 and B57). Based on the analysis of associations between different polymorphic markers within the beta block, the MICB*0102 allele was inferred to be the ancestral form of the MICB*0105 and MICB*0107N alleles. The AluyMICB polymorphism can be used to further investigate haplotype relationship and consequently their lineage origins. Some of the MHC POALINs are haplospecific and associate strongly with certain groups of HLA class I alleles and MHC ancestral haplotypes. The AluyTF frequency was significantly associated with skin cancer (p&lt;0.005). 
 
 MICA gene diversity is derived from two different evolving paths, therefore one or the other alone cannot reliably mark an ancestral haplotype. The CD1 duplicons originated well before the HLA class I duplicons. The MHC POALINs provide new lineage and linkage markers for the fine mapping study of different haplotypes and variations in linkage groups across 1.8 Mb of the MHC class I region. The POALINs may also prove useful in investigating the origins and history of human populations and in determining the role of human genetic diversity in disease risk.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/28/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parasites of feral cats and native fauna from Western Australia: the application of molecular techniques for the study of parasitic infections in Australian wildlife</field><field name="creator">Adams, Peter John</field><field name="description">A survey of gastro-intestinal parasites was conducted on faecal samples collected from 379 feral cats and 851 native fauna from 16 locations throughout Western Australia. The prevalence of each parasite species detected varied depending upon the sampling location. Common helminth parasites detected in feral cats included Ancylostoma spp. (29.8%), Oncicola pomatostomi (25.6%), Spirometra erinaceieuropaei (14%), Taenia taeniaeformis (4.7%), Physaloptera praeputialis (3.7%) and Toxocara cati (2.6%). The most common protozoan parasites detected in feral cats were Isospora rivolta (16.9%) and I. felis (4.5%). The native mammals were predominately infected with unidentified nematodes of the order Strongylida (59.1%), with members of the orders Rhabditida, Spirurida and Oxyurida also common. Oxyuroid nematodes were most common in the rodents (47.9%) and western grey kangaroos (27.8%). Several species of Eimeria were detected in the marsupials whilst unidentified species of Entamoeba and coccidia were common in most of the native fauna.
 
 Primers anchored in the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were used to develop a polymerase chain reaction-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique to differentiate the species of Ancylostoma detected in feral cats. Amplification of the ITS+ region (ITS1, ITS2 and 5.8S gene) followed by digestion with the endonuclease RsaI produced characteristic patterns for A. tubaeforme, A. ceylanicum and A. caninum, which were detected in 26.6%, 4.7% and 0% of feral cats respectively. Giardia was detected in a cat, dingo, quenda and two native rodents. Sequence analysis at the small subunit rDNA gene (SSU-rDNA) identified the cat and dingo as harbouring G.duodenalis infections belonging to the genetic assemblages A and D respectively.
 
 Subsequent analysis of the SSU-rDNA and elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1[alpha]) identified a novel species of Giardia occurring in the quenda. Attempts to genetically characterise the Giardia in the two native rodents were unsuccessful.
 
 Serological detection of Toxoplasma gondii was compared to a one tube hemi-nested PCR protocol to evaluate its sensitivity. PCR was comparable to serology in detecting T. gondii infections, although PCR was a much more definitive and robust technique than serology for large numbers of samples. Amplification of T. gondii DNA detected infections in 4.9% of feral cats and 6.5% of native mammals. The distribution of T. gondii does not appear to be restricted by environmental factors, which implies that vertical transmission is important for the persistence of T. gondii infections in Western Australia.
 
 These results demonstrate that cats carry a wide range of parasitic organisms, many of which may influence the survival and reproduction of native mammals. As such, the large-scale conservation and reintroduction of native fauna in Western Australia must not disregard the potential influence parasites can have on these populations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/29/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dealing with curriculum change: how teachers perceive recent curriculum changes and the strategies they employ to cope with such change</field><field name="creator">Cresdee, Michelle</field><field name="description">The current study attempted to identify conditions that affect the manner in which Western Australian primary school teachers perceive recent curriculum changes; the types of support they access; and the relative usefulness of this support. Based on preliminary findings in the first phase of this study and the research literature it was expected that teacher self-efficacy, teacher characteristics such as age and years of teaching, and school context such as the level of 'innovativeness' would prove to be influential in the process of implementing new initiatives. A model expressing the relationships between these concepts was developed and evaluated in the second phase of this study. This study is important for two reasons. It focused on Western Australian primary school teachers, whereas most previous research focused on high school teachers, and it explored ways to help teachers deal with future changes instead of simply identifying their responses to changes. It is therefore hoped that the education system will be more informed and better able to provide appropriate support for teachers when faced with future reforms.
 
 The study was conducted in two parts. The purpose of phase one was to become familiar with the current circumstances of teachers in relation to curriculum change. By focusing on the attitudes and behaviours of teachers from 'innovative' schools it was thought more could be learned than in schools that maintain the status quo. Qualitative methods of semi-structured interviews, informal observations and the analysis of websites and school documents were utilised throughout this phase. The second phase of the study employed a quantitative approach, based on the findings of the first phase, specifically a process of questionnaire construction and distribution throughout the defined population.
 
 A number of cautious conclusions have been made within the limits of this study. Firstly, the most useful type of professional development for teachers involves teachers interacting with each other. Teachers need time to discuss issues and share their successes. However, Action Research as a means of professional development is currently under utilised. It was discovered that most teachers were positive towards curriculum change, yet an overwhelming workload has proved a formidable barrier to new initiatives. In addition, most teachers will modify initiatives to meet the needs of their students and to fit in with their existing orientations. Consequently, school structures need to become more flexible to encourage teachers to engage in innovative practices. Interestingly, the self-efficacy of a teacher influences the way they perceive and cope with curriculum change, however teacher characteristics, such as age and the number of years teaching, did not yield substantially different results when teachers were categorised along these dimensions. School context, as defined by the level of 'innovativeness', did produce differential results in terms of teacher attitudes and responses to curriculum change, and the type of professional development accessed. Finally, schools may need to involve parents and the wider school community in the school level decision-making processes if they truly are to become ' learning communities'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/30/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual development and the public educative care of children: a critical evaluation of biblical and dynamic systems perspectives</field><field name="creator">Cupit, Christopher Glenn</field><field name="description">A useful model of spiritual development in the public educative care of children must: specify the meaning and nature of spirituality; clarify its relationship to an underlying ontology; identify in what sense spirituality is developmental; be consistent with a justifiable paradigm of human development; explain the role and status of such spiritual development with a secular system of educative care; and specify practical implications flowing from these matters.
 
 Using narrative criticism within an evangelical framework, the biblical descriptions of spirituality and childhood were critically examined as a basis for such a model. Biblical spirituality was developmental and was identified with encounters, usually naturally mediated, between human spirits and God's Spirit, and spirits which alienate from God's Spirit. All children, without qualification of belief, community, rite or age, were identified as spirits who share a special relationship with God's Spirit both ontologically and experientially. Biblical childhood was not defined chronologically but functionally by inability to take responsibility for one's own spiritual life because of openness to God's and other spirits.
 
 Principles of 'magician systems' in Dynamic Systems Theory parallel phenomena of human development and those commonly designated as spiritual. Consequently, a dynamic model of spiritual development is proposed which is consonant with biblical teaching and grounded in an established scientific paradigm. This indicates that spirituality is an inescapable aspect of any educative care setting or system and need not be introduced as though children lack it. Spiritually salient aspects of educative care will lead children to spiritual encounters which are derivative of a positive life affirming principle or fundamentally destructive and alienating. These aspects encompass the spiritual ontology of the setting, the children, the personnel, the physical environment, the nature and quality of relationships, the curriculum, religious activities, the nurture provided, and the wider context, all of which are of spiritual moment.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/31/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">With an olive branch and a shillelagh: the political career of Senator Paddy Lynch (1867-1944)</field><field name="creator">Cusack, Danny</field><field name="description">As a loyal Empire man and ardent conscriptionist, Irish born Senator Paddy Lynch swam against the prevailing Irish Catholic Labor political current. He was one of those MP's who followed Prime Minister W.M. Hughes out of the Federal Labor caucus in November 1916, serving out the rest of his political career in the Nationalist ranks. On the face of things, he represents something of a contradiction.
 
 A close examination of Lynch's youth in Ireland, his early years in Australia and his subsequent parliamentary career helps us to resolve this apparent paradox. It also enables us to build up a picture of Lynch the man and to explain his political odyssey. He emerges as representative of that early generation of conservative Laborites (notably J.C. Watson, W.G. Spence and George Pearce) who, once they had achieved their immediate goals of reform, saw their subsequent role as defending the prevailing social order. 
 
 Like many of these men, Lynch's commitment to the labour movement's principles of solidarity and collective endeavour co-existed with a desire for material self advancement. More fundamentally, when Lynch accumulated property and was eventually able to take up the occupation which he had known in Ireland, farming, his evolving class interest inevitably occasioned a change in political outlook. Lynch is shown to have been an essentially conservative Meath farmer whose early involvement in the labour movement in Australia can be largely explained as a temporary phase consequent on emigration.
 
 A single-minded and robust politician, Lynch was able to reconcile first his Irish and then his Australian nationalist loyalties with the cause of the Empire as the best guarantee of Australia's future security and advancement. He both represented and reinforced the more conservative Irish Catholic political climate which prevailed in Western Australia, compared to the more populous eastern states. The relationship of the Catholic Irish to the early labour movement in Australia was more complex and problematical than orthodox thinking has allowed. As someone who straddled both political camps, Lynch encapsulated many of the inherent ambiguities of the immigrant Irish. A study of his career allows us to gain a deeper insight into the complexities of the Irish-Australian experience.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/32/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reedbeds for  the treatment of greywater as an application of ecological sanitation in rural Costa Rica, Central America</field><field name="creator">Dallas, Stewart</field><field name="description">The widespread practice in Latin America of separating greywater from blackwater at the domestic level lends itself to the application of Ecological Sanitation, or Ecosan. In this research simple, low-cost subsurface flow wetlands, or reedbeds, were investigated not only for their potential in treating the greywater component but also to evaluate their acceptance as an appropriate Ecosan technology in rural Central America. The hypothesis for this thesis is that Ecological Sanitation, namely via reedbeds for the treatment of greywater can improve sanitation in rural Central America. 
 
 The first aim of this research determined that untreated greywater was having a significant negative impact on the water quality of the local streams of Monteverde in Costa Rica (the site of this research) and that the associated public health risks will continue to increase in line with population growth. Local residents expressed strong dissatisfaction with the current situation and were supportive of any means to improve it. 
 
 The second aim of this research was to determine if reedbeds designed according to the principles of Ecosan could provide a healthier, affordable and more sustainable sanitation alternative suitable for rural areas. As a result five case study reedbed systems were designed and installed. All these reedbeds made use of locally available materials and incorporated low-maintenance design features, and research with a local plant species determined a robust macrophyte suitable for use in these systems. The ability of low-cost reedbed systems to successfully treat greywater was demonstrated. The Costa Rican guidelines for wastewater reuse were found to be overly restrictive in regards to fecal coliform limits (&gt; &lt;1,000cfu/100mL) and may inhibit the wider uptake of reedbed systems if enforced. Despite this the uptake of the reedbed technology was strong and more than ten systems were installed in Costa Rica as a result of this research. An innovative environmental services contract, the first of its kind in Costa Rica, was developed to ensure on going funding for operation and maintenance of a four-household reedbed system.
 
 The third aim was to specifically investigate the use of waste plastic (PET) bottle segments as an alternative media in reedbeds to conventional crushed rock, or gravel. Twelve mini-reedbeds, or cells, incorporating PET media and plants as the two variables, were monitored through wet and dry seasons. This experiment demonstrated that reedbeds incorporating PET segments were able to achieve comparable removal of fecal coliform and BOD when compared to conventional media reedbeds, and at a significantly reduced cost. The local plant species Coix lacryma-jobi enhanced the performance of all reedbeds, most notably in the PET-based reedbeds, which was attributed to the considerably greater root biomass achieved in these systems as compared to conventional media systems.
 
 This research has demonstrated that reedbeds incorporating simple, low-maintenance design features are able to provide an affordable and appropriate technology for the treatment of greywater in rural Latin America.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/33/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The discourse of weight control and the self</field><field name="creator">Davies, Deirdre</field><field name="description">This thesis offers an exploration of the discourse of weight control and examines how its concepts and goals are incorporated into the way people perceive and understand the self and others. The central focus is an analysis of the nexus between weight control and concerns surrounding 'excess' weight. The analysis reveals the way discourses on the balanced body, the normalised body, the healthy body, the natural body and the transformative body generate varying understandings of the normal, weight-controlled body and overweight body and in turn, how they give rise to different weight watching practices. It shows how the different ways of viewing the body also engender various visualisations of the subjects of weight control. It is argued the discourse of weight control is not put into effect by subjugation but through the generation of a personal desire to be slender and weight-controlled. As such, the central inquiry of the thesis also gives consideration to the impacts which discourses of weight control might have upon individuals in the constitution of self and identity. A sub-theme of the analysis is a consideration of the possibilities people have to engage with the discourse of weight control, in particular those who are considered overweight.
 
 Particular attention is paid throughout to the relationship between women and weight control. The findings are predominantly based upon content analysis of a broad range of primary texts including medico-scientific texts, historical material, policy and public health documents, and popular written and audiovisual media. The research is also informed to a less extent by participant observation at two weight loss centres and by semi-structured in-depth interviews with 13 women considered 'overweight' by current standards.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/35/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FLJ22318: a novel binding partner of the NKX3-1 homeodomain protein in prostate cancer cells</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Linda</field><field name="description">Prostate cancer is a frequently diagnosed malignancy which ranges from an indolent asymptomatic tumour to an aggressive, rapidly lethal systemic disease. Determination of chromosomal, genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with prostate carcinogenesis have led to the characterisation of functional consequences of these alterations, thereby elucidating pathways contributing to malignant growth that can be utilised clinically and therapeutically. 
 
 FLJ22318 is a novel hypothetical protein that was identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis to interact with the prostatic homeodomain protein, NKX3-1. Expression of NKX3-1 is largely restricted to epithelial cells of the adult prostate where it is involved in maintaining the prostatic phenotype, while NKX3-1 expression is reduced or absent in prostate tumours.  In contrast, FLJ22318 expression is documented in cDNA libraries derived from a variety of human adult and foetal tissues including the prostate, suggesting that it may be ubiquitously expressed and that it potentially interacts with a number of proteins in addition to NKX3-1. FLJ22318 expression is undocumented in human prostate tumours.
 
 Bioinformatic analyses have postulated multiple FLJ22318 mRNA transcripts however the proposed open reading frames encoded by these transcripts predict the FLJ22318 protein to contain three strong protein-protein interaction domains, a Lissencephaly type-1-like homology (LisH), a C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) and a CT11-RanBPM (CRA) domain. Of the 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified within the FLJ22318 gene, none are located within the protein coding region suggesting that FLJ22318 may be critical for cell survival and/or function. Comparison of the amino acid sequence between human FLJ22318 and its orthologues in a diverse range of mammalian species identified &gt;97% sequence homology, providing further strong evidence of the critical cellular function of FLJ22318.
 
 To characterise the biological activity of FLJ22318 in prostate cancer cells, the FLJ22318 coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ligated into mammalian and bacterial expression vectors to encode V5-, myc-, GFP-, HA-, and GST-FLJ22318 fusion proteins. Interaction between FLJ22318 and NKX3-1 was confirmed using (reverse) yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. These data were supported by confocal microscopy which demonstrated the perinuclear and nuclear co-localisation of FLJ22318 and NKX3-1 in prostate cancer cells. Northern blotting identified expression of ~2Kb and ~4Kb FLJ22318 mRNA's in prostate cancer cell lines, which was consistent with bioinformatic analyses of mRNA species. Transfection of prostate cancer cells to overexpress FLJ22318 did not alter endogenous NKX3-1 levels, however FLJ22318 exhibited transcriptional repressor function on an NKX3-1 responsive element and increased NKX3-1 transcriptional repressor activity on this element.
 
 To further investigate FLJ22318 function, additional yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed in prostate cancer cells to identify potential FLJ22318 binding proteins. These studies isolated cDNA's encoding 33 different proteins involved in cell metabolism and apoptosis as well as transcriptional regulators associated with control of cellular proliferation. One of the candidate FLJ22318 interactors, protein kinase, interferon-inducible double stranded RNA dependent activator (PRKRA/PACT) was shown using confocal microscopy to extensively co-localise with FLJ22318 in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions of prostate cancer cells. Preliminary co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays have provided additional evidence of the interaction of PRKRA and FLJ22318.
 
 Results of this thesis have generated important information characterising the structure of the FLJ22318 gene and protein, the interaction between FLJ22318 and NKX3-1 and the potential functions of FLJ22318 in prostate cancer cells. As the FLJ22318 gene is located on 5q35, a chromosomal region frequently disrupted in a variety of tumours, future studies of the biological activity of FLJ22318 will clarify its normal cellular functions and its contribution to tumorigenesis or malignant progression in the prostate and in other tissues.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/36/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagination, realisation and the performing of Australia</field><field name="creator">De Vos, Ricardo George</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that performance can be seen to constitute both a critical discipline and a set of activities entailing an engagement with spatial, temporal, physical and material relations, rather than as a product of linguistic, textual and discursive relations. As such, performance is able to critique the functioning of language, text and discourse in assuming space, time, bodies and matter. Performance also suggests ways of working on and informing writing practices. The social relations of performance pertain to times and spaces which are temporary and processual, to activities which imagine other times, spaces and people, and seek to realise them for a specific time in a specific space for a specific group of people. The social relations realised in this process of contingent realities are able to inform writing, that is, to produce writing which connects theatre with other discourses, and which connects words with bodies in time and space.
 
 It is argued that theatre and performance's process of imagination and realisation and its engagement with spatial, temporal, physical and material relations provides a valuable site for critically examining the ways in which Australia privileges and remembers specific configurations of space, time, bodies and matter, while marginalising others, in producing official representations of the Australian nation. Such representations, reflected ingovernmental programmes such as those concerning citizenship and national security, have a bearing on how Australians view their national past, present and future, and how they perceive their social connections with each other.
 
 Just as specific performances are made subject to the textual and discursive categories of literature and social theory, official enactments of the Australian nation are able to 'contain' Australians who spatially, temporally and physically transgress national boundaries. As a material practice, performance is able to engage with official enactments of the nation in order to 're-open' the spaces, times and encounters concealed within these sites.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/37/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberating the disabled identity: a coalition of subjugated knowledges</field><field name="creator">Galvin, Rose</field><field name="description">My thesis explores the notion, originally developed by sociologists such as Goffman and Charmaz, that a person's identity undergoes a difficult and painful metamorphosis in response to the effects of serious long-term impairment or chronic illness. I argue that existing methods of researching what I have come to call 'the disabled identity' generally avoid a deeper exploration of the social context in which this kind of marginalisation occurs. To address this absence, I develop a research methodology which combines an intensive exploration of the personal experience of disability with a critical analysis of the social and historical context in which the disabling of identity occurs. I approach the former through grounded theory and the latter through a Foucaultian analytics of genealogy and governmentality. These are informed by the theoretical insights surrounding the 'social model' of disability which claims that 'disability' is not a physical problem based on personal tragedy but is a social imposition based on exclusion and stigmatisation. 
 
 In accordance with this, the thesis proceeds in three successive stages. First, I apply a genealogical analysis to disability in general, then more specifically to the disabled identity, to provide the background for my qualitative research. The purpose of genealogy is to reveal that the concept under investigation is not a self-evident 'given' but a social construction which has developed to serve varying interests over time. Through this process it becomes evident that disability has evolved as a concept which performs as a counterpoint to the norm and, as such, provides a measure of 'what not to be' in terms of contemporary neoliberal citizenship. 
 
 Next, I engage in a grounded theory study which draws on the stories of disabled people to explore how their self-perceptions and the attitudes of those around them have been affected by disability. These stories stem from a variety of data sources, including my dialogues with participants, written stories from participants, and published autobiographies. Their analysis results in the emergence of the following themes: independence, occupational identity, and sexuality/appearance. Each theme is discussed in a separate chapter which attempts to let the stories speak for themselves by way of lengthy excerpts from the participants and texts, and combines them, where relevant, with my own insights and experiences as a disabled person.
 
 In the final stage, I use a governmentality analysis to explore these themes and to place them in their current social and historical context. Here I suggest that independence, work and sexuality are key factors which are used to divide the affiliated from the marginalised in contemporary neoliberal societies. I argue that the two 'technologies' which currently have the most impact on how independence, work and sexuality are governed in relation to disability are welfare reform and sexual rehabilitation. Here I explore the available primary sources - particularly the last five years of Australian government policy on welfare reform and a selection of sexual rehabilitation texts - to reveal how governance seeks to operate as a liberatory force while remaining oppressive due to its paternalism and reinforcement of normative prescriptions. 
 
 The final chapter further problematises disability in relation to the governmental concepts of 'self-esteem' and 'empowerment' in an attempt to unpick what can be claimed to be emancipatory from what remains embedded in the dominant discourse. By 'deconstructing necessity' and exploring the root causes of oppression through what Foucault refers to as 'the disinterment of subjugated knowledges', the thesis outlines an alternative discourse in relation to 'disability' and opens up new possibilities for the creation of more positive identities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/38/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The underwater acoustic repertoire of the long-necked, freshwater turtle Chelodina oblonga</field><field name="creator">Giles, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">The major question addressed by this project was to determine if the long-necked, freshwater turtle Chelodina oblonga, vocalise underwater and whether their vocal activity could be related to behavioural or ecological aspects of their lives. These turtles often live in wetlands where visibility is restricted due to habitat complexity or light limitation caused by factors such as tannin-staining, or turbidity. For many aquatic animals, sound is a useful means of communication over distances beyond their visual acuity. This thesis gives the first detailed account of the underwater vocal repertoire of C. oblonga.
 
 In total, over 230 days were spent in the field and more than 500 hours of tape recordings were made for this research. Initially, a number of recordings took place in three wetlands known to support turtle populations: Blue Gum Lake; Glen Brook Dam; and Lake Leschenaultia in Perth, Western Australia; in order to determine the nature of the freshwater sound field and place turtle vocalisations into the context in which they were vocalising. The wetlands differed in terms of degree of enrichment, substrate material, water depth and habitat complexity. Recordings were made over a four-week period in the last month of summer and the first week of autumn (Feb-Mar 2003). Invertebrate sweeps were also taken over a two-week period at each recording site to determine if invertebrate distributions were related to patterns of sonic activity. To determine the influence of wind on ambient noise; recordings were undertaken on winter mornings (June-August, 2003) at Blue Gum Lake and Glen Brook Dam at locations north, south, west and east for four different wind speeds - Beaufort Wind Scale (BWS) 0,1,2 and 3.
 
 There were seven distinctive calls recognised in the recordings. The frequency bandwidth most utilised by organisms was between 3 kHz up to around 14 kHz, with the exception of the 'bird-like song'; which extended from 500 Hz up to around 10 kHz. Blue Gum Lake contained a more diverse and abundant assemblage of invertebrates than Lake Leschenaultia and Glen Brook Dam. Correspondingly, a greater diversity of calls was recorded at Blue Gum Lake, as well as the presence of chorus activity, which was not heard at the two less-enriched sites. The periods of greatest diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates was synonymous with the increased sonic activity at dusk and midnight with noise levels greatest at dusk in particular, and to a lesser extent at midnight. There was no difference in ambient noise at Blue Gum Lake or Glen Brook Dam at wind speeds of Beaufort Wind Scale 0, 1 and 2.
 
 Turtles from three populations were recorded in artificial environments: consisting of round, plastic, above-ground ponds (1.8m dia. x 0.65m depth), which were set up to recreate small wetlands. Recordings occurred from September to October, 2003 and from February to December, 2004 as well as January, 2005. Seven hatchling and five juvenile turtles (CL &lt; 10cm) were also recorded in order to ascertain whether very young turtles vocalised. Hatchlings were recorded in a glass aquarium (35.5cm length x 20cm width x 22.0cm depth) and juveniles were placed into a below-ground outdoor pond (1m length x 0.5m width x 0.4m depth). Recordings occurred from as early as 4.30am (dawn recordings) to as late as 1.30am (evening recordings).
 
 The recordings revealed that turtles utilise an underwater acoustic communication system (calling at the water's surface was also noted but these were not recorded or a part of this research) involving a repertoire of both complex and percussive sounds with short, medium and potentially long-range propagation characteristics. Complex structures included harmonically related elements (richly or sparsely) and different rates of frequency modulation. Frequency use extended beyond the in-air auditory sensitivity known for a single species of turtle studied from the family Chelidae; with calls ranging from around 100 Hz in some of the percussive displays, to as high as 3.5 kHz in some complex calls, with 'clicks' extending beyond the 20 kHz upper limit of the recording system. However, most of C. oblonga's vocalisations had dominant frequencies below 1 kHz. Turtles were intermittent callers with an extensive vocal repertoire of seventeen (17) vocal categories - highly suggestive of complex social organisation. Vocalisations included: a) clacks; b) clicks; c) squawks; d) hoots; e) short chirps; f) high short chirps; g) medium chirps; h) long chirps; i) high calls; j) cries or wails; k) cat whines; l) grunts; m) growls; n) blow bursts; o) staccatos; p) a wild howl; and q) drum rolling. Also, two sustained 'pulse-bouts' were recorded during the breeding months, hypothesised to function as acoustic advertisement displays - possibly 'calling songs'. Hatchling turtles were not heard to vocalise within the audible range. Only a single complex vocalisation was heard produced by the juvenile turtles, with a number of percussive calls.
 
 Preliminary playback trials were conducted under free-field conditions and within an artificial environment, which consisted of a below ground rectangular tank (2.4m length x 0.8m width x 0.6m deep). A number of turtle calls recorded in the artificial ponds were selected for playback. A UW 30 speaker was used for broadcast of calls. The free-field playbacks occurred at Mabel Talbot Lake and Blue Gum Lake during the months of April and May, 2005. Playback using 14 seconds of an artificially constructed sequence from the sustained 'pulse-bout' occurred in the artificial channels. This sequence consisted of some of the first phase pulses followed by a section of the 'vibrato'.
 
 The preliminary free-field playback trials indicated that turtles had some interest in the calls being played by responding with an 'alert posture'. Turtles were shown to remain in the alert posture for a significantly longer time than when no sound was played or when white noise was played. The extensive repertoire and initial responses to the free-field playbacks indicated that sound has some biological importance for C. oblonga, although results of playbacks under artificial conditions were inconclusive.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/39/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploitation of the protein tubulin for controlling African trypanosomiasis</field><field name="creator">Giles, Natalie</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of an investigation into the structural protein, tubulin, as a potential target for anti-trypanosomatid drug discovery and vaccine development. Recombinant alpha- and beta- tubulin proteins from Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in an E. coli expression system. The recombinant alpha- and beta- tubulins were used to determine the nature of binding of novel trifluralin analogues EPL-AJ 1003, 1007, 1008, 1016 and 1017. Native tubulin from rats was used to determine the extent of binding to mammalian tubulin. The results of this study clearly demonstrate two important aspects of the binding of trifluralins to tubulin. Firstly, they have specific affinity for trypanosomal tubulin compared with mammalian regardless of the chemical composition of the trifluralin analogue tested. Secondly, they have a demonstrably stronger affinity for alpha-tubulin compared with beta-tubulin. In addition, compounds 1007, 1008, 1016 and 1017 have strong binding affinities for alpha-tubulin, with limited binding affinity for mammalian tubulin, which indicates that these compounds selectively bind to trypanosomal tubulin. 
 
 The morphology of bloodstream forms of T. b. rhodesiense exposed to trifluralin analogues was studied using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence to determine the ultrastructural changes these compounds induce as a result of binding to tubulin. All compounds tested induced severe irreparable damage in T. b. rhodesiense, including perturbation of subpellicular microtubules, extensive cytoplasmic swellings, axoneme and paraflagellar rod malformation, disconfiguration around the flagellar pocket and membrane disintegration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of these trifluralin analogues is through the disruption of polymerization of tubulin into microtubules as a result of binding to alpha-tubulin. 
 
 The potential for recombinant trypanosomal tubulins to be used as vaccine candidates was assessed by monitoring parasitaemia and length of survival of mice immunised with the proteins and challenged with a lethal infection of T. b. rhodesiense. Although all the mice vaccinated with recombinant tubulin developed a patent parasitaemia and did not survive, they were partially protected because their patency period and length of survival were significantly greater than the control groups. Furthermore, plasma collected from mice immunised with recombinant trypanosomal tubulin contained antibodies that recognized tubulin in a soluble extraction from T. b. rhodesiense. The results of this thesis confirm the potential for the structural protein, tubulin, to be used as a target for anti-trypanosomatid drug discovery and vaccine development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/40/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Captured becomings: an assemblage of sexual difference, neoliberal capitalism and bodies in the boys' education debate</field><field name="creator">Gobby, Brad</field><field name="description">This study investigates the current influence of conservative political, social and economic forces in structuring the perspectives of five pre-service teachers on the education of boys. I argue that these perspectives are constituted by a conservative assemblage of essentialist discourses of sexuality and neoliberal capitalism and these largely extend the indomitable power of conservative forces increasingly shaping social relations inside and outside the field of education.
 
 The interviews reveal that conservative discourses of sexual difference dominate the perspectives on boys and their schooling and this reliance on essentialist notions of sexuality effectively gives rise to a conflicting roles discourse that informs a recuperative masculinity politics and feminist backlash. I argue the social transformation effected by neoliberal economics is largely silenced when discussing boys and education and this allows participants to largely 'blame' feminism for the transformation of labour markets, work patterns, family relationships and gendered subjectivities, silencing its powerful influence. I contend personal insecurity and anxiety generated by neoliberal economic transformation have proliferated conservative discourses of sexuality, producing a defence of rigid sexual boundaries that proscribe the potential of male and female bodies by capturing their 'becoming', and to this extent I argue that conservative discourses of sexual difference are coextensive with the aims of neoliberal capitalism. However, rather than position men as victims, I argue the conservative assemblage including the boys' debate make available diverse ways for many individuals to experience their body powerfully, with the attributes and capacities of hegemonic masculinity being proliferated. The boys' debate is one resource for producing powerful subjectivities while extending the territory of the conservative assemblage increasingly constituting our world.
 
 Methodologically this is a qualitative inquiry that utilizes discourse analysis extensively informed by poststructural theories of knowledge, power and the subject. I also make connections with the work of Deleuze and Guattari and the theories of corporeal feminism, including a theory of the body as a machinic assemblage in order to interrogate the conservative territorialisation of subjectivity and social relations. Finally, I argue the need to consider the alignment of discourses of sexual difference, neoliberal capitalism and the body in order to create a future beyond the limits currently defined by our culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/41/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA methods for the detection of Phytophthora cinnamomi from soil</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Nari Michelle</field><field name="description">This project assesses two aspects of DNA detection of Phytophthora species from soil samples. Firstly, a nested PCR protocol was established with both primary and nested PCR specific for P. cinnamomi detection. PCR amplification of P. cinnamomi DNA isolated from soil was optimised with the addition of bovine serum albumin and formamide. This was found to improve both the specificity and sensitivity of PCR amplification of DNA in the presence of inhibitors co-extracted along with the target DNA from soil samples. The application of diagnostic nested PCR with the addition of BSA and formamide was verified by comparison with routine culture based detection methods. In all cases, nested PCR detection incorporating BSA and formamide was found to be considerably more sensitive than the culture based detection methods. 
 
 The second component of this thesis investigates the simultaneous detection of multiple species of Phytophthora using microarray analysis. Microarray based detection has been previously limited by variable and inconsistent hybridisation intensities across the diversity of probes used in each array. In this study a novel concept for the differentiation of detection targets using duplex melting kinetics is introduced. A microarray assay was developed on a PamChip microarray enabling the differentiation of target Phytophthora species using the melting kinetics of probe-target duplexes. In the majority of cases the hybridization kinetics of target and non-target duplexes differed significantly. Analysis of the melting kinetics of duplexes formed by probes with target and non-target DNA was found to be an effective method for determining specific hybridization and was independent of fluctuations in hybridization signal intensity. This form of analysis was more robust than the traditional approach based on hybridisation intensity, and allowed the detection of individual Phytophthora species and mixtures there of.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/42/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The invention of the environment as a legal subject</field><field name="creator">Goodie, Jo</field><field name="description">The legal regulation of the environment is exemplary of the formation, practice and challenge of modern legal discourse and governance. The latter part of the twentieth century has seen the emergence of environmentalism and the problematisation of the environment in terms of the management of hazard and risk. The social authority of law has meant that it has been inevitably implicated in the contestation and negotiation of environmental governance. In turn, environmental governance and discourse have required a certain refiguring of legal rationality as legal discourse has been confronted by the immanent critique of environmentalism. This thesis will focus on how the environment emerged as problematic and how it came to be governed and of legal interest. Several examples of legal thinking concerning specific environmental problems are analysed, and the manner in which the environment is constructed within the legal discursive domain is examined.
 
 Much modern knowledge and understanding regarding the environment developed in part from the specialisation of scientific discourse and experiment, which formed certain areas of expertise, including biology, ecology and toxicology. This scientific knowledge significantly contributed to governmental identification and elucidation of the environment. Modern ecology and associated technologies have facilitated the detailed mapping and auditing of physical environments, and have profoundly effected our modern appreciation of 'the environment' as an interdependent, dynamic and potentially fragile web of interdependent physical zones, spaces and activities. Modern environmentalism has emerged through the application of this type of technical scientific knowledge, in combination with certain forms of 'environmental sensibility' which treat the environment, not as a thing, or somehow 'out there', but as a dynamic process of which humans are a part, which has a history, an economy, and a power to transform and be transformed. The shape of modern environmental governance has been especially influenced by the scientific and ethical critique of environmentalism that connects the origin of ecological risks to technological application and commodity production. 
 
 Throughout this thesis, specific aspects of the 'analytics of government' or governmentality approach derived from Foucault's writing on governmentality are taken up. Governmentality theory is largely concerned with the contingent relationship between knowledge and power; thus, with analysing specific discourses and associated spaces within which differing knowledge and forms of thinking interrelate and resist each other. The contestation and negotiation associated with environmental governance has confronted legal discourse and led to a refiguring of legal rationality. Legal governance of the environment has stretched and unsettled legal orthodoxy, as the environment does not readily fit into any of the usual categories pertaining to legal rights and interests. The environment, as a legal subject, is not simply a physical space; it is a contingent and instrumental concept, determined by human activity, social values and legal and non-legal calculation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/43/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moorditj magic: the story of Jim and Phillip Krakouer</field><field name="creator">Gorman, Sean</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses and investigates the issue of racism in the football code of Australian Rules to understand how racism is manifested in Australian daily life.

Their experience of migration, discrimination and displacement was exacerbated by the internment, the single most influential episode in their history which had a profound effect on subsequent generations.  It is argued the trauma of their experiences can be located in their writing and, drawing on the works of Freud and trauma theoreticians Cathy Caruth and Ruth Leys in particular, the thesis constructs a theoretical framework which may be applied to post-internment Japanese diasporic writing to reveal the traces of trauma in all generations, traces that are linked to what Freud referred to as a posterior moment that triggered an earlier trauma which the subject may not have experienced personally but which may be lodged in her / her psyche. An examination of the literature of the Japanese diaspora shows that trauma is carried in the language itself and impacted upon the collective psyche of the entire community.
 
 The theoretical model is used to read the tanka poetry written by the immigrant generation, a range of texts by the first American-born generation (including an in-depth analysis of four texts spanning several decades) and the texts written by the third-generation, many of whom did not experience the internment themselves so their motivation and the influence of the internment differed greatly from earlier generations.  The thesis concludes with an analysis of David Mura's identification of the link between identity, sexuality and the influence of the internment experience as transmitted by his parents.

These species are fished commercially and/or recreationally in this large subtropical marine embayment, which is a world heritage area. The biology of C. rubescens was also studied in the Abrolhos Islands, which are located ~ 300 km to the south of Shark Bay, where this labrid is an important commercial and recreational fish species. The broad aims of this project were to determine the following for the above four Choerodon species in Shark Bay. (1) Whether they are protogynous hermaphrodites, as is the case with many labrids. (2) The biological variables required for developing management plans for these species, such as the timing of spawning, the lengths and ages at both maturity and sex change, size and age compositions and growth parameters, and (3) the habitat types occupied during their life cycles and also of the purple tuskfish Choerodon cephalotes. Finally, comparisons are made between the age and size compositions, growth and reproductive biology of C. rubescens in Shark Bay and the Abrolhos Islands. Where relevant, the underlying hypotheses for the individual studies conducted during this PhD are included in the following chapters.
 
 A macroscopic and histological examination of the gonads of the full size range of C. cyanodus, C. cauteroma, C. rubescens and C. schoenleinii, together with an analysis of the length and age compositions of female, transitional (individuals changing sex) and male individuals, demonstrated that each of these species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, i.e. individuals change sex from female to male during their life cycle. The gonads of all small (&gt; &lt; ca 100 mm) and young (&gt; &lt; ca 1 year old) individuals of each species comprised solely ovarian tissue and thus the individuals of each species began life as a female. All individuals subsequently become sexually mature as females and then later in life some will change to males. Since this was found to be the only method of sex change in these species, they are termed monandric. Individuals that were changing sex contained 'undelimited type 2' gonads sensu Sadovy and Shapiro (1987). These gonads contained both ovarian and testicular tissue that was intermixed and not separated by connective tissue. The males of each species possessed secondary testes, which retained structures of the ovary they had replaced, such as a membrane-lined ovarian lumen, lamellae and ovary wall. Furthermore, histological sections indicated that sperm were transported towards the outer walls of the testes, where the multiple sperm sinuses present in that region were presumably responsible for transporting sperm to the cloaca, rather than to a singular sperm duct as is the case with gonochoristic species.
 
 The typically large size and different colour of the males of C. rubescens, C. schoenleinii and C. cauteroma and the bias in the sex ratios of their adults towards females suggests that the males of each of these species are either haremic, i.e. permanently territorial, or form leks, i.e. are temporarily territorial during their spawning seasons. In these three species, the presence of ripe testes that are far smaller than ripe ovaries and the release by females of eggs in batches are consistent with a single male spawning with an individual female, as commonly occurs in haremic/lekking species. In contrast to the above species, C. cyanodus was not sexually dichromatic, the sex ratio was not biased towards either sex and the weight of ripe testes remained relatively constant as body weight increased. The latter implies that the relative investment of energy by males into testicular development during the spawning season declines with increasing fish size. Thus, the males of C. cyanodus may be opportunistic spawners when small, possibly spawning in groups, and may tend towards a haremic or lek mode of life when larger.
 
 The respective lengths and ages at which 50% of the females of C. cyanodus C. cauteroma and C. schoenleinii attained sexual maturity (L50m, A50m) in Shark Bay were ca 129, 196 and 253 mm and 2.3, 2.0 and 3.5 years of age. The corresponding L50m and A50m for C. rubescens in Shark Bay and the Abrolhos Islands were ca 274 and 279 mm, respectively, and 2.7 and 4.1 years of age, respectively. The respective lengths and ages at which 50% of the females of C. cyanodus, C. cauteroma and C. schoenleinii changed to males (L50c, A50c) in Shark Bay were 221, 310 and 556 mm and 4.1, 6.4 and 10.4 years of age. The length at which C. rubescens changed sex (L50c) was significantly greater in Shark Bay (545 mm) than in the Abrolhos Islands (479 mm), whereas the reverse pertained with respect to the age at sex change (A50c), i.e. 10.5 vs 11.9 years of age. Since some females were found in the oldest age classes of each species in Shark Bay and in the population of C. rubescens in the Abrolhos Islands, some of the females of each species do not apparently change sex.
 
 The trends exhibited by the gonadosomatic indices of females and males and the stages of ovarian development in sequential months demonstrated that the spawning periods of each species varied. Thus, C. rubescens (in both Shark Bay and the Abrolhos Islands) and C. cauteroma spawn predominantly in spring, whereas spawning occurs in late spring/early summer in C. schoenleinii and in summer in C. cyanodus. As C. schoenleinii, C. cyanodus and C. cauteroma occur predominantly within the inner gulfs of Shark Bay, the offset in the timing of their spawning periods would be likely to reduce any potential for competition between the larvae of those three species for resources.
 
 The trends exhibited by the mean monthly marginal increments in sectioned otoliths with differing numbers of opaque zones demonstrated that, in each species, those opaque zones were laid down annually. Thus, the numbers of opaque zones in the sectioned otoliths of individuals of each species could be used, in conjunction with the birth date and time of year when those zones are delineated, to determine their approximate ages at capture. The maximum ages recorded for the four Choerodon species in Shark Bay ranged only from 12 to 16 years. However, in that environment, the maximum lengths of C. rubescens (649 mm) and C. schoenleinii (805 mm) were far greater than those of C. cauteroma (424 mm) and C. cyanodus (382 mm). In contrast to the situation with C. rubescens in Shark Bay, this species reached a substantially older maximum age (22 years), but slightly shorter length (629 mm), and grew at a slower rate in the Abrolhos Islands, possibly reflecting the influence of greater productivity in Shark Bay and/or greater densities of this species in the Abrolhos Islands.
 
 Although a few C. rubescens and C. schoenleinii reach large sizes in Shark Bay, most of the individuals of these species were less than 400 mm, their minimum legal length (MLL) for capture. This raises the possibility that these two sought after species, i.e. the seventh and ninth most abundant species in the recreational fishery in Shark Bay, are subjected to substantial fishing pressure. Sampling for C. cyanodus was considered representative of the sites that this species occupies in Shark Bay and the sampling methods would have been likely to have captured the full size range of this tuskfish. Thus, the failure to catch any C. cyanodus greater than 400 mm indicates that, in Shark Bay, this species does not grow to the far greater lengths of about 600 mm reported for this species as a maximum by Allen (1999). Furthermore, the 400 mm MLL for this species in Western Australia precludes the retention by fishers of this species in this environment. Choerodon cauteroma was caught at lengths up to 424 mm, which is greater than the maximum of 360 mm reported for this species (Allen, 1999). Although there is no MLL for C. cauteroma, recreational fishers are restricted to a bag limit of four fish per person per day, as is the case with all other tuskfish species.
 
 Since fishers target large fish preferentially and the largest size classes of each of the species of tuskfish are dominated by males, heavy fishing pressure has the potential to remove a large proportion of the males of the Choerodon species that are fished in Shark Bay, i.e. C. rubescens, C. schoenleinii and C. cauteroma, and also of C. rubescens in the Abrolhos Islands. Since the ratio of females to males in catches of C. rubescens taken by the commercial fishery in the Abrolhos Islands are ca 1:1 and yet the typical adult sex ratio is heavily biased towards females (ca 14:1), that fishery is removing a substantial proportion of the males from the population. Protogynous hermaphroditic species are apparently able to respond to such pressure on the males by initiating a change in sex by the larger females. However, there is evidence from studies of other protogynous species that heavy size-selective fishing can lead to a reduction in the size and age at which a species changes sex and ultimately to a collapse in the stock.
 
 The results of visual surveys, when taken in conjunction with the locations of the catches of each of the five Choerodon species, demonstrated that C. rubescens lives on reefs in 'oceanic' waters along the western boundary of Shark Bay, whereas C. schoenleinii, C. cyanodus, C. cauteroma and C. cephalotes are found predominantly in the two inner gulfs of this large embayment. Choerodon cephalotes lives almost exclusively in seagrass beds, while C. schoenleinii and C. cyanodus occupy predominantly inner gulf reefs and rocky shorelines and C. cauteroma occurs in all of those three habitats. Choerodon cauteroma was the only species that underwent an obvious size-related shift during its life cycle, moving from seagrass to hard substrates, such as inner gulf reefs and rocky shorelines, as it reached adulthood.
 
 The biological and habitat data produced during this thesis will provide fisheries and environmental managers with the types of information that will enable them to develop management plans for conserving tuskfish species and their habitats in Shark Bay. The biological data for C. rubescens in the Abrolhos Islands will be able likewise to be used to develop plans for conserving the stock of this species in waters in which it is heavily fished.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/47/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The anatomy of two medical archetypes: a socio-historical study of Australian doctors and their rival medical systems</field><field name="creator">Farag, Christine Victoria</field><field name="description">In this thesis it is argued that the migration of ideas and personnel from Britain to colonial Australia resulted in the reproduction of two distinctive medical archetypes, namely, the soldier/saviour and the generalist (family) physician and surgeon.  These have been both conceptualised as ideal type carriers or expediters of two rival forms of medical professionalism. They each emerged in the modern era as institutional products of distinctive educational processes and work practices available for doctors in 19th and 20th century Britain and Australia. While Freidson (1988) asserts one of the problems of dealing with studies of professionalism is that researchers have failed to clearly define work patterns, he could be seen as being close to Foucault (1973) whose emphasis was on the different social spaces in which practitioners worked.  
 
 I show firstly that the career of the imperial army medical officer was revived in the 19th century so that in colonial contexts they could alternate between military and civilian servicing, especially as administrators and managers in public office. The soldier/saviour was also associated with the 19th century revival of Masonic and quasi-Masonic military and religious orders, consecrated by royal sovereigns and exported to Australia.  In contrast, the Scottish pedagogues and other generalist doctors coming to Australia from Britain were influenced by Edinburgh University's Medical Faculty's humanist traditions and design of the modern medical curriculum producing the generalist physician and surgeon who met community needs. Within wider imperial social relations, these generalist doctors were looked upon as dissenting or counter-hegemonic.  
 
 The aim of this thesis is to examine these archetypes in terms of their characteristics of rationalisation to analyse and understand their professional differences historically as well as in the contemporary period. The significance is that one does not often come across studies which specifically look at doctors within the same society in such terms. Furthermore, by locating them within wider hegemonic and counter-hegemonic social relations, links between ideas about medical professionalism and issues of human rights become evident. This follows the World Health Organization's directives to treat health or medical issues and human rights as a cross-cutting research activity. To my knowledge, no study has been undertaken in Australia of the background and impact of these different traditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/48/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation biology of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Perth metropolitan waters</field><field name="creator">Finn, Hugh</field><field name="description">This thesis examines two potential conservation problems for a residential sub-population of ~75 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Cockburn Sound, a small embayment within the southern metropolitan waters of Perth, Western Australia: (1) human-induced habitat change and (2) illegal feeding (i.e. unregulated provisioning) of dolphins. The work is important because Cockburn Sound is the most intensively utilised marine environment in Western Australia and industrial, commercial, and recreational uses of the area will intensify in coming decades. These considerations, coupled with the demographic and ecological vulnerability of residential populations of small cetaceans, suggested a risk of population decline without a more informed scientific basis for management. This study (2000 - 2003) complemented an earlier study of the Cockburn Sound dolphins (1993 - 1997) to provide a decade-long longitudinal study of the population. The original contributions of this study relate to: (a) the foraging ecology of dolphins;(b) the effects and mechanisms of human-dolphin interaction, particularly interactions based on unregulated provisioning; and (c) an integration of previous research and other information.
 
 Studies of the foraging ecology of dolphins within Cockburn Sound were undertaken between 2000-2 to determine the areas used by dolphins and their feeding behaviours so that the implications of human-induced habitat change could be assessed. These studies used belt transect sampling and event-specific sampling of foraging aggregations of dolphins to quantify the foraging habitat use of dolphins within the Sound and to characterise spatial and temporal patterns in aggregations of foraging dolphins. The results showed that the density of foraging dolphins varied significantly across habitats and that foraging aggregations consistently occur in an area known as the Kwinana Shelf during the austral autumn-spring period. The studies also suggested that the foraging ecology of dolphins in Cockburn Sound reflects the consistent utilisation of both: (a) low-density prey species (i.e. individual or weakly-schooling prey) and (b) high-density prey species (i.e. schooling species such as forage fish). These findings indicate that ecosystem-based conservations of the population should consider the conservation requirements of dolphin prey species and the ecological integrity of key foraging habitats like the Kwinana Shelf.
 
 Human-dolphin interactions based on the illegal feeding of dolphins in Cockburn Sound escalated between 1993 and 2003. By 2003, a total of 14 individuals exhibited behaviours indicative of conditioning to human interaction by food reinforcement, including some individuals that engaged in provisioning interactions on a chronic (i.e. long-term) basis. Observations of the effects of unregulated provisioning indicated that: (a) provisioned dolphins sustained increased higher rates of human-induced injury than non-provisioned dolphins and (b) provisioning was associated with substantial and enduring behavioural changes including changes in ranging and association patterns. Other observations of human-induced injury in Cockburn Sound included seven instances of calf entanglement. These findings indicate that the effects of illegal feeding and other forms of direct human-dolphin interaction (e.g. entanglement) could achieve biological significance for the population.
 
 The possible contribution of (a) human influences, (b) social learning, and (c) behavioural propensities (e.g. age and sex) on the acquisition of an attraction response to human provisioning was examined through logistic regression analysis using age, sex, use of high-boat density areas, and the number of close associates that were previously provisioned as predictor variables and the acquisition of an attraction response as the dependent variable. This analysis was supplemented by behavioural observations of interactions between provisioned and naive individuals during provisioning interactions. The results supported three findings: (1) a relatively high level of exposure to human provisioners was a significant predictor for the acquisition of an attraction response by dolphins; (2) social learning contributed to the acquisition of an attraction response in those individuals that more frequently utilised high-boat density areas; and (3) the potential contribution of behavioural propensities relating to age and sex was uncertain. These conclusions suggest that the acquisition of an attraction response to human provisioning can best be understood as the outcome of a complex of interacting factors. 
 
 The findings also indicate: (a) the management value of individual-specific and longitudinal data for the management of harmful human-wildlife interactions and (b) the potential for social learning to contribute to the development and persistence of these interactions. The findings of this study indicate that population decline in Cockburn Sound could be induced by: (1) a reduction in the Sound?s environmental carrying capacity or (2) mortality, injury, and behavioural changes resulting from interactions with humans. The potential for such a decline and evidence demonstrating the harmful effects of human activities on dolphins supports the application of preventative approach to the management of illegal feeding and entanglement and a precautionary approach to environmental impact assessments of proposed developments. Mitigation of direct human-dolphins like illegal feeding requires an enforcement and education program to encourage more responsible human attitudes towards interactions with dolphins. Research on the ecology and composition of finfish assemblages and the trophic structure of the Kwinana shelf would assist efforts to mitigate the impact of human-induced habitat change.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/49/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology transfer for sustainable development through clean development mechanism (CDM): the Bangladesh perspectives</field><field name="creator">Amin, Md. Rabiul</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as a new instrument for technology transfer to developing countries, especially Bangladesh, in order to analyse its potential and develop policies and strategies for its successful implementation. The main research question the thesis addresses is whether the Clean Development Mechanism can assist the sustainable development of developing countries, such as Bangladesh.
 
 Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism allows developed countries to invest in abatement opportunities in developing countries and receive credit for the resulting emissions reductions, thus becoming a tool for technology transfer. In the past, developing countries have been eager to participate in technology transfer but this has often come at a cost and not in the most beneficial way. The spirit of the CDM is to support sustainable development and encourage mutually beneficial transfer of appropriate technologies. 
 
 The CDM is a form of market tool in which valuable goods and services are to be bought and sold. A number of technical, regulatory, project finance and administrative functions must be performed for this tool to operate. Many of these functions may be most effectively undertaken by private markets or existing international institutions. However, developing countries face problems during international technology transfer, that are still apparent under the CDM; for example: lack of proper knowledge, inadequate bargaining power, insufficient skilled persons and capable human resources, not enough adaptive capabilities, limited number of sophisticated physical facilities, fear about the effective control over national assets, uncertainty about the effects of foreign investment on the exploitation of national resources, etc. On the other hand, the CDM has the potential to fund 'technological leapfrogging' that would enable developing countries to bypass inefficient choices, such as coal technology, made by industrialised countries. 
 
 Poverty alleviation and development problems have been the main concern of poor countries among an obvious shortage of good will on the part of governments in industrialised countries to contribute towards these aims. New mechanisms that can stimulate investment from government as well as the private sector are needed to combat these shortcomings. Does the CDM have the potential to contribute to these broader goals? This research explores how the Clean Development Mechanism can potentially play such a role and how suitable it is within the broader picture of poverty and underdevelopment in the case of Bangladesh.
 
 This thesis argues that the CDM, which came into force early in 2005, has the potential to become a useful tool in coping with climate change and benefit the entire global population. However, the majority of developing countries will have to balance national necessities, such as poverty eradication, food security and education, with encouraging CDM projects. The only way the CDM can contribute to sustainable development in these parts of the world (including Bangladesh) is if the mechanism embraces simultaneously social, economic and environmental responsibility and avoids becoming yet another tool to make the economically rich more richer.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/51/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing-between: Australian and Canadian ficto-criticism</field><field name="creator">Flavell, Helen</field><field name="description">The current cultural climate, theoretical developments, the changing state of the tertiary institution, and the increasing presence of voices from the margin have contributed to the critical re-evaluation of academic writing as a way of knowing and representing the world. At the same time, hybrid forms of writing, those that exist in the interstices of established generic codes, are experiencing increased critical attention. Yet, despite the fact that genre has become an inadequate notion to describe boundary-crossing writing, little appears to have shifted in the way these forms are understood. Dominant methodologies tend to render what is between less visible or valid, and they define this space only in terms of its relation to set borders. Located at the boundaries of what is familiar and unfamiliar, 'writing-between' is a contentious space where elements are combined without clear rules to aid identification. In this thesis the term 'ficto-criticism' is used broadly to describe generically transgressive writing that blurs the defining lines between creative and critical texts. The thesis explores the political and theoretical implications of writing-between through a discussion of Australian and Canadian work in English (or English translation), which display the characteristics of the ficto-critical form. This thesis argues for a critical understanding of ficto-criticism that conceptualises it as a highly political strategy of literary intervention, rather than as a mere trend toward cross-genre writing. Indeed, rather than understanding it as surface play, the thesis argues that ficto-critical practice is deeply troubled by the oppressive role of academic writing and that, significantly, its emergence was highly influenced by postcolonial and feminist theory. Thus, ficto-critical practice interrogates the violence of representation and explores what is left out and or misrepresented through that process. The thesis applies Deleuze and Guattari's concept-tools to articulate a methodology by virtue of which desire and ficto-criticism are understood as productive forms that are liberated from an equation of lack. The tension between ficto-criticism as an open practice and the tradition of scholarly writing, which requires a clear fixed proposition and outcomes, mirrors the project of ficto-criticism, which seeks to unlearn one's authority and privilege as the beginning of a process towards developing an ethical relationship with the other.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/53/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Subterranean clover mottle virus towards development of a gene silencing vector</field><field name="creator">Fosu-Nyarko, John</field><field name="description">Subterranean clover mottle virus (SCMoV) is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that infects subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and a number of related legume species. The ultimate aim of this research was to investigate aspects of SCMoV that would support its use as a gene silencing vector for legume species, since RNA (gene) silencing is now a potential tool for studylng gene function. The ability of viruses to induce an antiviral defense system is being explored by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), in which engmeered viral genomes are used as vectors to introduce genes or gene ii-agments to understand the function of endogenous genes by silencing them. To develop a gene silencing vector, a number of aspects of SCMoV host range and molecular biology needed to be studied.
 
 A requirement for a useful viral vector is a suitably wide host range. Hence the first part of this work involved study of the host range and symptom development of SCMoV in a range of leguminous and non-leguminous plants. The aim of this work was to identify new and most suitable hosts among economically important crop and model legumes for functional genomic studies, and also to study symptom development in these hosts for comparison with host responses to any SCMoV-based viral vectors that might be used in later infection studies. A total of 61 plant genotypes representing 52 species from 25 different genera belonging to 7 families were examined for their response to SCMoV infection, including established and new crop legumes, established pasture, and novel pasture and forage legumes, and 12 host indicator plants belonging to the families Amaranthaceae, Apiaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cruciferae, Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae. Following mechanical inoculation, plants were examined for symptoms and tested for primary and secondary infection by RT-PCR andlor ELISA after 2-3 weeks and 3-9 weeks, respectively. Thirty-six legume hosts belonging to eight different genera of legumes were identified as suitable hosts of SCMoV, 22 of them systemic hosts and 15 were infected locally. Only two non-legumes were infected with SCMoV-P23, one systemically and one as a local host, so confirming that SCMoV is essentially a legume-infecting virus. This work considerably expanded knowledge of the host range of SCMoV.
 
 To provide the information needed to modify the SCMoV genome to develop gene vectors, the virus was characterized in detail. The complete genomes of four isolates, SCMoV-AL, SCMoV-MB, SCMoV-MJ and SCMoV-pFL, were sequenced using high fidelity RT-PCR and molecular cloning, and compared to the first sequenced isolate (SCMoV-P23) to give a complete picture of the genome organisation of the virus. The 4,258 nucleotide (nt) sequence of SCMoV RNA is not polyadenylated. The 5' non-coding region (NCR) is 68 nt in length and the 3' NCR is 174 nt. The coding regon contains four overlapping open reading fi-ames (ORFs). The first, OW1 (nt 68-608), encodes a putative protein containing 179 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass (Ma,) of 20.3 kDa. It overlaps with the next ORF, ORF2a, by four bases. ORF2a (nt 605-2347) encodes a putative protein of 580 amino acids with a Ma, of 63.7 kDa and contains a motif characteristic of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. The ORF2b is probably translated as part of a polyprotein by -1 ribosomal fiameshifting in ORF2a. The transfiame product (Ma, = 107.5 kDa) is made up of 966 amino acids. A GDD motif typical of RNA virus polymerases is present in ORF2b. The 3' terminal ORF3 (nt 3323-4084) encodes the 27.3 kDa coat protein (CP).
 
 Nucleotide variation between the complete sequences of the isolates was two to three orders of magnitude larger than base misincoporation rates of the polymerases used in RT-PCR. Molecular relationship analysis between all five isolates, undertaken with the complete nucleotide sequences, clearly separated them into three groups. These groups reflect similar significantly diverse groupings based on the symptoms and their severity in subterranean clover. Intra-isolate sequence variability is therefore a possible cause of the differences in symptom severity. The analysis also showed that there were more nucleotide substitutions at the 5' terminal half of SCMoV than at the 3' end. This observation was confirmed by the higher value of nucleotide diversities at nonsynonymous versus synonymous sites (dN/ds ratio) estimated for the ORF1, compared to the near conservation of sequences of the other ORFs. These results, together with functional and comparative sequence analysis with other sobemoviruses, implicate the ORFl gene product in pathogenicity of SCMoV, possibly as a severity determinant or as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing in plants.
 
 Because more information on SCMoV genome function was required, the possible involvement of the ORFl gene product (PI) and the CP in movement of SCMoV was studied in cells of grasspea (Lathyrus clymenum L) and chickpea as C-terminal fusion constructs with jellyfish (Aequorea victoriae) green fluorescent protein (GFP). A transient expression vector, pTEV, for in planta synthesis of reporter gene constructs was developed. The vector was based on pGEM-T with 35s RNA transcriptional promoter of Caulzjlower Mosaic virus (CaMV) and nopaline synthase gene transcription terminator signal (T-Nos) separated by a multiple subcloning site. A custom-made particle inflow gun was used to introduce the constructs into plant cells. The bombardment conditions were fxst optimised for efficient delivery of DNAcoated particles. Transient gene expression of GFP was monitored 24-96 hours after particle bombardment. Fluorescence from GFP alone, GFP:CP and GFP:Pl constructs was observed in the nucleus of single cells, cytoplasm and cell periphery of neighbouring cells. There was limited spread of these fusion proteins from one cell to another 36-48 hours after transformation. These results indicate that the P 1 and CP cannot move independently from cell to cell. Other viral/cellular components might be needed to form a complex with these proteins to transport the viral genome. Putative nuclear export signals in the P1 and CP sequences of SCMoV were identified by sequence comparison. These could be tested by mutagenesis using full-length infectious clones.
 
 To determine the possibility of gene expression of vectors based on SCMoV, three forms of a full-length cDNA clone of SCMoV-pFL were developed: one with no heterologous transcriptional factors (pFL), a second under the control of only 35s (p35SFL) and a third with 35s and T-Nos (pTEVFL). Fifteen day-old in vitro-cultured chickpea, grasspea and subterranean clover seedlings were inoculated by particle bombardment using gold particles coated with plasmid pTEVFL. In vivo-transcribed RNA transcripts were detected by RT-PCR after two weeks in grasspea but not in subterranean clover and chickpea.
 
 Experiments were undertaken towards developing the SCMoV genome into a VIGS vector. Three forms each of five major GFP chimeric constructs of pFL (the full length SCMoV cDNA clone) were generated from which in vitro- and in vivo-transcribed RNA transcripts could be derived. The rationale used in developing these constructs was gene insertion andlor replacement with d p , and duplication of the putative subgenomic RNA promoter (sgPro) of SCMoV. The major constructs were as follows: 
 * pFLCPgfp, pFL with the d p gene fused to the 3' end of the CP gene
 * pFLP1gfp, pFL with gj27 gene fused to the 3' end of the ORF 1, 
 * pFLCPsgprogfp, pFL with a putative sgPro sequence and a translatable and gene cloned in tandem between the CP gene and the 3' NCR of SCMoV, 
 * pFLCPVsgprogfp, pFL with a putative sgPro sequence and a translatable gfp gene cloned in tandem between a truncated CP gene and the 3' NCR and
 * pFLREPsgprogfp, pFL with the ORF2b, a putative sgPro sequence and a translatable gfP gene cloned in tandem between a truncated CP gene and the 3' NCR
 
 These constructs were all made, but a detailed assessment of their vector potential could not be done because there was a delay of about one year whilst the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator processed the application for permission for glasshouse testing. Although additional work needs to be undertaken to complete development of a final RNA silencing vector, this study has contributed to new knowledge in terms of extending understanding of SCMoV host range, symptoms, sequence variation and control of gene expression. The constructs made have also laid the groundwork for development of a legume gene silencing vector based on SCMoV.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/54/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of discouragement, anxiety and anger on pain: an examination of the role of endogenous opioids</field><field name="creator">Frew, Ashley Kim</field><field name="description">Animal research suggests that exposure to inescapable stressors can lead to an endogenous opioid-mediated form of pain inhibition, known as stress-induced analgesia (SIA). Similar results have been found with humans, although the literature is much less extensive and at times contradictory where uncontrollable stressors have led to an increase, rather than a decrease in pain. More recently, there has been some suggestion that emotions play an important role in pain modulation, and that particular negative moods are associated with opioid-mediated hypoalgesia. This research aimed to clarify the psychological (cognitive and affective) factors underlying endogenous opioid-mediated pain inhibition in humans. 
 
 The purpose of Study 1 was to examine the effects of stressor controllability and predictability on pain intensity (PI) and unpleasantness (UP) ratings during a cold pressor task (CPT) in 56 male and female subjects. The stressor involved a timed mental arithmetic task during which three moderately noxious electrical shocks were delivered. Although subjects were informed that shock delivery was contingent on math performance, the shock schedule was preset and identical across conditions. Perceived control over the shocks was manipulated between subjects by altering the difficulty of the math task. Shock predictability was manipulated by changing the colour of the computer screen to warn of an impending shock. Subjects were randomly allocated to four experimental conditions (controllable-predictable, controllable-unpredictable, uncontrollable-predictable, and uncontrollable-unpredictable shocks). Visual analogue ratings of 'perceived self-efficacy' (to avoid the shocks) and mood (anxiety, confusion, discouragement, anger, sluggishness, liveliness) were completed before, during and after the math task. Significantly greater discouragement and lower self-efficacy was reported in 'uncontrollable' conditions indicating that 'controllability' was manipulated effectively. Results indicated that a perceived lack of control over shocks during the math task led to significantly greater decreases in PI, but not UP, ratings during the last stages of a 4-minute fixed interval CPT after the math task. Shock predictability failed to influence subjective pain ratings alone; however, unpredictability interacted with lack of control to initially increase pain, followed by analgesia. Stress-induced increases in negative affect (anxiety, discouragement, anger) were associated with decreases in cold pressor PI, but with increased shock PI and UP during the math task. It was concluded that lack of control over an aversive event and negative affect led to SIA during a prolonged pain stimulus, whereas shock predictability had little influence 
 on pain. 
 
 In Study 2, 70 male and female subjects received either an opioid antagonist (naltrexone) or a placebo before the math task (using a double-blind, counterbalanced design), in order to determine the role of endogenous opioids in SIA. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions to investigate whether the shocks themselves may have contributed to analgesia observed after the math task: (1) easy task-few shocks, (2) hard task-few shocks, (3) hard task-many shocks. Increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), anxiety, anger and discouragement indicated that negative affect and sympathetic arousal were induced during the math task. Endogenous opioids inhibited the rise in anger, but not discouragement or anxiety, during the math task. There was some evidence that perceived lack of control over shocks, and not the shocks themselves, led to opioid-mediated decreases in cold pressor UP after the math task. In correlational analyses, discouraged subjects under opioid blockade reported more cold pressor UP after the math task than their placebo counterparts. However, this effect was not strong enough to reach statistical significance in regression analyses. Anxiety, anger, discouragement and lack of control over shocks increased shock PI and UP during the math task. 
 
 A growing body of research with normotensive subjects has linked increased cardiovascular activity with insensitivity to pain, but the role of endogenous opioids remains contentious. In addition to the investigations outlined above, Study 2 aimed to examine the contribution of endogenous opioids in the cardiovascular-pain relationship. However, there was no evidence of an interaction between pain and cardiovascular activity in this study.
 
 Study 3 was carried out to investigate opioid involvement in the effects of an uncontrollable stressor and stress-induced negative mood on cold pressor PI, UP and pain tolerance, and onset/thresholds of the nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII). Forty-three male and female subjects were administered either naltrexone or a placebo using a double-blind, counterbalanced design before completing a timed mental arithmetic stressor (identical to the 'hard task-many shocks' condition in Study 2). Increases in physiological (SBP, DBP) and affective measures (anxiety, anger and discouragement) indicated that the math task induced a marked state of stress. Negative affect increased shock PI and UP during the task, whereas self-efficacious subjects taking the placebo experienced less shock pain. However, uncontrollable stress led to an opioid-antagonised increase in cold pressor UP. Stressor controllability had a similar, but marginal, effect on cold pressor PI, but not pain tolerance. Tolerance of cold pressor pain was not associated with subjective PI and UP ratings, but was positively associated with endurance to non-painful, but unpleasant tasks (Valsalva Manoeuvre, Letter-Symbol Matching Task), indicating that pain tolerance was measuring the ability to tolerate discomfort, in addition to pain. Results of hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that increases in discouragement were positively related to increases in cold pressor UP after the math task, for naltrexone recipients only. These findings suggest that discouragement inhibits the UP of a prolonged pain stimulus via opioid mechanisms. RIII latencies and thresholds were not affected by the math task or by opioid blockade; however, these null effects may be due to methodological limitations. Unlike Study 2, higher blood pressure was associated with shock and cold pressor pain inhibition in normotensive subjects, and this relationship appeared to be mediated by opioids.
 
 The strong association between chronic pain and depression has led to speculation that the endogenous opioid system and pain modulatory mechanisms may be impaired in depression. At the time that this research was carried out, no studies had examined whether this was the case. In Study 4, the effect of a cognitive stressor (math task used in Study 3) on foot cold pressor PI, UP and pain tolerance and the nociceptive, or R2 component, of the blink reflex was investigated in 61 participants with or without major depression (as met by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and confirmed by psychometric testing). Naltrexone or placebo was administered to subjects an hour before the math task using a double-blind, counterbalanced design. Increases in physiological (SBP, DBP) and affective measures (anxiety, anger and discouragement) confirmed that the math task induced the targeted emotional state. An opioid-mediated reduction in anxiety occurred mid-way through the math task. Opioid-mediated decreases in foot cold pressor PI and UP were observed in depressed and non-depressed subjects after the math task. R2 onset to 10 mA was facilitated after the task regardless of opioid blockade, suggesting that endogenous opioids are not involved in the modulation of the BR. Increased anxiety and discouragement led to opioid-mediated inhibition of shock PI and UP during the task and, to a lesser extent, foot cold pressor PI and UP after the math task. Anger increased shock pain without being influenced by opioid blockade. Pain tolerance was not influenced by depression, opioid blockade or mood. These findings failed to support the idea that SIA is impaired in major depression, suggesting instead that uncontrollable aversive events and negative mood (anxiety, discouragement) lead to opioid activation and insensitivity to acute pain. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the inverse relationship between resting blood pressure and foot cold pressor PI and UP was opioid-mediated in controls only, suggesting that opioid dysregulation in depression might influence regulatory functions other than SIA. 
 
 In Study 4, opioid involvement in hetero-segmental pain inhibitory phenomena termed diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) was examined separately, before psychological stress. Specifically, the effect of a heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulus (CS i.e., hand CPT) on R2 onset latency was compared before and after drug absorption (before the math task). An inhibitory effect of the first CS was detected at each electrical stimulus intensity consistent with a DNIC effect. However, this effect was not detected during the second CS, suggesting that some other process masked the DNIC effect. 
 
 In summary, the findings indicate that uncontrollable aversive events and negative emotion (primarily discouragement) activates endogenous opioids and inhibits pain in human subjects, whether depressed or not. Notably, opioids inhibited the affective component of pain perception, or pain UP, more consistently than PI, suggesting that the antinociceptive function of opioids may be secondary to an important emotional-modulatory role. Endogenous opioids also appeared to mediate the cardiovascular-pain relationship in normotensive non-depressed subjects, suggesting an important stress-regulatory role for these peptides. Opioid-mediated masking of this relationship in major depression suggests that functioning of the endogenous opioid system may be impaired in baroreceptor-mediated analgesia. This finding provides preliminary support for the notion that opioid antinociceptive system dysfunction may contribute to cardiovascular disease in depression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/55/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorising the gift through visual culture</field><field name="creator">Fuery, Kelli Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the gift in terms of presence and interpretation using varied examples of image that form a visual culture. It contextualises the term giftness by analysing its use and our socio-cultural understanding of its function as it relates to the gift process. The hermeneutic processes attached to both the gift, and gifting, are multifarious and require examination of moments of instability present in the act of interpretation and meaning. The gift relationship is juxtaposed against the relationship between image and reader/observer to highlight the abstract quality of the gift and its inherent instability that exists within gift interpretation in general.
 
 The fundamental structure and unity of the gift, as is based upon relations between subjects, helps to identify and analyse systems of power and subjectivity developed in terms of investment in order to emphasise the complexities that arise through inter-subjective relations, particularly gift exchange, and those between subject and image. Certain theoretical models help to exemplify and illuminate this thesis, predominantly post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories. The gift's condition of instability is further examined in terms of discursive formation and function, looking at how the gift is enunciated so that one can recognise a gift and giving, and acknowledge its problematic status. The relationship between subject and image is investigated to see if we are able to read this investment as a gift relationship within the context of giftness, that is when giftness operates as an instable and challenging element to discursive exchange in visual mediums such as film, painting, television, art and photography. An examination of the gift aporia in this thesis is directed towards a subject's investment in the image. What transpires between subject and image is akin to what circulates between giver and receiver, on the basis of investment. On this basis, the present configuration of giftness is utilised in terms of the image.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/56/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of sudden death in cultivated proteas from the Southwest of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Dunne, Christopher Philip</field><field name="description">Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands is a common and devastating pathogen of cultivated proteas worldwide.  Webb (1997) described a Sudden Death plant disease of proteas in Western Australia (WA) protea plantations.  Proteas that suffer the syndrome display symptoms such as stunted growth, wilting, chlorosis and often death.  In the current study, a number of protea plantations in the southwest of WA were visited to quantify the extent that P. cinnamomi was attributing to deaths of cultivated proteas.  The survey indicated that P. cinnamomi is the major cause of Sudden Death in proteas.  A range of other fungi (Fusarium, Botryosphaeria, Pestalotiopsis, Alternaria) and pests (nematodes, mealy bug, scale insects) were also identified to be contributing to protea death and decline in WA plantations.  In many cases the factors contributing to protea disease appeared complex, with a range of physical factors or nutritional imbalances commonly associated with these pathogens and pests.  As P. cinnamomi was the major cause of death of cultivated proteas the remainder of the experiments described in this dissertation investigated its control in horticultural plantings.  
 
 Biofumigation has the potential to become an important technique in an overall integrated management approach to P. cinnamomi.  In this thesis, biofumigation refers to the suppression of pathogens and pests by the incorporation of Brassica plants into the soil.  Two biofumigants (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern., B. napus L.) were screened for their effect on the in vitro growth of five common Phytophthora species (P. cinnamomi, P. cactorum (Lebert and Colin) Schroeter., P. citricola Sawada, P. cryptogea Pethyb. and Laff. and P. megasperma Drechsler).  Growth was determined by the measuring dry weight and radial growth of vegetative hyphae.  B. juncea was found to be superior in its suppressive effect compared to B. napus.  There was also significant variation in the sensitivity of the Phytophthora species to the suppressive effects of the biofumigants.  P. cinnamomi was the most sensitive of the five species investigated.  Where the rates of the biofumigant were sufficient to suppress growth of Phytophthora, the suppressive effect was mostly fungicidal. 
 
 To determine how B. juncea and B. napus affect the infective ability and survival of  P. cinnamomi, their effects on sporangia and chlamydospores production in soil was investigated in vitro.  P. cinnamomi colonised Miracloth discs were added to soil amended with the two Brassica species, before being removed every two days over an eight day period for the determination of sporangia production, chlamydospore production and infective ability.  Only the soils amended with B. juncea significantly reduced sporangia production in P. cinnamomi.  Both Brassica species increased the percentage of aborted or immature sporangia and reduced the infective ability of the pathogen.  Neither Brassica species had any effect on zoospore release or chlamydospore production in P. cinnamomi.  
 
 Soil cores and soil leachate were collected from biofumigant-amended field soils to determine the inoculum potential and infective ability of the pathogen under glasshouse conditions.  Amending the soil with both Brassica species had an immediate suppressive effect on the inoculum potential and infective ability of the P. cinnamomi.  However, after this initial suppression there was a gradual increase in the recovery of the pathogen over the monitoring period of four weeks.  To determine if the suppression would result in decreased disease incidence in a susceptible host, Lupinus angustifolius L. seeds were planted in the biofumigant amended soil.   B. juncea amended soils reduced the disease incidence of P. cinnamomi by 25%.  B. napus had no effect on disease incidence in L. angustifolius.
 
 Although the current study had demonstrated that biofumigants could suppress the growth, sporulation and infection of P. cinnamomi, it was unclear if this would equate to a reduction in disease incidence when applied in the field.  A field trial was conducted on a protea plantation in the southwest of Western Australia that compared biofumigation with B. juncea to chemical fumigation (metham sodium) and soil solarisation.  The three soil treatments were used in an integrated management approach to control P. cinnamomi that included the use of a hardwood compost, mulch and water sterilisation.  All treatments were monitored during their application to ensure the treatments were conducted successfully.  The three soil treatments significantly reduced the recovery of the pathogen and the infective ability of the pathogen to a soil depth of 20 cm.  Metham sodium was the most suppressive soil treatment and soil solarisation was the least suppressive treatment.  Only the metham sodium treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of root rot in Leucadendron salignum P.J. Bergius x laureolum (Lam.) Fourc (c.v. Safari Sunset) over the monitoring period of three years.  
 
 Another field trial was conducted on the same protea plantation to compare the effectiveness of B. juncea and B. napus, without the use of other control strategies, to reduce the incidence of P. cinnamomi infection of Leucadendron Safari Sunset.  The concentration of isothiocyanates was monitored for seven days after the incorporation of the biofumigants.  Although both Brassica species reduced the recovery and infective ability of the pathogen, neither biofumigant reduced the incidence of root rot in Leucadendron Safari Sunset.
 
 In conclusion, P. cinnamomi is the most common and devastating pathogen in WA protea plantations.  The current study demonstrated that P. cinnamomi is sensitive to the suppressive nature of biofumigants. Biofumigants can suppress the in vitro growth, sporulation, infective ability of P. cinnamomi and reduce the incidence of the disease caused by the pathogen in the glasshouse.  Of the two Brassica species investigated,  B. juncea was superior in its ability to control P. cinnamomi compared to B. napus.  When applied in the field, biofumigation using B. juncea was found to be more suppressive that soil solarisation, but not as effective as metham sodium.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/57/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing a relational worldview: Watershed Torbay, Western Australia - connecting community and place</field><field name="creator">Duxbury, Marie-Louise</field><field name="description">The Australian landcare movement is considered to be a major success, with an extensive community landcare network developed, raised levels and depth of awareness, and a range of demonstration projects undertaken.  It has inspired people across Australia and has been emulated overseas.  However, negative trends in environmental conditions continue unabated. If the approach of the Australian landcare movement to date has not addressed the current unsustainable farming practices, what approach will?
 
 This Australian study explores the history of the 'mechanistic' worldview, its influence on the attitudes to and treatment of landscapes and indigenous knowledge from colonisation, and the ongoing impacts on current social and natural rural landscapes.  Increasing tension between the mechanistic worldview and the growing landcare ethic based on relationships is apparent.
 
 Through the focus project, Watershed Torbay, a different way of seeing and treating the world is explored by praxis.  A worldview based on relationships and connection as the end purpose is proffered.  Strengthening connection with one's own moral framework, and relationships with people and place in community, are seen as the path to achieving sustainability based on ecological and values rationality.
 
 It is recognised that there are multiple ways of seeing and experiencing the world, and it is important to give voice to all players with a connection to decision making.  This also means that there are different forms of knowledge; these can be grouped under the typology of epistemic or scientific knowledge, techne or technical/practical capability, and the central form of knowledge about values and interests.
 
 I have worked with the focus project as a reflective practitioner undertaking action research; this is evident in the movement between theory and practice through the thesis.  The thesis concludes in praxis taking the learning from the focus project, and exploration of theory, to answer the question posed at the outset by outlining how the relational worldview can be applied to the regional bodies now delivering major landcare programs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/58/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating porcine and feline zona pellucida as immunocontraceptive antigens in the female domestic cat</field><field name="creator">Eade, Jocye A.</field><field name="description">Immunocontraception, or contraception mediated by the immune system, is being widely studied as an alternative, humane form of population control. The induction of an immune response against a specific component of the mammalian oocyte, termed zona pellucida (ZP) has been shown to be an effective immunocontraceptive in several species. Comparatively little work has been done investigating the use of ZP antigens in the domestic cat. This study aimed to investigate porcine ZP(B+C) and feline ZPA, B and C as immunogens in the domestic cat, and further to elucidate their effects on reproduction. Immunisation of female cats with porcine ZP(B+C) failed to elicit a detectable antibody response as assessed by ELISA, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, there was no effect on the structure of the ovaries nor on breeding performance. Feline ZPA, B and C were cloned into the pkCMVint.polyli mammalian expression vector and used to immunise female cats. ELISA revealed that immunisation with either pkCMVint.fZP(B+C) or pkCMVint.fZPA DNA (Treated) resulted in a low-level circulating antibody response, which was apparently short-lived. Immunoblotting did not reveal any common pattern of recognition of antigenic polypeptides between responding animals. Ovaries from fZP Treated animals, however, showed antibody binding specifically on the ZP of follicles from late primary / early secondary, through to antral stages. Despite the antibody binding, the overall structure of the ovaries remained unaffected in all but two of the fZP Treated cats. Two fZPA immunised cats exhibited ovaries that had no recognisable follicular structures, however, the observed abnormalities could not be conclusively linked to fZPA immunisation. Overall, a significant lymphoproliferative response was shown in fZP Treated cats when compared with Controls. Fertility was not significantly affected in fZP Treated cats, although there was a tendency towards increased incidence of unsuccessful matings or pregnancies. The fZP DNA preparations studied here exhibit potential as an immunocontraceptive, with the ability to generate a lymphoproliferative response against fZP and elicit antibodies specifically recognizing fZP in situ. Further studies should continue to investigate the immunogenicity of, and characterise the immune response against, such fZP DNA preparations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/59/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linked social-ecological systems: a case study of the resilience of the Western Australian agricultural region</field><field name="creator">Allison, Helen E.</field><field name="description">In the Western Australian agricultural region, an area of approximately 14 million hectares (70,000 square miles), widespread areas of native vegetation have been cleared and replaced with annual cropping systems, predominantly wheat. Only 1.3 million hectares (10%) of small and scattered native vegetation remnants remain. By 2000 16% of land in the region was at risk from soil salinity and was largely unproductive for commercial agriculture. A new hydrological equilibrium affecting 33% of the Western Australian agricultural region is predicted to be reached between 2050 and 2300. The starting premise of this dissertation is that normal disciplinary science was adopted as the dominant intellectual influence on natural resource management policy and thus natural resource degradation was treated as a problem for science, extracted from its social,  economic and historical contexts. The second premise of this dissertation is that natural resource problems are not isolated scientific or technical problems, and are exacerbated by human failure to predict the complex inter-relationships among the social, ecological and economic systems.
 
 This dissertation initially provides an analytical narrative on the Western Australian agricultural region between 1889 and 2003 (114 years) with the main finding being that in the years pre-1970 a development-driven Western Australian Government was responsible for extensive land clearing for agriculture, often contrary to scientific advice. In the 1980s and 1990s the severity and extent of soil salinity and the prognosis of future negative trends in other natural resource indicators caused a rapid proliferation and evolution of Federal and State policies designed to 'solve the problem'. Nonetheless many natural resource problems remain intractable. The second part of the dissertation investigates the epistemology of the normal science paradigm as it was applied to natural resource management problems in the 20th century as a potentially contributing cause. The evolution of an alternative epistemology, post-normal science paradigm, is then examined for explicating our current understanding of 'reality'. A research framework was constructed which defines the post-normal science paradigm; the systemic approach; the bodies of theory-organisational, ecology, resilience and system dynamics theory; the social-ecological system perspective; and the methods-resilience analysis and system dynamics. This framework provides a novel way in which to gain a greater understanding of the fundamental or root causes of natural resource management problems. Using the case study of the Western Australian agricultural region a dynamic model was constructed based on descriptive information. An examination of the historical events and processes of the Western Australian agricultural region reveals that over a 114-year history it has evolved through two interactions of the adaptive cycle. Further investigation reveals these two cycles were synchronous with the second and third economic long-wave cycles or Kondratiev Cycles, that show the behaviour over time of the evolution of modern industrial societies. The model suggests that the reasons for the dynamic behaviour of the Western Australian agricultural region lie in the interaction of the three production growth drivers of the international commodity system, which have resulted in a pathological system, the 'Lock-in Trap'. Increased total commodity production, reinvestment and declining prices in real terms have tended to produce the unintended negative impacts of resource decline, environmental pollution and rural population decline. I suggest that the expansion of thresholds through the reinvestment in technology is a principle reason why there has not yet been a profound collapse of exploited renewable resources in the Western Australian agricultural region. Regional natural resource management strategies will need to take account of not only spatial cross-scale issues, in particular the linkages between the individual farmer and the international commodity system, but also the temporal variables, in particular the slowly emerging changes in ecological/physical variables, such as the hydrological cycle. 
 
 This research can help to provide the information and heuristic metaphors to encourage natural resource policy makers to take long-term and whole system perspectives. It includes a powerful set of tools for communicating dynamic processes in an integrated method to inform policy and management decisions. The ideas in this interdisciplinary research are essential for making science relevant within a social and ecological context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/60/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and hydrology of a threatened groundwater-dependent ecosystem: the Jewel Cave karst system in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Eberhard, Stefan</field><field name="description">Groundwater is a significant component of the world's water balance and accounts for &gt;90 % of usable freshwater. Around the world groundwater is an important source of water for major cities, towns, industries, agriculture and forestry. Groundwater plays a role in the ecological processes and 'health' of many surface ecosystems, and is the critical habitat for subterranean aquatic animals (stygofauna). Over-abstraction or contamination of groundwater resources may imperil the survival of stygofauna and other groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs). In two karst areas in Western Australia (Yanchep and Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge), rich stygofauna communities occur in cave waters containing submerged tree roots. These aquatic root mat communities were listed as critically endangered because of declining groundwater levels, presumably caused by lower rainfall, groundwater abstraction, and/or forest plantations. Investigation of the hydrology and ecology of the cave systems was considered essential for the conservation and recovery of these threatened ecological communities (TECs). This thesis investigated the hydrology and ecology of one of the TECs, located in the Jewel Cave karst system in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge. A multi-disciplinary approach was used to explore aspects pertinent to the hydrology and ecology of the groundwater system.
 
 Thermoluminescence dating of the limestone suggested that development of the karst system dates from the Early Pleistocene and that caves have been available for colonisation by groundwater fauna since that time. Speleogenesis of the watertable maze caves occurred in a flank margin setting during earlier periods of wetter climate and/or elevated base levels. Field mapping and leveling were used to determine hydrologic relationships between caves and the boundaries of the karst aquifer. Monitoring of groundwater levels was undertaken to characterise the conditions of recharge, storage, flow and discharge. A hydrogeologic model of the karst system was developed.
 
 The groundwater hydrograph for the last 50 years was reconstructed from old photographs and records whilst radiometric dating and leveling of stratigraphic horizons enabled reconstruction of a history of watertable fluctuations spanning the Holocene to Late Pleistocene. The watertable fluctuations over the previous 50 years did not exceed the range of fluctuations experienced in the Quaternary history, including a period 11,000 to 13,000 years ago when the watertable was lower than the present level.
 
 The recent groundwater decline in Jewel Cave was not reflected in the annual rainfall trend, which was above average during the period (1976 to 1988) when the major drop in water levels occurred. Groundwater abstraction and tree plantations in nearby catchments have not contributed to the groundwater decline as previously suggested. The period of major watertable decline coincided with a substantial reduction in fire frequency within the karst catchment. The resultant increase in understorey vegetation and ground litter may have contributed to a reduction in groundwater recharge, through increased evapotranspiration and interception of rainfall. To better understand the relationships between rainfall, vegetation and fire and their effects on groundwater recharge, an experiment is proposed that involves a prescribed burn of the cave catchment with before-after monitoring of rainfall, leaf-area, ground litter, soil moisture, vadose infiltration and groundwater levels.
 
 Molecular genetic techniques (allozyrne electrophoresis and mitochondria1 DNA) were used to assess the species and population boundaries of two genera and species of cave dwelling Amphipoda. Populations of both species were largely panrnictic which was consistent with the hydrogeologic model. The molecular data supported the conclusion that both species of amphipod have survived lower watertable levels experienced in the caves during the Late Pleistocene. A mechanism for the colonization and isolation of populations in caves is proposed.
 
 Multi Dimensional Scaling was used to investigate patterns in groundwater biodiversity including species diversity, species assemblages, habitat associations and biogeography. Faunal patterns were related to abiotic environmental parameters. Investigation of hydrochemistry and water quality characterized the ecological water requirements (EWR) of the TEC and established a baseline against which to evaluate potential impacts such as groundwater pollution.
 
 The conservation status of the listed TEC was significantly improved by increasing the number of known occurrences and distribution range of the community (from 10 m2 to &gt; 2 x lo6 m2), and by showing that earlier perceived threatening processes (rainfall decline, groundwater pumping, tree plantations) were either ameliorated or inoperative within this catchment. The GDE in the Jewel Cave karst system may not have been endangered by the major phase of watertable decline experienced 1975-1987, or by the relatively stable level experienced up until 2000. However, if the present trend of declining rainfall in southwest Wester,,Australia continues, and the cave watertable declines &gt; 0.5 m below the present level, then the GDE may become more vulnerable to extinction.
 
 The occurrence and distribution of aquatic root mat communities and related groundwater fauna in other karst catchments in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge is substantially greater than previously thought, however some of these are predicted to be threatened by groundwater pumping and pollution associated with increasing urban and rural developments. The taxonomy of most stygofauna taxa and the distribution of root mat communities is too poorly known to enable proper assessment of their conservation requirements. A regional-scale survey of stygofauna in southwest Western Australia is required to address this problem. In the interim, conservation actions for the listed TECs need to be focused at the most appropriate spatial scale, which is the karst drainage system and catchment area. Conservation of GDEs in Western Australia will benefit fi-om understanding and integration with abiotic groundwater system processes, especially hydrogeologic and geomorphic processes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/61/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of systematic controllability assessment for process control designs</field><field name="creator">Ekawati, Estiyanti</field><field name="description">Chemical process industries are constantly challenged to operate profitably and efficiently, despite the presence of significant uncertainties and disturbances on the operational conditions, and various operational limitations. The capability to meet the challenge relies on the quality of process control design, which should integrate the dynamic controllability characteristics in addition to the traditional economic considerations.
 
 The focus of this thesis is the development of a systematic controllability assessment framework for process control design. The framework addresses the controllability aspects in process and controller structures, as well as in time-domain dynamic performances. The aim is to provide clearer relationships between process profitability, controllability, and operational switching strategies in response to variations in the operating conditions.
 
 The skeleton of the framework is a mathematical optimisation algorithm. This algorithm considers the structural, operational and economic problems arising in process control design as a progressive, dynamic, and uncertain semi-infinite mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. The algorithm is an iterative, two-level optimisation, which determines the optimum process design and the associated controllability index within an optimisation window. The window progresses along a time horizon, ensuring optimal process design within the window while accommodating the design switching during the course of load variations in a larger time horizon.
 
 The controllability index quantifies the design capability to satisfy a given economic objective. Unique to other existing approaches, the process controllability index is computed based on the multi-dimensional geometric representation of the disturbances and uncertainties, measured process dynamics, and feasible operating spaces. These representations account for variable interactions existing in a multivariable process operation, in contrast to separate quantification in traditional single variable assessments.
 
 The geometric computation of the index requires the analysis and elimination of redundant measurement variables, which occur in different combinations at different process and controller structures. The redundancy is detected and eliminated based on statistical collinearity among the process data, allowing the assessment to focus on the retained functional variables and the associated critical disturbances and uncertainties.
 
 The redundancy analysis is tailored with a dynamic mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solver, which is dedicated to select the optimum process and controller structure within the design. The solver is developed based on the branch and bound strategy over the design tree, which consists of alternative nonlinear programming (NLP) sub-problems. In addition to the redundancy analysis, the solver is equipped with a compact MINLP formulation, an alternating depth-first and breadth-first search strategy,  sub-problems. The tailored strategy ensures fast and efficient convergence of convex problems, as well as superior optimum of non-convex counterparts.
 
 Finally, the framework is performed within a time window, which progresses along the time horizon. This strategy provides realistic responses to major variations along greater length of time, by switching between optimum operational modes, while maintaining the optimum process controllability.
 
 The performance of the framework is illustrated through several case studies. Each case demonstrates the novelty of addressing various computational features in a concise algorithm. These include the industrial case, which involves the systematic controllability assessment of an industrial five-effect liquor-burning evaporator within an Alumina refinery, which highlights the contribution of this framework in bridging the process design methodologies with the industrial implementation. The thesis consists of eight chapters, presenting the systematic development of the framework. The numerical implementations have been organised in a MATLAB Toolbox, accompanied with the relevant case studies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/62/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You look normal to me: the social construction of disability in Australian national cinema in the 1990s</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Kathleen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the social construction of disability in Australian national cinema throughout the 1990s. During that decade, disability was an issue that remained in the background of many film narratives and is (still) under-theorised in academic scholarship. Disability continues to be tangential to many social critiques, particularly in relation to cultural diversity and national identity. When it is foregrounded, as in Liz Ferrier's (2001) work, its theoretical premise is chiefly located in a damaged body, rather than examined through the lens of cultural construction.
 
 The growing number of culturally diverse filmmakers in the Australian film industry during the 1990s initiated a critical focus on diversity, multiculturalism and minority group interests. However, an examination of the social construction of disability is conspicuously absent. I argue that a disability identity that focuses attention away from the body and onto society should be incorporated into notions of diversity concerning Australian national cinema. In this thesis I investigate both thematic and stylistic representations of disability with reference to socio-political contexts and influences. A disability identity - as it is included or excluded from Australian national identity - is explored through a variety of close readings of local films. I examine the methods filmmakers employ to problematise diversity in relation to the limitations of dominant representations of disability.
 
 This thesis recognises the historical lack of scholarship in relation to disability as a diversity issue in Australian national cinema of the 1990s and is an attempt to open up this field to new modes of criticism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/63/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Our daily bread: the field bakery and the Anzac legend</field><field name="creator">Etcell, Pamela M.</field><field name="description">The First World War and the Australian Imperial Force have generated thousands of books and articles. Many studies adhere to the emphasis of C.E.W. Bean, and recount the history of the infantry or a particular infantry battalion. Others examine both the short term and long-lasting effects of the war on the Australian psyche. Some historians have acknowledged that a particular group of non-fighting combatants has been neglected, but generally, this group has been employed in dangerous and difficult pursuits. Very few historians have studied the roles of non-fighting combatants whose contribution is considered as lacklustre, such as the Australian Field Bakeries. 
 
 When I began my research, I could not understand why the Australian Field Bakeries did not play any part in the historiography of World War One. An examination of the Anzac legend revealed an emphasis on the characteristics of the Anzac, especially masculinity and heroism. I argue that the bakers' employment might be considered as being situated within the woman's sphere and therefore unmasculine, whilst that same employment did not offer the chance for acts of heroism. Because of an emphasis on the exciting exploits of the infantry within Anzac historiography, the Australian Field Bakeries and their role as support troops have been ignored and omitted.
 
 Comparing demographic statistics and the war experiences, values and attitudes of the Australian Imperial Force and the bakers, I conclude that the bakers of the Australian Field Bakeries were extraordinarily similar to the men of the Australian Imperial Force. Only those experiences and statistics directly related to the two groups' specific fields of employment are significantly different. I argue that specialised skills and a perceived lack of masculinity and heroism have seen the men of the Australian Field Bakeries excluded from all existing Anzac historiography.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/64/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulating internet pornography as an issue of sex discrimination</field><field name="creator">Evans, Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis will critically analyse Australia's censorship laws with a specific focus on the regulation of pornography distributed via the internet, a means of mass production and distribution of pornography.
 
 It will be argued that Australia's current censorship laws are deficient because their focus is morality based.  A morality based approach does not take into account what pornography is and does; in particular, the sex equality harms to real women  and the inequality within society caused by pornography.  
 
 This thesis will argue that the current censorship regime is an ineffective means of regulating internet pornography because it fails to address the complexities of internet regulation and the selling and marketing of sexual inequality online.  This thesis will also argue that these censorship laws have had little or no impact in reducing the availability of pornography distributed via the internet.  
 
 This thesis argues that a civil rights/equal opportunity approach to pornographic harm, as proposed by the anti-pornography civil rights ordinance drafted by American feminists Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin  (the ordinance), should be adopted into Australian law.  The ordinance will be examined with a particular focus on how it can be amended and incorporated into Australian equal opportunity legislation in order to more effectively regulate the distribution of pornography via the internet in a manner that addresses the harms to social inequality caused by pornography.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/65/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of fire on the honey possum Tarsipes rostratus in the Fitzgerald River National Park, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Everaardt, Annika</field><field name="description">The honey possum Tarsipes rostratus is a tiny (7 - 12 g) highly specialised flower-feeding marsupial endemic to the south-western corner of Australia.  The impact of fire on this small mammal was studied, over a 19-year period, in the Fitzgerald River National Park, a large (330,000 ha) area of relatively undisturbed heathland/shrubland, rich in the proteaceous and myrtaceous plants upon which the honey possum appears to rely for food.  The honey possum is the most abundant and widespread mammal in this Park.   
 
 Capture rates of honey possums were significantly related to the years since the vegetation was last burnt, annual rainfall in the preceding (but not the current) year, the season when trapping occurred, and the trapping grid operated.  Capture rates declined markedly after fire and remained low (less than one third of those in long unburnt vegetation) for about 4 - 5 years following a fire.  Rates of capture then increased steadily over the next 20 - 25 years, with maximal abundance recorded about 30 years after fire.  Thereafter, there appeared to be a slight decline in capture rates, but even in the vegetation unburnt for longest (&gt; 50 years since fire), honey possum abundance was substantial and relatively stable.  In contrast to these changes in abundance, the structure of the honey possum population, with 79 % adults and 57 % males, appeared little influenced by fire history, annual rainfall, season or grid.  
 
 The increase in the rates of capture of honey possums following fire paralleled the pattern of availability of cover in the vertical and, to a lesser extent, horizontal plane.  Indeed, projective foliage cover took around 20 years after fire to reach levels similar to those available in areas unburnt for even longer.  The trend in capture rates was also congruent with the maturation of the most frequently visited foodplants of honey possums, particularly Banksia nutans (summer flowering) and B. baueri (winter flowering).  Areas long unburnt still contained shelter and foodplants adequate for honey possums even 50 years or more after fire, with only slight evidence of senescence.
 
 Pollen loads indicated that honey possums caught in burnt areas, where their preferred foodplants were absent, continued to feed on these favoured foodplants (Banksia and Dryandra spp.) at nearby unburnt areas.  In addition, they also fed, in both burnt and long unburnt areas, upon a suite of other plant species that regenerated more rapidly from lignotubers and epicormic buds, as well as from seeds (e.g. Eucalyptus and Calothamnus spp.).  Thus, honey possums appeared to persist with their preferences for feeding from a limited number of flowering plants despite some of these species not being available in recently burnt areas for many years.  Nearby patches of unburnt vegetation can clearly be important refuges, feeding grounds and shelter for the few honey possums that visit recently burnt areas, and appear to be the source of honey possum colonists in the years following a fire.  
 
 Capture rates were also greater following years when rainfall was higher than average.  Indeed, rainfall had as great an influence upon capture rates as time since fire.  Capture rates were also consistently higher over winter, and to a lesser extent over summer, than in either autumn or spring.  Individual grids, even those close together in apparently similar vegetation with a similar fire history, still differed significantly overall in their capture rates of honey possums.  This last finding has implications for the use of chronosequences in the study of post-fire changes in biota.
 
 Although not the primary focus of the study, data on the limited suite of other, far less abundant, small mammals present indicated that house mouse Mus musculus domesticus numbers peak soon after fire (about two years after fire), grey-bellied dunnart Sminthopsis griseoventer numbers somewhat later (about eight years after fire) and that southern bush rats Rattus fuscipes fiuscipes, like honey possums, are later successional species.  Most species were present in vegetation over a range of post-fire ages, with data consistent with models based on sequential changes in relative abundance.
 
 Like many Australian mammals, the range of the honey possum has contracted substantially over the last 200 years and the coastal heathlands of the south-west are its last stronghold.  In terms of its conservation, this study indicates that, if possible, management burns in these heathlands should be separated by intervals of at least 20 years between successive burns, and preferably even longer.  If burns are required more frequently to meet other management priorities, it is highly preferable that they are small and patchy, rather than large scale.  Such practices may help ensure the long-term survival of this unique, highly specialised and endemic marsupial.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/66/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards eradication of SPAM: a study on intelligent adaptive SPAM filters</field><field name="creator">Hassan, Tarek</field><field name="description">As the massive increase of electronic mail (email) usage continues, SPAM (unsolicited bulk email), has continued to grow because it is a very inexpensive method of advertising. These unwanted emails can cause a serious problem by filling up the email inbox and thereby leaving no space for legitimate emails to pass through. Currently the only defense against SPAM is the use of SPAM filters. A novel SPAM filter GetEmail5 along with the design rationale, is described in this thesis. To test the efficacy of GetEmail5 SPAM filter, an experimental setup was created and a commercial bulk email program was used to send SPAM and non-SPAM emails to test the new SPAM filter. 
 
 GetEmail5's efficiency and ability to detect SPAM was compared against two highly ranked commercial SPAM filters on different sets of emails, these included all SPAM, non-SPAM, and mixed emails, also text and HTML emails.
 
 The results showed the superiority of GetEmail5 compared to the two commercial SPAM filters in detecting SPAM emails and reducing the user's involvement in categorizing the incoming emails.  
 
 This thesis demonstrates the design rationale for GetEmail5 and also its greater effectiveness in comparison with the commercial SPAM filters tested.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/67/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cold hearts versus bleeding hearts: disciplinary differences in university students' sociopolitical orientations</field><field name="creator">Hastie, Brianne</field><field name="description">The supposed liberalising effects of higher education have been documented since Newcomb's landmark Bennington study in the 1930s. However, other research has suggested that the effect of education on beliefs and values may differ between academic disciplines. The main mechanisms by which differing beliefs are believed to develop include the self-selection hypothesis (where students chose disciplines which match their pre-existing belief systems) and the socialisation hypothesis (where students are socialised into the worldview of the discipline through continued exposure). Three correlational design questionnaire studies were conducted. Study 1 and 2 featured 223 and 531 students, respectively, and Study 3 included 143 recent graduates of Murdoch University, from different academic disciplines (primarily commerce, psychology and the social sciences). Study 4 involved interviews with nine students who had switched between the three main fields of study. The quantitative results generally supported the self-selection hypothesis, although some participant accounts suggested possible accentuation effects (where pre-existing values were strengthened by university study). Future research should consider a longitudinal study, tracking students in different academic disciplines over the full-length of their degree. A cross-sectional community study would also be valuable, in determining whether large scale difference exist between the those with tertiary, compared to those with lower levels of education, and whether discipline differences persist following graduation (and whether this is linked to occupation). These findings have important implications for the way universities view themselves, in terms of shaping the minds of the next generation of leaders, and for disciplines, in terms of the types of students they attract and how they can best retain them. In conclusion, there are significant differences in the belief systems of students in different academic disciplines, although not as large as may be expected, and that this seems primarily due to self-selection, rather than socialisation or accentuation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/68/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masculinities and whiteness: the shaping of adolescent male students' subjectivities in an Australian boys' school</field><field name="creator">Hatchell, Helen</field><field name="description">In my thesis I explore way in which adolescent male students negotiate and interrogate discursive ideologies relating to hegemonic masculinities and to the normality of whiteness, specifically within one English classroom in an Australian private single sex boys' school in Perth, Western Australia.  A feminist poststructuralist theoretical framework is employed to explore how gendered and racialized positions available to adolescent males contribute to the shaping of their subjectivities, and how the social constructions of masculinities and femininities contribute to the ways in which adolescent males represent themselves. A quantitative approach, which included individual classroom observations, questionnaires and interviews, provided me with tools essential for examining the complexities of the effects of social constructs such as gender, sexuality and ethnicity on masculinist positionings at school.  The study reveals the complexities surrounding discourses of hegemonic heterosexual masculinities and privileges of whiteness on the situationally specific formation and negotiation of subjectivities in adolescent males' lives in one school. 
 
 Central findings of the study show that adolescent males in this single sex boys' school easily maintained socially constructed ideas surrounding the feminisation of females and masculinization of males, with notions of homophobia embedded in discourses of hegemonic masculinities. A resistance to alternative masculine discourses shows the impact and maintenance of hegemonic heterosexual masculinities for adolescent males.  However, through the use of particular texts, female teachers in the all boys' classroom were able to open up spaces for male students to interrogate hegemonic forms of masculinities, to interrogate power relationships, and to access alternative masculinities.  Ina similar vein, my findings show how easy it is for students to ignore social injustices in relation to racism and stereotyping of Indigenous Australians, and to retain notions that reinforce these injustices.  
 
 A major conclusion of the study is that social injustices are easily maintained through educational institutions as active agents of reinforcing ideas and ideologies, particularly when changes mean disruption of privileges, such as privileges associated with hegemonic masculinity or with whiteness.  Although this study was conducted within a middle class milieu, and thus the students were from an advantaged position in life, this does not justify their ignorance of issues of social justice.  Indeed, the findings highlight the importance of this kind of critical approach with middle class boys in single sex schools.  Important implications of this study are that findings contribute to the discovery of ways of changing deeply ingrained ideologies such as perceived gender dichotomies, the masculinization of males and the feminisation of females.  My findings also contribute to ways in which privileges, such as whiteness, can be deconstructed and interrogated by those in privileged positions.  My findings have potential significant implications for pedagogical practices.  Education provides a means by which tools can be utilized to deconstruct and interrogate notices which maintain privileges, and in the study particularly white male privileges.  Within the educational systems, an understanding relating to how subjectivities are shaped within a classroom setting will also lead to greater educational insights into how specific texts and classroom interactions affect students' self representation and understanding. Thus a gender equity and social justice curriculum committed to interrogating the ways in which male students subscribe, invest and negotiate hegemonic masculinities in advocated and has particular relevance to those males already in privileged class positions in terms of working towards a more socially just society.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/69/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the forests of south western Australia in relation to climate and landforms</field><field name="creator">Havel, Jaroslav J.</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to test the hypothesis that the vegetational patterns in the forested region of south western Australia are primarily determined by the interaction of climate and landform. 
 
 The region is an area of 4.25 million hectares subject to recent agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the state of Western Australia regarding long-term protection and management of forest (Regional Forest Agreement). The climate of the South Western forest region is warm temperate and summer dry, matching Koeppen's category Cs, usually described as mediterranean. The dominant geological features of South Western Australia are crystalline and sedimentary plateaus and coastal plains. They are subject to a complex process of weathering, denudation and re-deposition, which is the key determinant of landforms and soil patterns. Deep but infertile soils are prevalent. The dominant vegetation formation of the region is open forest, which reduces to woodland in the drier north and east and increases to tall open forest in the moister south. Floristically the vegetation is very rich, comprising over 3000 vascular plant species. The richness resides in the forest and woodland understorey and in the shrublands, heathlands and sedgelands of edaphically extreme sites. By comparison, the forest overstorey is very simple, only one or two species being often dominant over extensive areas.
 
 The validation of the hypothesis that climate and landforms determine the vegetation patterns in South Western Australia is carried out in the following stages:
 1) review of past studies of vegetation patterns in relation to the underlying environmental factors, relating them to one another in terms of floristics, 2) conversion of landform and climate maps for the region into vegetation maps by means of toposequences, that is gradients of topography, soils and vegetation within individual landform/climate combinations, 3) production of two sets of vegetation maps, namely six maps of vegetation complexes (1:250,000) and one map of vegetation systems (1:500,000), 4) testing the predictive capability of the resulting maps by comparing the occurrences of individual species of trees, shrubs and herbs predicted by map legends, with their records in FloraBase, the geographic information system of the Western Australian Herbarium, and 5) using the outcomes of the above studies to assess the validity of the hypothesis.
 
 Because the above hypothesis is so broad, it will be considered under seven headings:
 a) nature of the vegetation patterns (continuum or discrete categories),
 b) regional effect of climate and local effect of landform,
 c) effect of landforms on soil depth, texture and fertility,
 d) joint effect of slope, soil depth and texture on water balance,
 e) interactive effect of landform and climate on vegetation patterns,
 f) response of individual species to climate and landform, and
 g) effect of other factors of environment, such as fire, on vegetation patterns.
 
 The subsidiary hypotheses are defined in Chapter 5.
 
 It is concluded that the vegetation of the region forms a lumpy continuum from the wet south west to the dry north east. Within that broad continuum there are localised continua from waterlogged sites in depressions to drought-prone sites on steep stony slopes. However, the dominant vegetation of the region is open forest on plateau uplands with deep infertile soils. Although climate and landforms have a strong effect on vegetation patterns, they do not determine all vegetation patterns directly. Some tree species have  ranges of occurrence that are too broad for that, and others have ranges that are too restricted. A more probable explanation is that climate and landforms, together with fire, set the stage on which the interplay of species takes place and determines the structure and composition of the vegetation. An attempt is made to predict the likely effect of climatic changes on vegetation patterns. The applicability of the methodology developed to the mapping of other regions, especially the adjacent ones, is examined. A review is made of how the products of the study, in particular the maps, are currently being used, and suggestions are made how they could be used in the future.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/70/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the molecular function of the nuclear oncoprotein HOX11 in human t-cell leukaemia</field><field name="creator">Heidari, Mansour</field><field name="description">HOXll, the prototypical member of the HOXll family (HOX11, HOXllLl and HOXllL2) was originally discovered as a transcriptional regulator aberrantly expressed in tumours with an immature T-cell phenotype (T-ALL) as a result of specific chromosomal translocations involving T-cell receptor loci. Subsequently, it was revealed that HOXll is required for normal spleen development since newborn Hoxll-/- mice exhibit asplenia. In both its normal and abnormal roles, HOXll has been postulated to function by binding regulatory elements within specific target genes to control gene transcription. However, very few genomic targets of HOX11 have been identified and little is known about its mode of action. In this study, we sought to further understand the role of HOX11 in controlling differentiation and cell growth by 1) determining the identity of genomic sequences that are directly bound by HOXll and 2) determining the identity of proteins which exist within HOXll-containing nuclear complexes.
 
 To identify direct HOXll target sequences, a whole genome PCR-based screening method was employed using immobilised recombinant HOXll that had first been expressed as a biologically active GST fusion protein. Using this approach, restriction enzyme-cleaved human genomic DNA was selected for high-affinity HOXll binding sites. Unexpectedly, almost all clones isolated contained sequences derived from satellite 2 DNA that, together with related satellite 3 DNA, is found on most chromosomes at transcriptionally inactive pericentromeric heterochromatin. The specific binding of HOXl1 to satellite 2 DNA was verified by bandshift assays using both recombinant HOXll protein and nuclear extract derived from the T-ALL cell line, ALL-SIL. DNA-protein complexes containing HOX11 were identified by their ablation upon addition of HOXl1 antibody.
 
 To confirm that HOXll associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin in vivo, HOXll was characterised in terms of its nuclear localisation during interphase in unsynchronised leukaemic T-cells (ALL-SIL) harbouring a translocation involving the HOXll locus. Using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, HOXll antibody produced a punctate pattern of staining in the nucleus with discrete areas of dense staining superimposed on a diffuse distribution of HOXll protein. By dual staining, the bright HOXll foci correlated with centromeres since they overlapped with signals detected by an antibody specific for the centromeric protein CENP-B. Further evidence for a direct interaction of HOXll with satellite 2 DNA was provided by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In the presence of HOXll antibody, DNA fragments containing satellite 2 sequences were irnmunoprecipitated from sheared, cross-linked ALL-SIL chromatin but not from chromatin isolated from the HOXll-negative T-cell line PER-1 17. Finally, using a combination of immunoprecipitation with HOXll antibody, gel electrophoresis and mass peptide fingerprinting, a set of nuclear proteins were identified as potential HOXll interactors which are known to either localise to centromeric regions or act as regulators of gene expression. Together, these results implicate HOXl 1 in a functional interaction with centromeric heterochromatin, which may be a key feature of this oncoprotein in terms of both its T-cell transformation and transcriptional regulatory functions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/71/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organization development and the implementation of planned change</field><field name="creator">Henderson, John Charles</field><field name="description">This case study, conducted in a vocational and technical education institution at post secondary level, was concerned with the effects of an organization development intervention on the ability of an organization to implement a planned change initiated by itself.
 
 More specifically, the study hypothesized that organization development, or change to the organization itself, could enhance the process of planned change by the organization.
 
 The study develops at length the concept and theory of implementing planned change, of the critical importance of common understandings and shared expectations to this process, and of the centrality of resocialization and social interaction in successful implementation.
 
 The study also lists in detail the events and procedures used in this particular organization development intervention, as well as the concept and theory underlying organization development. A number of principles which guided the author's intervention activities are also listed and examined.
 
 Data on organizational change induced by the intervention were collected over a period of two years through a questionnaire, used for repeated measures, and through participant observation. These data are presented both quantitatively and qualitatively in the study. The qualitative data are presented in the form Eisner (1979) has described as educational criticism.
 
 Data on the implementation of planned change were collected through a questionnaire, used for repeated measures, a structured interview technique closely based on the Levels of Use methodology (Hall et al, 1975), and through participant observation data. Data were again collected over a period of two years and are presented both quantitatively and qualitatively.
 
 The study indicates clearly that the organizational intervention was successful in bringing about organizational change across a broad range of variables. These changes included organizational elements which research has identified as determinants of the implementation process, The study also indicates that during the period of the intervention the education institution concerned enhanced its ability to implement planned change, and that this enhanced ability was closely related to the organizational changes which had occurred as a result of the organization development intervention.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/73/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Giardia and Cryptosporidium in pinnipeds from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada</field><field name="creator">Appelbee, Amber</field><field name="description">Giardia and Cryptosporidium are protozoan parasites known to cause enteric disease in terrestrial mammals, reptiles and birds. Compared to the abundance of surveys that have examined Giardia and Cryptosporidium in terrestrial wildlife species, very few studies on either parasite have been undertaken on marine mammal species. Studies of shellfish, marine waters and water treatment plants clearly indicate that marine ecosystems are contaminated with Giardia and Cryptosporidium. In spite of these data the extent to which these parasites extend into the marine environment and how they may impact on marine mammal health remains largely unknown. The aim of this thesis was to expand our current knowledge of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the marine environment and in particular, the harp and hooded seal populations of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada.
 
 A large-scale serological survey of a large cohort of serum samples clearly show that, as is the case with terrestrial mammals, Giardia is ubiquitous in the marine environment. Sera positive for G. duodenalis-specific IgG were detected in almost all cetacean and pinniped species examined, and from all regions of the St. Lawrence estuary, Gulf of St. Lawrence and from the Canadian arctic.
 
 In the case of harp and hooded seals, they are actively infected with Assemblage A, a zoonotic strain of G. duodenalis and represent a previously unrecognised contributor to the overall environmental parasite burden. The discovery of this variant of Giardia in a phocid host, along with their susceptibility to infection with terrestrial strains of both Giardia and Cryptosporidium, highlight the potential zoonotic transmission from seals to humans through the consumption of uncooked intestines and general animal handling during research or hunting practices. The identification of this zoonotic strain of Giardia in seals also demonstrates the potential for anthropogenic activities such as human sewage treatment and agriculture runoff to be a significant source of contamination for marine mammals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/74/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of the form and level of organic versus inorganic copper and zinc in diets for growing and finishing pigs</field><field name="creator">Hernandez, Aracely</field><field name="description">Pharmacological levels of inorganic forms of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are frequently used in diets for pigs to improve performance and control post-weaning colibacillosis. However, the use of such forms and levels causes mineral accumulation in the soil, and is a non-sustainable practice from an environmental perspective. Alternatively, organic complexes of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) have been proposed to be more available to pigs, and when included at lower levels than inorganic sources of these minerals have significantly reduced mineral excretion in faeces without compromising performance. However the effect of these organic minerals fed simultaneously at low levels of inclusion has not been well studied. The general hypothesis tested in this thesis was that concentrations of Cu and Zn in faecal material would be reduced when fed in an organic (Bioplex) form without compromising performance or mineral homeostasis in growing/finishing pigs, in comparison to Cu and Zn fed in an inorganic (sulphate) form.   
 
 Two experiments were performed to test this hypothesis: Experiment 1 was designed as a 2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments, with two mineral forms (Bioplex and Sulphate) and two inclusion levels (High and Low). The 'low' levels aimed at providing 80 mg/kg of dietary Cu and Zn, and the 'high' levels aimed at providing 160 mg/kg of dietary Cu and Zn. Experiment 2 was designed as a 3x2 factorial arrangement of treatments, with two mineral forms (Bioplex and Sulphate) and three inclusion levels (Low, Medium and High). The 'low' levels aimed at providing 25 mg/kg of Cu and 40 mg/kg of Zn, the 'medium' levels aimed at providing 80 mg/kg of both Cu and Zn, and the 'high' levels aimed at providing 160 mg/kg of both Cu and Zn in the diet. Unfortunately the Medium sulphate grower diet was contaminated with excess Zn while manufacturing, which led to the exclusion of this treatment from the study.  
 
 In Experiment 1, pigs fed LB (Low Bioplex) or HS (High Sulphate) diets grew faster (P=0.014) and their carcasses were 3.5 kg heavier (P=0.020) than LS (Low Sulphate)- or HB (High Bioplex)-fed pigs. Pigs fed LB or HS diets had lower (P=0.001) levels of Zn in plasma, a higher (P=0.029) concentration of Zn in the pancreas and a lower (P=0.020) concentration of Zn in bone than pigs fed LS or HB diets. The concentration of Cu in liver increased (P=0.017) with the concentration in the diet as did Cu and Zn levels in faeces (P&lt;0.001) without any difference between mineral forms. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) tended to be improved (P=0.062) by the inclusion of Bioplex in the diet. The inclusion of Bioplex reduced (P=0.003) subcutaneous fat depth at the P2 site by 2.2 mm compared to the sulphate. In Experiment 2, there was no difference (P&gt;0.05) in growth rate between experimental diets, but again there was an overall improvement (P=0.012) in FCR when Bioplex were included. Blood and tissue Cu and Zn concentrations were within normal physiological ranges in all treatments, supporting a reduction of Cu and Zn levels in the diet. Only Zn level in plasma during the growing phase and Cu and Zn concentration in tissues increased (P&lt;0.001) with the addition in the diet. None of the biomarkers of Cu or Zn status analysed in the pigs showed any difference between the inorganic and the Bioplex forms. Copper and Zn concentrations in faecal material decreased (P&lt;0.001) with their inclusion in the diet, and only in the finishing collection there was a further decrease of 10% in Zn faecal concentration when Bioplex was included instead of the sulphate at similar low levels. Carcass and meat quality measures were independent of the Cu and Zn form or level, however a higher proportion of carcasses from LB-fed pigs had &lt;14 mm subcutaneous fat depth at the P2 site. The inclusion of Bioplex failed to have a significant effect on Cu excretion and its inclusion had an inconsistent effect on Zn excretion. 
 
 The overall findings from this thesis partially supported the hypothesis that the inclusion of Bioplex would reduce the concentration of Cu and Zn in faeces compared to the inclusion of inorganic forms at similar inclusion levels. Nevertheless, total Cu and Zn levels in growing/finishing pig diets could be reduced from 160 mg/kg of both Cu and Zn to 30 mg/kg Cu and 60 mg/kg Zn, in either the sulphate or the Bioplex form, without negatively affecting performance or mineral homeostasis in the pigs and significantly reducing Cu and Zn excretion (between 50 and 80%). The advantage of including Bioplex instead of sulphates was in the improvement in FCR. Carcass and meat quality were independent of the form and level of dietary Cu and Zn.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/75/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of two species of sparid on the west coast of Australia</field><field name="creator">Hesp, Sybrand Alexander</field><field name="description">Various aspects of the biology of the tarwhine Rhabdosargus sarba and western yellowfin bream Acanthopagrus latus were studied. The studies on R. sarba have focused on populations in temperate coastal marine waters at ca 32 degrees S and the lower reaches of an estuary (Swan River Estuary) located at the same latitude and in a subtropical embayment (Shark Bay) at ca 26 degrees S, while those on A. latus were conducted on the population in the latter embayment.
 
 A combination of a macroscopic and histological examination of the gonads demonstrated that R. sarba is typically a rudimentary hermaphrodite in Western Australian waters, i.e. the juveniles develop into either a male or female in which the ovarian and testicular zones of the gonads, respectively, are macroscopically undetectable. This contrasts with the situation in the waters off Hong Kong and South Africa, in which R. sarba is reported to be a protandrous hermaphrodite. However, it is possible that a few of the fish that are above the size at first maturity and possess, during the spawning period, ovotestes with relatively substantial amounts of both mature testicular and immature ovarian tissue, could function as males early in adult life and then change to females. Although R. sarba spawns at some time between late winter and late spring in Western Australia, spawning peaks later in the Swan River Estuary than in coastal, marine waters at the same latitude and Shark Bay, in which salinities are always close to or above that of full strength sea water, i.e. 35 0/00. While the males and females attain sexual maturity at very similar lengths in the Swan River Estuary and Shark Bay, i.e. L50s all between 170 and 177 mm, they typically reach maturity at an earlier age in the former environment, i.e. 2 vs 3 years old. Thus, length and consequently growth rate influence the timing of maturity rather than age. During the spawning period, only 9 % of the fish caught between 180 and 260 mm in nearshore, shallow marine waters had become mature, whereas 91 % of those in this length range over reefs were mature, indicating that R. sarba tends to move offshore only when it has become physiologically ready to mature. The L50s at first maturity indicate that the current minimum legal length in Western Australia (230 mm) is appropriate for managing this species.
 
 Oocyte diameter frequency distributions, stages in oocyte development, duration of oocyte hydration and time of formation of post-ovulatory follicles in mature ovaries of Rhabdosargus sarba in the lower Swan River Estuary (32 degrees 03'S, 115 degrees 44'E) were used, in conjunction with data on tidal cycles, to elucidate specific aspects of the reproductive biology of this sparid in an estuarine environment. The results demonstrated the following. (i) Rhabdosargus sarba has indeterminate fecundity sensu Hunter et al. (1985). (ii) Oocyte hydration commences at about dusk (18:30 h) and is completed by ca 01:30-04:30 h, at which time ovulation, as revealed by the presence of hydrated oocytes in the ovarian duct and appearance of newlyformed post-ovulatory follicles, commences. (iii) The prevalence of spawning was positively correlated with tidal strength and was greatest on days when the tide changed from flood to ebb at ca 06:00 h, i.e. approximately when spawning ceases. Spawning just prior to strong ebb tides would lead to the transport of eggs out of the estuary and thus into salinities that remain at ca 35 0/00. The likelihood of eggs being transported downstream is further enhanced by R. sarba spawning in deeper waters in the estuary, where the flow is greatest. (iv) Although mature ovaries were found in R. sarba in the estuary between early July and December, the prevalence of atretic oocytes was high until September, when salinities started rising markedly from their winter minima. Batch fecundities ranged from 2,416 for a 188 mm fish to 53,707 for a 266 mm fish. The average daily prevalence of spawning amongst mature females during the spawning period of R. sarba caught in the lower estuary, i.e. July to end of October, was 36.5 %. Thus, individual female R. sarba spawned, on average, at intervals of ca 2.7 days in each spawning season. Female R. sarba with total lengths of 200, 250 and 300 mm were estimated to have a batch fecundity of 7,400, 20,100 and 54,800 eggs, respectively and annual fecundities of 332,000, 903,000 and 2,461,000 eggs, respectively.
 
 Rhabdosargus sarba is shown to undergo size-related movements in each of the three very different environments in which it was studied. In temperate coastal waters, R. sarba settles in unvegetated nearshore areas and then moves progressively firstly to nearby seagrass beds and then to exposed unvegetated nearshore areas and finally to areas around reefs where spawning occurs. Although R. sarba spawns in the lower Swan River Estuary, relatively few of its early 0+ recruits remain in the estuary and substantial numbers of this species do not start reappearing in the estuary until they are ca 140 mm. In Shark Bay, R. sarba uses nearshore mangroves as a nursery area and later moves into areas around reefs. The maximum ages recorded for R. sarba in coastal marine waters (11 years) and Shark Bay (13 years) were far greater than in the lower Swan River Estuary (6 years). However, the maximum lengths recorded in these three environments were all ca 350 mm. Due to the production by size-related movements of differences amongst the lengths of R. sarba at given ages in different habitats in coastal marine waters, the composite suite of lengths at age was not fully representative of the population of this species as a whole in this environment. A von Bertalanffy growth curve, which was adjusted to take into account size related changes in habitat type, significantly improved the fit to the lengths at age of individuals in the composite samples for the population beyond that provided by the unadjusted von Bertalanffy growth curve. This resulted in the maximum difference between the estimates of length at age from the two growth curves, relative to the L derived from the unadjusted von Bertalanffy curve, reaching a value equivalent to 8 %. However, the maximum differences for the corresponding curves for populations in the lower Swan River Estuary and Shark Bay were far less, i.e. 1.7 and 3.2 %, respectively, and thus not considered biologically significant. Rhabdosargus sarba grew slightly faster in the lower Swan River Estuary than in either coastal marine waters or Shark Bay, possibly reflecting the greater productivity of estuarine environments.
 
 Acanthopagrus latus is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Detailed macroscopic and histological examination of the gonads of a wide size range of fish, together with a quantification of how the prevalences of the different categories of gonad change with size and age and during the year, were used to elucidate the sequence of changes that occur in the ovotestes of A. latus during life. The scheme proposed in the present study for the protandrous changes in A. latus differed from those proposed for this species elsewhere, but was similar to that of Pollock (1985) for the congeneric Acanthopagrus australis. The ovotestes of functional males develop from gonads which, as in older juveniles, contain substantial amounts of testicular and ovarian tissue. Such ovotestes, and particularly their testicular component, regress markedly after spawning and then, during the next spawning season, either again become ovotestes in which the testicular zone predominates and contains spermatids and spermatozoa (functional males), or become ovotestes in which the ovarian zone predominates and contains vitellogenic oocytes (functional females). Once a fish has become a functional female, it remains a female throughout the rest of its life. The trends exhibited during the year by reproductive variables demonstrate that A. latus in Shark Bay typically spawns on a very limited number of occasions during a short period in August and September and has determinate fecundity. The potential annual fecundities of 24 A. latus ranged from 764,000 in a 600 g fish to 7,910,000 in a 2,050 g fish and produced a mean [plus-minus]1SE of 1,935,000 [plus-minus] 281,000. The total length at which 50 % of A. latus become identifiable as males (245 mm) is very similar to the current minimum legal length (MLL) of 250 mm, which corresponds to an age of 2.5 years less than the age at which 50 % of males become females. Current spawning potential ratios calculated over a range of alternative values for natural mortality (M) for A. latus in Shark Bay suggests that the present fishing pressure is sustainable, but that the current MLL should be reviewed if recreational fishing pressure continues to increase.
 
 The age composition and von Bertalanffy growth parameters for Acanthopagrus latus have been determined. The relevant parameters were inserted into the empirical equations of Pauly (1980) and Ralston (1987) for estimating natural mortality (M). Total mortality (Z) was calculated using Hoenig's (1983) equations, relative abundance analysis and a simulation based on maximum age and sample size.The two point estimates for M for A. latus, which were both 0.70 year-1, greatly exceeded all estimates for Z (range 0.18 to 0.30 year-1), which is clearly an erroneous result. To resolve this problem of inconsistent estimates, a Bayesian approach was developed, which, through combining the likelihood distributions of the various mortality estimates, produced integrated estimates for M and Z that are more consistent and precise than those produced for these two variables using the above methods individually. This approach now yielded lower values for M than Z and a measure of fishing mortality that appears to be consistent with the current status of the fishery. This approach is equally applicable to other fish species.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/76/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-industrial personal benzene exposure in a mediterranean climate</field><field name="creator">Horton, Anthony</field><field name="description">Benzene is a volatile organic air pollutant that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is frequently reported in urban airsheds, principally as a result of evaporative emissions from motor vehicles. Increasingly stringent fuel quality standards have resulted in lower mean benzene concentrations in many urban airsheds, however the concentrations reported indoors can be higher than those in urban airsheds. Mean indoor benzene concentrations can reach one order of magnitude higher than those reported in urban airsheds. Long term exposure to very high benzene concentrations can result in leukemia, however the health risks of long term non-industrial exposure in the general public are currently uncertain.
 
 An important part of determining the risks of non-industrial benzene exposure is to first determine the influence of various activities on 24-hour personal benzene exposure. Previous research has identified commuting in a private motor vehicle and refuelling with low benzene fuel as statistically significant contributors to nonindustrial benzene exposure in the Northern Hemisphere, however none has quantified the increase in benzene exposure as a result of these activities over a 24-hour period in the Mediterranean climate. The results of the 1987 TEAM study in the South Bay section of California reported that automobile exhaust was a significant contributor to non-industrial benzene exposure based on exhaled breath concentrations (p&lt;0.05) and commuting in a private vehicle (p=0.0003) and refuelling (0.05) were important contributors based on personal benzene exposure concentrations (Wallace et al., 1988).
 
 The aims of this thesis were to identify the roles and importance of selected activities in personal exposure to benzene, to determine the increase in 24-hour personal benzene exposure attributable to these activities and quantify the risk posed by these activities in a Mediterranean climate. In particular, the aim of this thesis was to investigate whether commuting in a private motor vehicle and refuelling are significant contributors to non-industrial personal benzene exposure in a Mediterranean climate, or whether lifestyle and climate interact.
 
 This research was composed of a personal exposure study, a source monitoring study and a risk assessment. A cross-sectional personal exposure study was conducted for two reasons. Firstly, to quantify the mean personal benzene concentrations to which a representative sample of the general public of Perth was exposed as a result of their daily activities and behaviours. Secondly, to quantify the frequency of commuting by private motor vehicle and refuelling with low benzene fuel in Perth. Fifty participants were recruited for the personal exposure study, and asked to wear a monitor for 24-hour period (including weekends) in summer and winter and record their activities and locations in a diary. Prior to the monitoring they were asked to complete a questionnaire seeking background information on their home, lifestyle and behaviours. The results of the research revealed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the personal benzene exposure concentrations in summer and winter. An analysis of the questionnaire and time activity diary data using a generalised linear mixed model revealed that the time spent commuting in a private motor vehicle (beta= 0.281, p&lt;0.0001) and refuelling with low benzene fuel (beta = 0.194, p=0.033) were statistically significant contributors to non-industrial benzene exposure. Each hour spent commuting resulted in a mean increase in 24-hour personal exposure of 0.74 mcg-3 (beta= 0.729 mcg m-3, p&lt;0.0001). The mean increase in exposure per hour of commuting in a private motor vehicle was larger in winter (beta= 0.8 mcg m-3, p=0.008) than summer (beta= 0.67 mcg m-3, p=0.004). Refuelling increased personal exposure by 1.50 mcg m-3 (1.49, p&lt;0.0001) in each 24-period when refuelling was reported.
 
 Benzene source monitoring was conducted at selected locations in Perth for two reasons. Firstly, data quantifying non-industrial personal benzene exposure during refuelling and commuting in a private vehicle in Perth was needed, and secondly, to make an assessment of risk attributable to these activities.
 
 Benzene source measurements were conducted in two carparks in the Central Business District (CBD), in the vicinity of the northbound and southbound lanes of the Kwinana Freeway, and at a petrol station. The 7- day arithmetic mean benzene concentrations in the carparks were 4.49 mcg m-3 and 1.23 mcg m-3. The 7-day mean benzene concentrations northbound on the Kwinana Freeway was 2.78 mcg m-3, and the mean benzene concentration southbound was 2.57 mcg m-3. Benzene emissions in the carpark and on the Kwinana Freeway were measured during vehicle idling, which is representative of vehicle speed during heavy vehicle traffic. Benzene emissions at the petrol station were monitored in the vicinity of the petrol bowser, which is representative of emissions during refuelling. The 24-hour mean benzene concentration at the petrol station bowser was 38.15 mcg m-3.
 
 The results of this research revealed that refuelling and commuting in a private vehicle are the most significant contributors to non-industrial benzene exposure in Perth, and that the contribution of these two activities in Perth is far greater than in previous published research, on the basis of the results obtained from the generalised linear model. The results of this research quantified the increase in non-industrial benzene exposure from refuelling and commuting in a private motor vehicle in a Mediterranean climate for the first time, and quantified the lifetime excess cancer risk attributable to these activities in a Mediterranean climate for the first time. The lifetime excess cancer unit risks of these two activities in a Mediterranean climate were 7.4 x 10-5 or 7.4 per 100000 population for commuting and 15.03 x 10-4 or 15 per 10000 for refuelling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/77/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bio-sociological relationship between Western Australian Aboriginals and their dogs</field><field name="creator">Howe, Margaret L.</field><field name="description">The hypothesis central to this study is that distinctly Aboriginal patterns of relationship between humans and dogs are still evident in contemporary Aboriginal groups. The relationship's sociological characteristics in traditional and contemporary settings and its implications for canine and human health are also investigated.
 
 Field research employing survey, quantitative observation and specimen analysis techniques was conducted in 9 Western Australian Aboriginal groups of various backgrounds and settings. Results were compared to historic-traditional accounts and dog ownership studies in non-Aboriginal groups. 
 
 Traditionally dogs served Aboriginals most importantly for supernatural protection and to assist the collection of small game by women. In non-isolated groups, traditional utilitarian motives were superseded by the Western concept of dogs as companions. 
 
 Demographically, the Aboriginal dog populations surveyed were relatively large, and most dogs were classified as medium sized non-descript cross-breds. 
 
 Dogs were more commonly owned by adult and aged individuals, rather than by family units as is the Western cultural norm. Most dogs remained with their original owner and retained their original name for life.
 
 Traditional values of respect towards dogs were compromised to the discriminatory care of higher status animals only, effecting selection pressure against undesirable dogs, particularly females. Similarly, while many aged people were opposed to culling, most respondents regarded community pup production as excessive and accepted culling as necessary. Nevertheless prevention was the preferred option, with strong support for the previously unfamiliar concept of ovariohysterectomy. 
 
 Pups were raised in some respects like children in the traditional manner, indulgence giving way in adulthood to expectations of self-reliance rather than obedience. Most dogs were in good physical and psychological condition, though more likely to be afflicted by sarcoptic mange than other Australian dogs. Other parasites occurred at or below expected frequencies. 
 
 Close physical contact with dogs coupled with favourable microclimates allowed ample opportunity for transmission of canine zoonoses, but the actual risk to human health remains poorly documented.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/78/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic variation of two localised populations of Phytophthora cinnamomi from Western Australia and how they impact on Eucalyptus marginata resistance</field><field name="creator">H&#252;berli, Daniel</field><field name="description">Phytophthora cinnamomi is an introduced soilborne phytopathogen to Western Australia (WA) and impacts on 2000 of the approximately 9000 plant species indigenous in the southwest of WA. Amongst these is Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah), the dominant and economically important hardwood timber species of the jarrah forest. This thesis aimed to investigate the morphological, pathogenic and genotypic variation in two local WA populations of P. cinnamomi isolates. The populations were selected from areas where jarrah clonal lines selected for resistance to P. cinnamomi may be used in the rehabilitation of infested jarrah forest and rehabilitated bauxite minesites in the southwest of WA. Resistance against a range of isolates using different inoculation methods.
 
 Seventy-three isolates of P. cinnamomi were collected from diseased jarrah and Corymbia calophylla (marri) trees from two populations located 70 km apart and these were examined for phenotypic and genotypic variation. Microsatellite DNA analysis showed that all isolates were of the same clonal lineage. In P. cinnamomi for the first time I show that there is a broad and continuous variation in the morphology and pathology between two populations of one clonal lineage, and that all phenotypes varied independently from one another. No relationship was found between morphological and pathogenic characters. The ability of isolates in both populations to cause deaths ranged from killing all plants within 59 days to plants being symptomless 182 days after inoculation.
 
 Single and multiple paragynous antheridia formed along with amphigynous ones in mating studies with all WA isolates and a sample of worldwide isolates. Developmental studies and cytological examination showed fertilisation tubes developed asynchronously or synchronously from both antheridial types and indicated that either antheridial type contributed a nucleus for fertilisation of the oosphere. This is the first report of paragynous antheridial associations in P. cinnamomi. Antheridial variation is a characteristic that needs to be adjusted in the taxonomic Phytophthora identification keys.
 
 In underbark and zoospore stem inoculations of three 1.5-year-old jarrah clonal lines (two ranked as resistant (RR) and one as susceptible (SS) to P. cinnamomi in the original selection trials) at 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, it was found that the method of inoculation did not produce comparable results, particularly at 25 and 30 degrees C. At these temperatures, all three clonal lines had 100% mortality when inoculated underbark, but when inoculated with zoospores, one RR line had 60% survival and the SS and remaining RR line had 100% mortality. Generally, the level of resistance of all clonal lines declined with increasing temperature. Lesion development was measured at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C for 4 days in detached branches of an RR and SS clonal line inoculated underbark with four different P. cinnamomi isolates. Detached branches were found to be a potential screen for jarrah resistance to P. cinnamomi and to allow the identification of susceptible and resistant clonal lines at 30 degrees C.
 
 Lesion and colonisation development of P. cinnamomi isolates were assessed in situ (late autumn) of seed-grown and clonal lines of 3.5 to 4.5 year-old jarrah trees growing in a rehabilitated minesite jarrah forest in underbark inoculation of lateral branches (1995) or simultaneously in lateral branches and lateral roots (1996). Trees were underbark inoculated in lateral branches and lateral roots. Colonisation was more consistent as a measure of resistance than lesion length over the two trials because it accounted for the recovery of P. cinnamomi from macroscopically symptomless tissue beyond lesions, which on some occasions, was up to 6 cm. In the two trials, one RR clonal line consistently had small lesion and colonisation lengths in branches and roots. In contrast, the remaining two RR clonal lines had similar lesion and colonisation lengths to the SS clonal line and may, therefore, not be suitable for use in the rehabilitation of P. cinnamomi infested areas. The relative rankings of the jarrah clonal lines by colonisation lengths were similar between branch and root inoculations. Branch inoculations are a valid option for testing resistance and susceptibility of young jarrah trees to P. cinnamomi.
 
 The pathogen was recovered on Phytophthora selective agar 3-6 months after inoculation from 50% of samples with lesions and 30% of symptomless samples in a series of growth cabinet, glasshouse and field experiments. However, up to 11% of samples with and without lesions and from which P. cinnamomi was not initially isolated contained viable pathogen after leaching the plant material in water over 9 days. This indicates that the pathogen could be present as dormant structures, such as chlamydospores, where dormancy needs to be broken for germination to occur, or fungistatic compounds in the tissue need to be removed to allow the pathogen to grow, or both. These results have important implications for disease diagnosis and management, disease-free certification and quarantine clearance.
 
 No clonal line of jarrah was found to be 100% resistant using different inoculation methods, environmental conditions and when challenged by individuals from a large range of P. cinnamomi isolates. Even the most promising RR line had individual replicates that were unable to contain lesions or died with time. This suggests that further screening work may be required using more isolates varying in their capacity to cause disease and a broader range of environmental conditions. Jarrah clonal lines that survive such rigorous screening could then be expected to survive planting out in a range of environments in the jarrah forest and rehabilitated bauxite minesites.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/79/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual but not religious: a phenomenological study of spirituality in the everyday lives of younger women in contemporary Australia</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Kim Leanne</field><field name="description">In current discussions about contemporary forms of spirituality, consideration is given to the question, what is spirituality and to exploring the range of associated beliefs and practices. Common to most discussions is the acknowledgement that the term spirituality is ambiguous and does not represent any one finite quality or thing, but rather, is a wide and somewhat identifiable set of characteristics. Some commentators suggest that contemporary spirituality, characterised by its separation from institutional forms of religion, and represented by the hallmark expression I am spiritual, but not religious, is an increasing phenomenon in Australian society. In view of this, there are several debates about the merits of a spirituality without explicit links to religion (in particular Christian traditions) and whether a personal spirituality can hold any real depth or purpose, or whether it just perpetuates a superficial, narcissistic focus of the self. This kind of critique pays little attention as to how spirituality, and the associated beliefs and practices, are developed and applied in an everyday sense, and how this impacts on the lives of those who subscribe to their own sense of spirituality. 
 
 In this thesis, I shift the focus from analysing the merits of a personalised spirituality to exploring in depth some of the lay understandings and purposes underlying contemporary forms of spiritual practice. The primary concern of my thesis is to describe this phenomena of spiritual life as experienced by eleven younger Australian women aged 18-38 years inclusive, who considered themselves 'spiritual' women, yet do not necessarily identify with a particular religious denomination. At its core, and as a phenomenological study, the thesis undertakes a theoretical exploration of consciousness and the apprehension and formation of belief, meaning, and identity. Held central, and alongside the phenomenological methodology, is the feminist notion that every woman is the centre of her own experience, that any interpretations and understandings of women's spirituality, must start with the personal. The empirical stages of research therefore focus on an exploration of the women's personal understandings, experiences, interpretations and translations of spirituality to uncover the location and application of spirituality in everyday life. 
 
 A primary factor explored throughout the thesis is the intersection between emotional experiences, meaning and purpose, and notions of spirituality. It is my assertion that grief, crisis and trauma, and the more general emotional experiences arising from everyday life, can be a driving force to embark on an exploration of the spiritual; inform personal constructions of spirituality; and provide a basis for the articulation of that spirituality, with a central purpose of alleviating emotional pain. Thus, my main thesis contention is this 'new' form of spirituality, as experienced and practiced outside of religious institutions, was expressed by the women in this research as a conscious and pragmatic resource applied, and developed in relation to, the various events and experiences of everyday life, and in relation to the ongoing process of developing and locating a sense of self and identity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/80/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the western line: the impact of Central Queensland's heritage industry on regional identity</field><field name="creator">Huf, Elizabeth L.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which regional communities appropriate their historic icons of the past, integrating these 'markers of identity' into the wider socio-economic context.  It notes how nostalgia and the collective memory, together with a strong sense of place are reflected in celebrations which honour national and local historic characters and events, and observes the ways in which isolated rural towns reconcile their new tourist image with their pioneering past.   It will be argued that the concepts of nation and national identity are increasingly being challenged by the need for a social and cultural identity which belongs to the local community. A range of diverse cultures and heritage sites has been studied in order to analyse the dilemmas facing local, outback, and Indigenous communities in reconstructing a regional identity today. 
 
 The Heritage Trail can be seen as a symbolic rite of passage, and this thesis is indeed a personal journey divided into two major components. First, it takes the form of documentary, a visual component consisting of three video films which capture the heritage tourism product along the Tropic of Capricorn. On the Western Line documents the author's journey on 'The Spirit of the Outback' from the central coast to Winton and Kynuna, the home of Waltzing Matilda in far western Queensland. Two further historical productions The Legend of King O'Malley and The Triumph and Tragedy of Tommy Wills record local and national narratives, which both deliver a controversial picture of federation politics and pioneer settlement, colonial sport and frontier war, each focusing on a regional perspective within a wider national vision.
 
 The second, written component reflects upon the role of the documentary maker in recording a social history of these diverse communities. It examines the auteur/director's own perceptions of regional identity, and the oppositions and ambiguities of reality are juxtaposed with legend and myth.  This essay explores the different layers of meaning inscribed within central images of cultural tourism such as: the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach; the Australian Worker's Heritage Centre at Barcaldine; local museums at Mt. Morgan and Emu Park; the Dreamtime Cultural Centre; and the South Sea Islanders' Sugar Trail. Following Bennett and Bourdieu's work on museum visitors, the author's preliminary survey of tourists seeking Capricornia's increasingly popular heritage destinations is discussed.   In conclusion, it can be argued that the rapid growth of Central Queensland's cultural centres, local museums, and bicentennially funded outdoor art and 'unusual' monuments, has produced new sources of income in a community desperately seeking to survive.  The cultural tourist has become a major producer of the heritage industry which impacts strongly on regional identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/81/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining a common arbitrary unit in social measurement</field><field name="creator">Humphry, Stephen</field><field name="description">In educational assessment, it is common to equate test forms in order to draw comparisons between different populations of students. The process of test equating presents a number of challenges, many of which relate inherently to the problem of maintaining a common unit and origin.
 
 In order to develop a general theoretical approach to maintaining a common unit and origin in the measurement of quantitative attributes, the role of the unit is carefully examined. Classical physics is explicitly adopted as the guiding paradigm during the investigations throughout the dissertation. Accordingly, the central objective is to develop a theoretical foundation for maintaining a common unit and origin which meets two criteria: (i) it must be congruent with the definition of measurement in physics captured in the classical theory of measurement (Michell, 1999); and (ii) it must meet a key requirement of measurement in the physical sciences identified by Rasch (1960/1980). Rasch identified the relevant requirement, that of invariant comparison, based on analysis of Newton's second law and showed that the Principle of Invariant Comparison is formally embodied in his measuring function for dichotomous data (Rasch, 1960/1980). This model provides the basis for the development and exposition of general concepts and principles in the dissertation.
 
 In order to achieve the central objective, the unit is made formally explicit and specified in relation to the experimental frame of reference. Rasch (1977) defined a Specified Frame of Reference (SFR) in terms of a collection of objects, a collection of agents, and outcomes of the interaction between these. Drawing on a fundamental distinction introduced by Andrich (2003), the unit of a SFR is referred to as a natural unit and is distinguished from an arbitrary unit, the magnitude of which is theoretically independent of any particular SFR and instrument contained within. From this distinction, a definition of discrimination arises naturally; a definition that is also congruent with classical physics. The distinction and related definitions provide the basis for derivation of a general form of Rasch's measuring function for dichotomous data, referred to as the Extended Frame of Reference Model (EFRM). It is shown that the EFRM provides a rational basis for maintaining a common unit and origin in assessment contexts involving two or more Specified Frames of Reference.
 
 Simulation and empirical studies are employed to illustrate application of the EFRM. These studies also serve to illustrate that quantitative hypotheses entailed by the EFRM are open to empirical tests by providing a context for the use of graphical methods and statistical tests of fit. Empirical investigations are used to illustrate consequences of differences between natural units in the context of applied educational assessment. The studies also provide a context in which to characterise the model, and the structure of data that it entails. Although the simulation studies demonstrate the basic efficacy of the model, they also indicate scope for improvement in terms of the precision of estimates. To explore possible approaches to refining the estimation process, Maximum Likelihood (ML) equations are derived and examined. Firstly, Joint Maximum Likelihood (JML) equations are presented. Following this, Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) equations are derived. It is shown that while the CML equations permit separation of the person and item parameters, item locations are expressed in terms of natural, rather than arbitrary, units. A particular approach is proposed, emphasising links to the classical theory and the Principle of Invariant Comparison. In considering the proposed approach, a distinguishing feature of the definition of discrimination is highlighted: specifically, the nature of its definition represents the importance of relationships between quantitative attributes, and the specific structure of these relationships, to the measurement of any particular attribute. Although it is not possible to fully study this feature given the scope of the work, it is a key to the implications of the general theoretical framework embodied in the EFRM. Accordingly, these implications are touched on before concluding the dissertation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/82/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In search of an appropriate analogy for sports entitites incorporated under associations incorporation legislation in Australia and New Zealand using broadly conceived corporate law organic theory</field><field name="creator">Huntly, Colin Thomas</field><field name="description">Common lawyers are notoriously suspicious of legal theory. This is exemplified by the dearth of theoretical content in Australian corporate law debate. If the first sin of legal theory is to presume that it can offer a blueprint for actual decision-making and be a substitute for judicial and lawyerly wisdom, then surely it is an equal transgression to profess that judicial and lawyerly wisdom can for long elude criticism without a sound theoretical basis.
 
 Reasoning by analogy is commonplace. This is as true in legal reasoning as in any other discipline. Indeed, it has been suggested that in the Australian legal context analogical reasoning is the very same judicial and lawyerly wisdom referred to above. In order to determine whether there is a true analogy, a number of legal scholars have suggested that a variety of potential known source analogues should be carefully analysed for their potential relevance to a less familiar target analogue lest an inapt analogy should lead one into error.

This thesis contests this assertion by showing that women workers' ability to form enterprise unions in the Philippine garments industry are enhanced by transnational production arrangements involving an overseas market.  Specifically, the thesis demonstrates that, in order to meet the quality and delivery requirements of overseas buyers and contractors, local owners and/or production managers are forced to routinely keep more production in-house in order to exert more direct controls over the work processes of their women sewers.  By thereby limiting the amount of local subcontracting which is done, women workers are agglomerated in larger numbers in the one place and, consequently, their capacities to engage in collective action - as indicated by the establishment of enterprise unions - is markedly increased.
 
 Empirically, the argument of the thesis draws on a 'multiple-case' study of sixty-five garment-making establishments located in and around Manila.  The study involved interviews with owners, production managers and/or trade union officials about the local subcontracting practices of their establishments.  The conclusions drawn about the links between export production and enhanced labour organising capacities at the enterprise level are corroborated by the 'commodity chain' literature on industrial deepening in the international garments industry and the status of the Philippine industry in this regard.  But rather than think simply in terms of industrial deepening, this thesis is concerned with the impacts of exporting on class processes. 
 
 Theoretically, the thesis thus draws on the Marxist view that capitalist development entails changes in the social form of labour, through the real subsumption of labour.  But, whereas Marx linked the real subsumption of labour to greater capitalist controls over the labour process, in this thesis the real subsumption of labour is also tied to concomitant changes in the spatial form of the labour process. From this standpoint, the thesis engages with labour process theory after Braverman (accusing it of often failing to link capitalist control to class processes) and with theories of class (which often ignore the social and spatial form of the labour process). In tying organising capacities of women workers at the enterprise level to changes in social and spatial form of the labour process, it is nevertheless argued that these capacities are also shaped at the national level by the legal framework for legitimate organising and by 'political space' in which the law in fact operates.   In this regard, it is argued that, whilst the state often passes laws to protect labour standards, it does not grant workers the means to ensure such standards are actually enforced. 
 
 The thesis also challenges the view that the recruitment of women is a strategy which employers deliberately use in the Philippine garments industry to limit industrial conflict.  Against this assertion of a rational economic basis to women's employment, the thesis argues that women are employed for sewing jobs as a result of the sex-typing of such jobs; but that this is also more an effect than a cause as the feminisation of sewing in the modern garments industry is embedded in class processes in the nineteenth century in Europe and the United States.  Gender is a dimension of labour control, but women workers in the garments industry are not employed to limit enterprise unionism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/84/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating four and five-year old children's responses to interactive television programs</field><field name="creator">Hynd, Anna Ruth</field><field name="description">While it is commonly believed that 'interactive' media provides benefits to young children not obtained from 'non-interactive' media, there has been little research examining this issue, or the kinds of interactivity that elicit these benefits. The present study examined the attention, comprehension, and enjoyment of young children viewing different kinds of interactive television programs compared with those of children viewing the control prototype (non-interactive) programs. Three interactive prototypes and one control prototype of Dora the Explorer, Hi-5, and Play School were examined on these outcome measures. The interactive prototypes allowed participants to make simple choices about program content using a television remote control. Four hundred and ninety eight children aged four (49.4%) and five (50.6%) years individually viewed one of the prototypes, and the children's attention, comprehension, and enjoyment were examined. Participants were boys (49.7%) and girls (50.3%) drawn from Government (64.9%), Catholic (27.6%) and Independent (7.4%) schools in Perth, Western Australia.
 
 Significantly higher attention, comprehension, or both were found for children interacting with two of the prototypes allowing increased viewer participation compared to children viewing the control prototype prototypes. Interactive prototypes allowing participants to repeat sections of program content also elicited significantly higher comprehension than control prototypes. However, interactive prototypes allowing participants to customise aspects of the program did not result in differences in the outcome measures compared with control prototypes. It was also found that interactive prototypes offering participants narrative choices were associated with significantly lower attention, comprehension or enjoyment for either interacting or non-interacting participants compared to the control prototypes. It is argued that interactivity, per se, does not bestow any benefits, with only specific models of interactivity resulting in higher comprehension or attention. In fact, some applications allowing young children to make choices about program narrative appears to disrupt program comprehension. It is concluded that successful interactivity builds upon the features of well-designed traditional children's television; opportunities for increased participation, and the repetition of content.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/85/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fire and the persistence of tuart woodlands</field><field name="creator">Archibald, Robert Donald</field><field name="description">Tall tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) trees are a defining element of the landscape of Perth and the coastal plain to the north and south. However, with the health of some tuart stands deteriorating, most notably at Yalgorup south of Perth, concerns are heightening that the already fragmented tuart ecosystem will continue to contract, leaving a cultural and ecological scar in the landscape. Like many other eucalypt ecosystems, tuart woodlands have had a long association with fire and are believed to have been frequently burnt by the Aborigines prior to European settlement. Today, fragmentation and European land management practices have led to a lower frequency of fire across most remaining woodlands, but also episodes of intense fire at shorter intervals in some areas. Individual fire events as well as fire regimes have the potential to shape the structure, composition and extent of ecosystems, and eucalypt ecosystems are no different. Thus, the impact of fire and fire regimes on tuart health and regeneration was investigated in this study.
 
 A survey of the woodlands at Yalgorup revealed tuart decline was present across a range of sites with contrasting fire histories. Tuart health was poorest at the longest unburnt site (35 years) and the site burnt by frequent wildfire (three fires in 13 years), suggesting these extreme fire regimes had played a role in the decline. Nevertheless, low ratings of tree health at sites burnt approximately once per decade, point to factors other than fire playing a role in the decline of tuart at Yalgorup. The tuart populations at Yalgorup were dominated by individuals in larger size-classes and there was a significant negative relationship between tree size and the probability of tree mortality. In one stand in Yalgorup National Park, 38 % of the tuart saplings/trees had died. It follows that the regeneration and development of tuart seedlings into adults will need to occur within the next one to two decades if these woodlands are to persist. Seedling counts confirmed that tuart regeneration was virtually absent in unburnt areas, as is common with eucalypt species. Interpretations of size-class distributions suggested controlled burning contributed little to recruitment, whereas in areas subject to wildfire outside Yalgorup, tuart had regenerated in abundance such that size-class distributions were skewed towards the smaller size-classes. A repeat survey of plots established in 1976 supported anecdotal reports that the mid-storey tree peppermint (Agonis flexuosa) was increasing in density and height in Yalgorup. The skew towards the smallest size-class within peppermint populations at Yalgorup and the presence of seedlings ( &gt; 200 seedlings ha-1) within areas not recently burnt (at least four years since fire) brought into focus the differing mode of regeneration for this species in comparison to tuart. In further contrast to tuart, mature peppermints were in good health with no dead trees reported in the population surveys. A possible role for competition in tuart decline was highlighted by significant negative correlation between peppermint density and tuart health. Together, these results suggest that a general drift from tuart woodland to peppermint forest appears entrenched.
 
 Comparative studies of the bark thickness, fire response and resprouting behaviour of tuart and peppermint illustrated the capacity of individuals of both species to persist with recurrent fire. As adults or juveniles, tuart and peppermint resprouted following complete canopy scorch, and often from crown branches: an ability not uncommon for co-occurring tree species and shrubs in this environment. Survival was between 75 and 100 % for fully-scorched tuarts in size-classes ranging from small saplings to trees across six sites. From the small sample of peppermints available for comparison, seedlings and small saplings appeared to be more vulnerable to mortality by fire; only 45 % of individuals with a diameter at breast height less-equal 1 cm survived following complete canopy scorch from a controlled burn. With thicker bark, a reliance on stem epicormic buds rather than a lignotuber for resprouting and a greater capacity for height growth, the fire resistance and post-fire recovery of tuart would be expected to differ from that for peppermint. Opportunities for managers to exploit these differences in their burning prescriptions so as to address the drift from tuart to peppermint dominance were outlined. In addition, results indicating a positive response in canopy condition for tuarts with &lt; 10 % canopy scorch following a controlled burn imply that tuart vigour may benefit more immediately from fire. But, observations also revealed that spikes in intensity within controlled burns can damage large unhealthy trees and thereby accelerate the decline process. Thus, the application of fire to declining tuart stands needs to be conducted skillfully.
 
 Patterns of growth and survival for tuart and peppermint seedlings were linked to the contrasting ability of the species to establish at burnt and unburnt sites. The purported importance of ashbeds in tuart establishment was demonstrated; at the end of summer (February) at a recently burnt site (Golden Bay), the mean height of tuart seedlings on ashbeds was three times that for those off ashbeds, and the survival rate on and off the ashbeds was 35 % and 15 %, respectively. Therefore, while important, tuart seedlings were not dependent on ashbeds in this instance. The hardy nature of peppermint seedlings when compared to tuart was illustrated when the species were planted in an unburnt area of tuart-peppermint woodland at Yalgorup; nine months after planting, 38 % of the peppermint seedlings survived while only 9 % of the tuart survived. Most of the mortality was linked with the summer-drought period and it was suspected that peppermint seedlings were more drought tolerant. A complementary glasshouse experiment showed that tuart had a greater shoot:root ratio than peppermint, which may be one factor in the greater sensitivity of this species to drought. Further, this experiment revealed that with an increase in nutrient supply, the proportional increment in rooting depth for tuart (1.6 times) was significantly greater than for peppermint (0.3 times). An increased availability of nutrients in ashbeds following fire, particularly for phosphorous, was measured within tuart woodland. Therefore, it was inferred that the availability of nutrients was a critical factor increasing the growth, rooting depth and consequently the greater survival of tuarts on ashbeds. Overall, tuart was concluded to share the Competitor strategy (after Grime) in common with many other eucalypts: rapid growth and the attainment of a large size. On the other hand, peppermint exhibits some of the traits of the Stress Tolerator strategy (after Grime): low minimum resource requirements for growth and survival.
 
 The consequence of the increasing cover of peppermint on tuart establishment was explored in field experiments with planted tuart seedlings. No significant impact on seedling growth or survival was observed. There was a declining trend in the seedling growth rates under the high compared to the low peppermint density treatments as the second summer of the experiment was approached, although a statistical difference could not be shown. Peppermint density also had no significant influence on damage to the seedlings from insect attack or the foliar pathogen Mycosphaerella cryptica. Overall, insects and M. cryptica had only an incidental impact on the seedlings: the mean level of canopy damage per affected seedling was &lt; 10 % for either of these two damage agents. Soil type, specifically whether growth occurred on an ashbed was demonstrated to be the most important factor in tuart growth and survival in the 18 months following planting. Although survival was superior on ashbeds (88 %), mean survival was &gt; 50 % in unburnt soil 18 months after planting indicating the potential for restorative plantings to occur in some woodlands between fires.
 
 Tuart decline, and the role of altered fire regimes in the decline is complex and further avenues of research were emphasized. Nevertheless, the findings of this and other studies are sufficient to enable purposeful actions to conserve and restore tuart woodlands; recommendations regarding the application of fire with a view to these goals are presented in the final discussion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/86/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ICTs: empowering Western Australian women?</field><field name="creator">Green, Joanne Helen</field><field name="description">The idea that women are empowered through their learning and use of ICTs (ICTs are defined as computers, the Internet, and e-mail for the purposes of this thesis) has been adopted by international development agencies and the governments of most nations throughout the world. Hence, many agencies and governments have made courses on computers, the Internet, and e-mail available to women with the aim of empowering them.
 
 Empowerment is defined variously and has at its core the social, political, and economic development of women to create equality and challenge patriarchy. Women's empowerment seeks to bring about societal change that will create conditions and structures that foster and maintain gender equality in all facets of life.
 
 This thesis examines the notion of women's empowerment through ICTs. The first section of the thesis uses development and empowerment literature to define, explain, and critique women's empowerment and the conditions under which it is supposed to operate. The second section presents, analyses, and discusses the data collected from a questionnaire answered by some Western Australian women on their experiences of ICTs courses offered by the Western Australian government and their subsequent life changes. The questionnaire was designed to establish whether or not women are empowered to create societal change and challenge patriarchy, as suggested in literature.
 
 The results from the questionnaire show that the majority of the women in the cohort were empowered to the intrapersonal (or micro-) level only. Hence, there was little evidence for the majority of women of the interpersonal (or meso-) level and no evidence of the societal (macro-) level empowerment of the women through ICTs. Therefore, this study does not support the contention that women are empowered through ICTs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/87/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immigrating to and ageing in Australia: Chinese experiences</field><field name="creator">Guo, Xiumei</field><field name="description">Chinese communities, large or small, exist in almost every country in the world. The huge Chinese diaspora has played a big role in the global economy. Those in Australia are no exception. The first significant Chinese immigration to Australia came in the 1850s during the gold rush era. Since then Chinese immigration to Australia has gone through up and down periods. However, only after the diplomatic relationship between Australia and China was established in 1972, did mainland Chinese begin to come to Australia directly from China. Since 1978 when China opened its door to the world and started its economic reform, more and more Chinese students have come to Australia. In particular, after the Tiananmen Square Incident in 1989, a significant number of Chinese became Australian permanent residents and contributed to the fast growth of the established Chinese community in Australia.
 
 This thesis analyses immigration and ageing issues relating to the Australian Chinese community, which is now not only one of the oldest in Australia, but also one of the biggest, and economically, one of the most dynamic communities. It draws a historical and contemporary picture of overseas Chinese in Australia, including the Chinese migrants who remained in this country after the Tiananmen Square Incident. This study developed a model to investigate a wide range of factors that drive population movement between Australia and China. The determining factors include a wide range of push and pull forces that change constantly with the overall political, economic and environmental developments. The research findings claim that the pull, push and enabling factors interact with each other to influence Chinese people's decision to migrate from China to Australia. It becomes apparent that there are certain determinants which can help explain, understand and project this complex process in the future.
 
 This study further proves that Chinese migrants in Australia have made the smooth, but challenging transition between their native and adopted countries. Being involved into the Australian mainstream society, Chinese Australians have achieved economic adaptation and enjoy living in their new country. In addition, Chinese citizens who are studying as international students in Australia are potential skilled migrants and they are likely to apply for migration status after completing their studies. It is believed that Australia continues to be one of the most desired Western migration destinations for Chinese nationals and the magnitude of the Chinese ethnic community in Australia will continue to grow. In the future, the number of elderly Chinese in Australia is likely to increase as the majority of current economically active Chinese intend to retire in Australia and more older Chinese are expected to migrate to Australia for family reunion. As part of the general issues of Australian ageing population, this study attempts to raise the awareness of the challenging life-style of the Chinese elderly in Australia now and future.
 
 This study offers convincing evidence that Chinese immigrants play a vital bridging role in promoting business and trade between Australia and China. Due to China's economic growth, their movement between these two countries will be more frequent. Overall, this study provides important considerations for policy makers and will benefit the broad communities, migrants and policy planners in understanding the model of Chinese immigration into Australia. The insights gained from this study should have important policy implications for a more sustainable way of living not only in Australia, but also in China and other countries with Chinese immigrants.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/89/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living well towards others: the development of an everyday ethics through Emmanuel Levinas and Alfred Schutz</field><field name="creator">Haigh, Yvonne Therese</field><field name="description">This dissertation is concerned with what it means to live well towards others. It develops a form of everyday ethics that emphasises how existing in the world and being ethical are entwined. To develop this approach to ethics this study employs Alfred Schutz's phenomenological descriptions of everyday world and Emmanuel Levinas's concept of the ethical. The purpose of the thesis is to develop an understanding of ethics that operates at the everyday level of human-to-human contact. This form of ethics is significant in that it indicates that being ethical is an important aspect of human life. My intention is to show that ethics is always more than simply the institution of codes of conduct that govern the way people act. 
 
 The significance of the thesis is that it contributes both to ways in which ethics can be understood and to the manner in which ethics can be operationalised at an institutional level.
 
 My thesis has four specific aims. First, to examine the conditions and characteristics that constitute the everyday world as understood in Alfred Schutz's work. Second, to explore Emmanuel Levinas's understanding of the ethical. My third aim is to synthesise these theorists' ideas through my heuristic device, Echoes of the Other. This device will allow me to extract the conditions for and features of an everyday ethics. My fourth aim is to point to an in situ illustration of this approach to ethics. This will be drawn from my observations at the Western Australian Police Academy.
 
 My argument is that synthesising Levinas's and Schutz's ideas will enable the development of an everyday ethics. This will highlight the ways in which ethics functions at the micro levels of human life. This study contributes to approaches to ethics, and specifically, ethics derived from Levinas's ethical relation. This approach can be of use to people interested in ethics, phenomenology, the works of Levinas and Schutz and those concerned with developing ways to live well towards others.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/90/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Television and positive ageing in Australia</field><field name="creator">Hall, Jane</field><field name="description">As a means to engage with others, television offers the viewer a great deal. In Australia commercial TV is particularly popular, and many turn daily to this cultural arena which graphically portrays our shared concerns and values. Viewers are kept informed and entertained, advertisements display the luxuries and necessities that direct lifestyle choices,and local and global stories are presented for mutual consideration. Audiences are connected not only with products,personalities and newsmakers, but also with fellow viewers who are sharing the experience. Retired people take particular advantage of this multi-faceted link with the outside world, when additional leisure time and reduced social and physical mobility create spaces that can be filled with the narratives and 'para-social' connections of a medium that transports the world to the viewer. Yet one definitive statement that can be made about popular television is that older people are rarely acknowledged and often ridiculed. An easily accessible and valuable communications medium marginalises those most dependent upon it - for information and entertainment, but also, I would argue, dependent upon it to help facilitate key recommendations of the 'successful ageing' formula.
 
 Authoritative prescriptions for ageing well emphasise the benefits of social engagement, with television helping to facilitate this by involving the viewer with local concerns and wider accounts of human enterprise. Yet the popular media often presume that older people are no longer viable consumers or citizens, thus alienating them from mediated stories and populations. 'Success', according to commercial media sensibilities, is equated with youthfulness and economic means - twin attributes rarely associated with retired people. As a result, advertising is directed primarily at young, middle-class audiences, and the TV programmes to hook their attention are often typecast with similarly youthful protagonists. Older viewers are taken for granted and rarely acknowledged, and more disconcertingly, stereotyped and ridiculed to empower younger viewers. This dissertation seeks to explore these issues from a sociological perspective, primarily within the Australian context. Research strategies include a detailed analysis of the role of television in older people's lives and how they are portrayed, with results aligned with 'successful ageing' guidelines. Included in this approach is a study of how older people are portrayed on commercial TV in Australia, and a discussion of findings. The final section includes a chapter which consists of an examination of negative media portrayals from a political and human rights perspective, and the final chapter which asks how the oldest and frailest may by impacted by the cultural devaluation of old age.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/92/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, phylogeography and movement of Kirramyces spp. associated with leaf blight diseases of plantation eucalypts</field><field name="creator">Andjic, Vera</field><field name="description">When this study commenced in early 2004, only five Phaeophleospora species. had been reported from eucalypts of which only two; P. destructans (STE-U 1336) and P. epicoccoides (STE-U 1346) had been sequenced. In a former study, Phaeophleospora species emerged in two separate clades suggesting that Phaeophelospora is polyphyletic. The appearance and severity of lesions on eucalypt leaves are generally used to recognise the species of Phaeophleospora responsible for disease. However, depending on host and climate, the symptoms associated with infection by P. epicoccoides, P. eucalypti and P. destructans can be almost identical and incorrect diagnosis is a common problem. Thus, Phaeophleospora species were compared based on DNA sequences and multi gene genealogies were constructed. In addition species- specific primers were designed and tested on leaf material.
 
 Many isolates of Phaeophleospora spp. were collected and sequenced, and all Phaeophleospora spp. from eucalypts were shown to cluster together and are closely related to the most important leaf pathogens associated with eucalypts namely Colletogloeopsis zuluensis, Mycosphaerella cryptica and M. nubilosa. In contrast, these fungi are distantly related to the type specimen of the genus Phaeophleospora, P. eugeniae. Furthermore, all DNA sequences of isolates of P. destructans examined in this thesis, including the ex-type culture, were identical but different to one previously lodged in GenBank.
 
 This phylogenetic separation led to a morphological study of the species assigned to Phaeophleospora and compared the species from eucalypts with P. eugeniae the type specimen of Phaeophleospora. The phylogenetic and morphological studies show that P. eugeniae is well separated from Phaeophleospora spp. occurring on eucalypts and led to the resurrection of the previous generic name, Kirramyces for Phaeophleospora spp. occurring on eucalypts. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis and morphological observation of Kirramyces spp. and Colletogloeopsis spp. occurring on eucalypts showed considerable overlap between these two genera. Therefore, Colletogloeopsis was reduced to synonymy with Kirramyces. Consequently, the genus Kirramyces was expanded from five to 14 species, and included the description of two new species, K. angophorae and K. corymbiae. In order to assist with their identification a key based on morphology of conidia for Kirramyces species was developed.
 
 Kirramyces destructans is a devastating pathogen originally described from Indonesia in 1996 and has since been found throughout Asia where all common tropical and subtropical plantation eucalypt species and hybrids are susceptible. K. destructans is considered a major biosecurity threat in Australia, both to native eucalypt forests and the tropical plantation industry. Prior to the current study, there had been no investigation into the origin and movement of this important pathogen. Thus, five gene regions and six microsatellite loci were sequenced for 43 representative isolates of K. destructans from a range of geographical locations and hosts. Two microsatellite markers detected very low nucleotide polymorphism (three haplotypes for each loci); five other gene regions, including four microsatellite region were uniform. This low level of genetic diversity provides strong evidence that K. destructans was introduced into Indonesia as a founder population and that it has subsequently been spread throughout Asia via human-mediated movement of germplasm. Timor and Northern Australia were considered to be a possible source of origin of this fungus, but the high susceptibility of native E. urophylla to K. destructans in Timor indicates that the pathogen is unlikely to be endemic to Timor.
 
 The current distribution of Kirramyces eucalypti is New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and New Zealand (North Island). The main host of this pathogen is E. nitens which is native to Victoria and New South Wales. Kirramyces eucalypti has not been found in South Africa, yet it causes a severe disease on eucalypt hybrids originating from South Africa growing in New South Wales indicating movement to these hybrids from either native eucalypts or nearby plantations. As such, K. eucalypti poses a threat for the plantation industry in sub-tropical and tropical Australia. The phylogeography of K. eucalypti in Australia and New Zealand was studied by sequencing three gene regions and one microsatellite locus of fifty-seven representative isolates of K. eucalypti from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and New Zealand. The highest genetic variation was found among isolates from NSW suggesting that K. eucalypti originates from NSW. Isolates in New Zealand appear to have been introduced from NSW. Isolates from Queensland were consistently different to those from other regions and may in fact represent a cryptic species or a hybrid.
 
 During monitoring of eucalypt taxa trials in far North Queensland, infected leaves resembling symptoms typical of K. destructans were collected and examined. Phylogenetic data based on three gene regions and some morphological characteristics revealed a new taxon described in this study as K. viscidus. Kirramyces viscidus was also shown to be closely related to the devastating pathogen K. destructans. Kirramyces viscidus had been found to cause extensive damage to eucalypt hybrids originating from South America, and less damage to E. grandis from Australia, indicating that this pathogen is probably endemic to Australia. Kirramyces viscidus has the potential to seriously damage tropical eucalypt plantations, especially if clonal and planted off-site.
 
 In conclusion, this study resurrected genus Kirramyces for the Phaeophleospora and Coletoglloeopsis spp. occurring on eucalypts. It also studied the phylogeography and gene flow of the two most important Kirramyces species, K. destructans and K. eucalypti and describes three new Kirramcyes spp. found on eucalypts in Australia. Very recently, K. destructans has been discovered in Northern Australia. This raises a whole series of new issues as there are now several pathogens, K. eucalypti, K. viscidus and K. destructans present in Australia that known to cause serious damage on plantation eucalypts. Recent investigations have also revealed several undescribed Kirramyces spp. in Northern Australia. Their impact, distribution, movement and potential for hybridization now need to be examined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/93/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the critical capacities of democracy through the work of Hannah Arendt and Jurgen Habermas: the occlusion of public space and the rise of homo spectaculorum</field><field name="creator">Harper, Tauel</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the condition of critical debate in contemporary liberal democracies that is based upon a combined reading of the works of Hannah Arendt and Jurgen Habermas. It begins with an elaboration of the position that Arendt and Habermas identify a similar malaise as afflicting modern liberal democracies, which is argued to result from a shared perception that such democracies fail to create a forum for critical public engagement. The argument that their democratic theories are highly complementary is further developed through an examination of their solutions to this critical failure, for these solutions reflect a sharing of important premises concerning the nature of power and freedom on the parts of Habermas and Arendt. A complementary reading of Arendt and Habermas also allows for a synthesis of their theories that results in a highly coherent picture of the form and processes of an ideal democratic forum. This synthesis of Habermas and Arendt, however, also suggests (or, at least, allows for the theorising of) the emergence of a new genus of political actor who is unlikely to engage in such a forum - a genus hereafter referred to as homo spectaculorum.
 
 This thesis, therefore, makes three related claims. The first, and most important, is that it is possible to read Arendt and Habermas together as highly compatible democratic theorists and that their analysis of contemporary political conditions presents a single position from which to view the critical failings of liberal democracies. The second claim is that synthesising Arendt's and Habermas's democratic theories enables the theorising of an ideal public space, along with the emergence of homo spectaculorum. The third, and final, claim made in this thesis is that the same conditions that lead to the emergence of homo spectaculorum can be understood to undermine the emancipatory potential otherwise proffered through critical public spaces.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/95/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expedition aux terres Australes: a web-based online role-play simulation : the enhancement of language acquisition through social interaction</field><field name="creator">Hartley, Andree Vanda Barbara</field><field name="description">This research project investigates to what extent a social constructivist approach to teaching and learning online can enhance the use of language acquisition for learners of foreign languages. I designed an online role-play simulation in which the students sailed on the expedition of Nicolas Baudin to Australia and took different authentic roles on a simulated voyage. All communication was conducted in the French language, thus enabling the students to interact in realistic conversations, relevant to this historic event. Being in a third year TAFE French class, the students had already been exposed to sound grounding in grammar, relevant vocabulary, and use of colloquial and idiomatic expressions, and thus they had acquired a reasonably high level of proficiency in the language.
 
 The study was conducted over a four-week period in which I examined the intense interaction between the participants, while fulfilling the role of facilitator/moderator. In this role, I gave clear guidelines as to what was expected from the participants; provided the students with their identity which was unknown to the other participants during the simulation; created incidents through a weekly 'Course of Events' announcement; answered all questions within 12 - 24 hours; encouraged engagement within the learning community; made occasional suggestions if the characters seemed uncertain of what to do next; and, above all, endeavoured to create a non-threatening, friendly online environment for the students.
 
 After the four-week online role-play simulation, the participants met for a debriefing session in which they revealed their identities and discussed any issues, in particular technical issues, that had emerged. This provided an opportunity for the participants to disengage from the virtual world in which they have been immersed for four weeks as well as an opportunity to reflect upon their personal learning. A qualitative methodology, drawing on interpretive research, was employed to analyse the data. Student pre- and post-questionnaires, online contributions by the students and the debriefing discussion were used as the major sources of data collection.
 
 Most of the students took up the challenge of interacting online through asynchronous and synchronous communication. The study focused on how the use of a social constructivist epistemology could enhance language acquisition for learners of foreign languages and also analysed to what extent did the students' participation in a webbased online role-play simulation affect their communication skills and fluency in the second language.
 
 The findings provided me with guidance for future implementation of online role-play simulations in which I would ensure that all students have the basic computer skills and necessary access to internet in order to participate fully in the simulation. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated many benefits to the language enhancement of the participants and will become a regular activity as it permits students to use their conversational skills in a 'real-life' virtual learning community.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/96/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the outer--not on the outer: women and Australian rules football</field><field name="creator">Hindley, Deborah</field><field name="description">This thesis identifies, examines and probes the nature of women's involvement in Australian Rules Football. Rather than have a single theoretical underpinning, an interdisciplinary approach, albeit with a feminist perspective, was applied because of the broad scope of the study. Australian Rules Football is an institution that can transcend class, race, and gender. It is also a multi-billion dollar industry. The game traces its origins back to 1858 and claims influences from rugby and an Aboriginal game called marn-grook. While it is played mainly by men, exclusively at league level, interest and involvement is not limited by gender. 
 
 Academics and administrators have frequently written off women?s involvement with football. Even though scholarly interest in both sport and feminism has grown since the 1970s, little significant work has been undertaken to examine women's interaction with Australian Rules Football. Leading Australian feminist Anne Summers rejected the notion that women could find anything of value in football apart from following players as devoted wives, mothers, girlfriends or 'groupies'. Through investigation of monographs and edited collections, I reveal that myriad scholars, feminists and historians have missed the point of sporting scholarship: many women enjoy involvement with football, they understand the game and its strategies and value being part of the football community in diverse and evolving capacities. 
 
 The original contribution to knowledge in this doctorate is to demonstrate that while women have had a central role in the development and maintenance of Australian Rules Football since the game was founded in colonial times, their contribution has gone unacknowledged by historians and administrators. My thesis places on record those omissions. Particularly, I highlight the lack of acknowledgement and respect for the work of a woman who authored a comprehensive and seminal social history written on the game. This is the archetypal example of how women, in many roles - both professional and personal - have been marginalized, despite playing pivotal roles with Australian Rules Football. The original contribution contained in these pages tracks Australian gender relations through the social institution of Australian Rules Football. To create both space and strategies for the revaluation of women in football history, a new model of female fandom is offered. The testimony of the women included is weighty in numbers and pithy in content. The scale of interviews represents diversity in age, class, ethnicity, regionality and role or function with football. Superficially it may appear that women can be placed in taxonomy. Women's involvement with Australian Rules Football is complex and their involvement enmeshes in the many facets and spheres of the game.
 
 The completion of this thesis follows the long overdue appointment of the A.F.L.'s first female commissioner, Samantha Mostyn, in June 2005. Without disrespecting Mostyn, this was a tokenistic cultural shift by adding a commissioner to the existing eight males with the goal of adding further business expertise, not a new insight or strategic cultural intervention. It also comes at a time when the Australian Football League's has a new challenge to address, with the growing interest and participation in Association Football in Australia after the qualification for the 2006 World Cup. At this moment of change and contestation, Women's Australian Rules competitions are impoverished through lack of structural and financial support while women's Association Football, both in Australia and internationally, is flourishing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/97/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An electrochemical study of reactions of nickel matte in acid media</field><field name="creator">Ho, Elizabeth M.</field><field name="description">Nickel matte is a nickel sulfide concentrate produced by smelting. It consists mainly of two components: a nickel-copper alloy and heazlewoodite (Ni3S2); but also contains varying amounts of djurleite, Cu1.96S. There are several hydrometallurgical routes for processing nickel matte. The most recent of these involves an oxidative leach in acid chloride or sulfate solution. Nickel is subsequently recovered fiom the leach solution by electrowinning or by hydrogen reduction. In the work described in this thesis, various aspects of the acid leaching of nickel matte are investigated using mostly electrochemical methods.
 
 The first section concerns the use of copper(II) as an oxidant for the alloy component of nickel matte. In this cementation reaction, nickel goes into solution while copper is deposited on the dissolving metal swf8ce. The same reaction is important in removing traces of copper present in the nickel solution. Here nickel powder is added to the process liquor. A survey of the literature pertaining to the cementation of copper by nickel shows that there is considerable dispute as to the conditions under which cementation takes place. Evans' diagrams for the cementation reaction were constructed by superimposing the polarisation curves for the oxidation of nickel and the reduction of copper. It was found that cementation occurred provided that the two polarisation curves intersected in the region of active nickel dissolution. Outside this region, a copper deposit could not be seen.
 
 The second part of the thesis presents some investigations into the electrochemistry of nickel sulfides and nickel matte, and compares both chloride and sulfate media. Oxidation and dissolution rates of nickel matte powders using copper(I1) as an oxidant were also carried out. Dissolution was chemically controlled and so the rate was very dependent upon temperature and solution potential. Displacement of copper(II) from solution to form copper sulfide was also found to be important.
 
 In addition to the above studies, which relate directly to the oxidative leaching of nickel matte, an investigation of the oxidation of HzS to sulfur in acidic solution was carried out. Sulfer deposition was found to be strongly dependent on substrate and pH. Under some conditions, two types of sulfur were deposited, with the more crystalline sulfer being reduced at the more negative potential.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/98/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mtDNA study of aspects of the recent evolutionary history and phylogeographic structure of selected teleosts in coastal environments of south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Hoddell, Richard James</field><field name="description">At present, there is a general lack of information regarding the spatial genetic architecture and genetic diversity of estuarine and coastal freshwater fish in Australia or about the interacting intrinsic, extrinsic and historical influences responsible for sculpting these patterns. This thesis represented the first investigation of the phylogeographic structure and recent evolutionary histories of teleost fishes from the coastal and estuarine environments of south-western Australia, using the resolution afforded by mtDNA sequence data. Available evidence indicated that, to different degrees, these species have limited potential for dispersal amongst local assemblages from different water bodies. As this theoretically reduces the confounding effects of recent gene flow on extant genetic structure, these fishes were well suited to studying the influences of historical factors. Historical influences were expected to be particularly profound, given that these coastal environments underwent massive modifications during Late Quaternary eustatic fluctuations.
 
 The thesis consists of four major components, which explored different aspects of interspecific and intraspecific phylogeny and p hylogeograp hy of three teleost species, based on mtDNA control region and cytochrome b fragments. First, the relationship between the endemic, 'strictly estuarine' Leptatherina wallacei (Atherinidae) and the more widespread, 'estuarine and marine' 6. presbyteroides was examined, with a view to establishing whether 6. wallacei represents a monophyletic or polyphyletic lineage and whether this species was derived recently (i.e. in Holocene estuaries). Second, the phylogeographic structure and genetic diversity of L. wallacei were investigated and compared with data from L. presbyteroides, with a view to using this information to interpret the recent evolutionary histories of each congener. Third, the divergence between assemblages of L. wallacei inhabiting two isolated coastal lakes was used to estimate a maximal substitution rate for the control region, which was then used to infer general time frames for the divergence between the two Leptatherina species and between the major phylogeographic partitions within each species. Fourth, investigations were initiated into phylogeographic patterns and levels of genetic diversity within and among assemblages of Pseudogobius olorum (Gobiidae) from several coastal lakes and an estuary. 
 
 Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the two Leptatherina species were characterised by exclusive and reciprocally-monophyletic lineages of aplotypes from both mtDNA regions, supporting the monophyletic origins of L. wallacei. Both 6. wallacei and 6. presbyteroides exhibited high levels of genetic diversity and extensive overall subdivision (e.g. Qsr = 0.691 and 0.644 respectively for control region data). There was a profound phylogeographic break in both species between all conspecific assemblages from the lower west coast (LWC phylogroup) and all those from the south coast (SC phylogroup), which suggested the influences of shared extrinsic and/or historical factors. There was limited genetic structuring within the two major phylogroups of either Leptatherina species, apparently reflecting recent connectivity amongst local assemblages, with subsequent fragmentation and insufficient time for lineage sorting. However, two major phylogeographic breaks distinguished monophyletic control region phylogroups of L. wallacei from the isolated coastal Lake Clifton and Lake Walyungup, consistent with their independent evolution following lacustrine entrapment during the Holocene.
 
 The divergence between these two isolated lacustrine assemblages of Leptatherina wallaceiformed the basis for an estimate of the maximal substitution rate of the control region. While these data were unable to provide a precise estimate of the actual rate of molecular evolution, all the evidence suggested that it was proceeding very rapidly. The maximal rate estimate of 172.3% lineage-' MY-' was among the fastest ever reported. Based on this rate, the two Leptatherina species diverged at least 1 SKya, thus rejecting a Holocene origin for L. wallacei. The divergence between the LWC and SC phylogroups of L. wallacei has been ongoing for at least GKya, while the equivalent divergence in L. presbyteroides has been ongoing for at least 11 Kya. As the time frames of these divergences were consistent with periods of massive environmental modifications associated with the end-Pleistocene fall in sea level and the HMT, it was likely that these factors have played important roles in sculpting the species' divergence and intra-specific genetic structure. Although useful in temporally scaling genetic divergences within and between the two Leptatherina species, wider application of this rate estimate to questions regarding other taxa was limited. For example, evident rate heterogeneity between the genera precluded its use with even the relatively closely-related atherinid Atherinosoma elongafa.
 
 Phylogeographic analyses identified high levels of genetic diversity and extensive genetic subdivision (e.g. st = 0.652 for control region) amongst an estuarine and several lacustrine assemblages of Pseudogobius olorum, although phylogeographic structure was shallower than in either Leptatherina species. There was increased divergence between three assemblages from the lower west coast and two from the south coast, consistent with the profound break evident in the Leptatherina. One lacustrine assemblage appeared to represent a distinct lineage and a preliminary maximal rate estimate (~61.4% lineage-1 MY-1) was calculated based on the minimum divergence of this assemblage from its nearest conspecifics. Although slower than the rate calculated for L. wallacei, this was still high for teleost fishes.
 
 Overall, this study indicated that historical environmental factors, especially those related to Quaternary eustatic changes, have played important roles in sculpting the phylogeography and evolution of three teleost species from south-western Australia. Moreover, as these species have differential dependencies on estuarine environments (is. 'strictly estuarine' vs 'estuarine and marine') and represented two different taxonomic groups (i.e. Atherinoidei and Gobioidei), historical environmental factors may have exerted similar influences on other coastal species in the region.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/99/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boys in and out of school: narratives of early school leaving</field><field name="creator">Hodgson, David Rodney</field><field name="description">Research and public attention into boys's education has increased in recent times among an emerging concern about the performance and retention of boys in schools. This concern, in many ways, constitutes a 'moral panic' (Foster, Kimmel and Skelton, 2001, p.1) sometimes producing generalised and alarming statements such as 'all boys are underachieving in school' and are therefore becoming the new disadvantaged (Foster, et, al., 2001, p.7). Alongside these populist concerns about boys in schools generally, is an emerging body of contemporary academic studies into early school leaving, (Trent and Slade, 2001; Smyth, Hattam, Cannon, Edwards, Wilson and Wurst,2000; Smyth and Hattam, 2004) boys' experiences of schooling, (Martino and Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2003), as well as some broader statistical evidence indicating a general decline in school retention rates in Australia since the early 1990s (Lamb, 1998). Performance in schools generally, and declining retention rates specifically, has been described as an unacknowledged national crisis (Smyth and Hattam, 2002, p.375).
 
 This study investigates boys' education generally and early school leaving specifically, by focusing on boys who leave school before completing year 10. The study explores the stories, meanings and constructed experiences of a small sample (5) of young boys aged 14 - 16 years, who have left secondary school just prior to being interviewed. This is a qualitative critical ethnographic (L. Harvey, 1990) study located within a constructivist epistemology (Crotty, 1998). It aims to investigate early school leaving through narrative (Cortazzi, 1993; Way, 1997) and ethnographic inspired analysis (Robson, 2002) of transcribed interview data. Such analyses are referenced against a macro socio-political, economic, and cultural context characterised by changing global socio-economic and political circumstances, especially in regard to how these impact on schools and future possibilities for young people (Spierings, 2002). It seeks further understanding by drawing from a framework of concepts that invoke discussion of school culture, identity practices and how these are inferred (Smyth and Hattam, 2004),produced,understood and enacted within schools and social contexts.
 
 This study reveals that schools (as cultural and institutional practices) co-construct the often painful, lengthy and contradictory processes and experiences of early school leaving. Early school leaving therefore needs to be seen as an institutional and not merely personal or individual phenomenon. Appreciating the way schools assist in the process of early school leaving is important to understand, as it is within this domain that alternative educational practices can be located, constructed and enacted. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the current public policy debates on boys in schools, and as such be seen as an important contribution to public discourses and policy processes that help shape responses to boys in schools in general, and early school leaving in particular.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/100/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of bauxite refining residue to reduce the mobility of heavy metals in municipal waste compost</field><field name="creator">Hofstede, Henricus T.</field><field name="description">Use of bauxite refining residue to reduce the mobility of heavy metals in municipal waste compost.
 
 Due to the adverse environmental impact of landfills and the lack of space for nearby population centres an unprecedented interest has developed in waste recycling with the objective to reduce the volume of waste disposed. Generally organic matter represents the largest fraction in the domestic waste stream including food, garden and paper waste.
 
 In the past efforts have been made to process this organic fraction into muniapal compost.However contamination of the compost with heavy metals has in many cases resulted in the lack of suitable markets and subsequent closure of compost facilities. A study was undertaken and aimed at reducing the concentration and mobility of heavy metals in municipal compost.
 
 Bauxite refining residue ha; a high capacity to immobilise metals in soils through precipitation, cation exchange and chemisorption (Fe- and Al- oxides).
 
 The first step in the study was to assess the metal adsorption capacity of red mud by equilibrating red mud with metal solutions. Metal removal from solution proved very high.
 
 Subsequently, the effect of red mud addition to municipal compost was studied in relation to metal mobility. In particular the interaction of metals with the mobile soluble organic fraction, the humic and fulvic acids, was investigated. It was found that most metals remained in the insoluble humin fraction and the metals in solution remained complexed to the soluble organic fraction. Red mud appeared to be able to adsorp fulvic and humic acids and thus indirectly immobilise the metals in solution. Red mud did not appear to be able to transfer metals from the organic fraction to the mineral red mud fraction.
 
 ft was kypothesised that, in order for the metals to be adsorped to red mud, the red mud needed to be present in the organic waste prior to composting. Metal adsorption to red mud is a rapid chemical reaction while metal complexation to the organic fraction takes a number of weeks, since it must be sufficiently oxidised to contain functional groups.
 
 In order to verify this hypothesis, an installation with seven incubators was developed which allowed composting to be undertaken under computer controlled conditions and monitored for temperature, airflow and carbon dioxide respiration. The incubators were filled with 10 kg of a mixture of grass clippings and sawdust. The first incubator functioned as a control. The contents of the rest of the incubators were spiked with the following metals: Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. In addition the contents of the 3rd - 7th incubators were amended with an increasing percentage of red mud, respectively 10,20,25,30 and 40 % by weight. After the mixture was composted, the metal mobility was reduced by approx. 80 - 99 %, depending on the metal. The mobility was assessed as leachable and plant available in relation to the total metal content. Red mud did not affect the composting process if &lt; 40% red mud was added.
 
 The next step was to compost municipal organic waste in a pilot plant (capacity 5 m3) using batches with and without red mud. Mixed waste was collected from 150 households and the glass, metal and plastic fractions were removed bx- manual sorting. The rest was composted.
 
 The red mud - compost had a relatively lower metal content and a reduced metal mobility compared to compost without red mud. The red mud - compost also had a 300 times higher pH buffer capacity and 90%less soluble organic matter.
 
 The addition of red mud prior to composting was found to reduce the concentration and mobility of metals in compost, improve the quality of compost as a soil conditioner, increased the resistance of the organic fraction against further breakdown and this process thus adds value to both red mud and organic waste.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/101/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mycorrhizal specificity in endemic Western Australian terrestrial orchids (tribe Diurideae): implications for conservation</field><field name="creator">Hollick, Penelope Sarah</field><field name="description">The specificity of fungal isolates from endemic Western Australian orchid species and hybrids in the tribe Diurideae was investigated using symbiotic seed germination and analysis of the fungal DNA by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP).  The distribution of the fungal isolates in the field was also assessed using two different seed baiting techniques.  The information from these investigations is essential for developing protocols for reintroduction and translocation of orchid species.  
 
 Two groups of orchids in the tribe Diurideae were studied.  Firstly, a number of Caladenia species, their natural hybrids and close relatives from the southwest of Western Australia were selected because orchid species from the genus Caladenia are considered to have among the most specific mycorrhizal relationships known in the orchid family ? an ideal situation for the investigation of mycorrhizal specificity.  Secondly, species of Drakaea and close relatives, from the southwest of Western Australia and elsewhere in Australia, which are never common in nature and occur in highly specialised habitats, were selected to investigate the influence of habitat on specificity.  
 
 Seed from the common species Caladenia arenicola germinated on fungal isolates from adult plants of both C. arenicola and its rare and endangered relative C. huegelii, while seed from C. huegelii only germinated on its own fungal isolates.  The AFLP analysis grouped the fungal isolates into three categories: nonefficaceous fungi, C. huegelii type fungi, and C. arenicola type fungi.  The group of C. huegelii type fungi included some fungal isolates from C. arenicola.  An analysis of the AFLP fingerprints of C. arenicola fungal isolates from different collection locations showed that some, but not all, populations were genetically distinct, and that one population in particular was very variable.  
 
 Despite being thought to have very specific mycorrhizal relationships, Caladenia species hybridise frequently and prolifically in nature, often forming self-perpetuating hybrid lineages.  Five natural hybrids within Caladenia and its closest relatives were investigated.  Symbiotic cross-germination studies of parental and hybrid seed on fungi from the species and the naturally occurring hybrids were compared with AFLP analyses of the fungal isolates to answer the question of which fungi the hybrids use.  The germination study found that, while hybrid seeds can utilise the fungi from either parental species under laboratory conditions, it is likely that the natural hybrids in situ utilise the fungus of only one parental species.  Supporting these observations, the AFLP analyses indicated that while the parental species always possessed genetically distinct fungal strains, the hybrids may share the mycorrhizal fungus of one parental species or possess a genetically distinct fungal strain which is more closely related to the fungus of one parental species than the other.  
 
 The work on Caladenia hybrids revealed that C. falcata has a broadly compatible fungus that germinated seeds of C. falcata, the hybrid C. falcata x longicauda, and species with different degrees of taxonomic affinity to C. falcata.  In general, germination was greater from species that were more closely related to C. falcata: seeds from Caladenia species generally germinated well on most C. falcata isolates; species from same subtribe (Caladeniinae) germinated well to the stage of trichome development on only some of the fungal isolates and rarely developed further; and seeds from species from different subtribes (Diuridinae, Prasophyllinae, Thelymitrinae) or tribes (Orchideae, Cranichideae) either germinated well to the stage of trichome development but did not develop further, or did not germinate at all.  The AFLP analysis of the fungal isolates revealed that the fungi from each location were genetically distinct.  
 
 In situ seed baiting was used to study the introduction, growth and persistence of orchid mycorrhizal fungi.  A mycorrhizal fungus from Caladenia arenicola was introduced to sites within an area from which the orchid and fungus were absent, adjacent to a natural population of C. arenicola.  In the first growing season, the fungus grew up to 50 cm from its introduction point, usually persisted over the summer drought into the second season and even into the third season, stimulating germination and growth to tuber formation of the seeds in the baits.  Watering the inoculated areas significantly increased seed germination.  
 
 Mycorrhizal relationships in Drakaeinae were less specific than in Caladeniinae.  A study of the species Spiculaea ciliata revealed that this species, when germinated symbiotically, develops very rapidly and has photosynthetic protocorms, unlike all other members of the Drakaeinae.  An AFLP analysis of the fungal isolates of this species grouped the isolates according to whether they had been isolated from adult plants or reisolated from protocorms produced in vitro.  Isolates were genetically distinct when compared before germination and after reisolation.  A cross-species symbiotic germination study of seeds of three Drakaea species and one Paracaleana species against fungal isolates from the same species and several other Drakaeinae species revealed lower specificity in this group than previously thought.  A number of fungal isolates from Drakaea and Paracaleana species germinated two or more seed types, while all seed types germinated on fungal isolates from other species and the seed of Drakaea thynniphila germinated to some extent on every fungal isolate tested.  An AFLP analysis of the Drakaeinae fungal isolates supported this information, revealing little genetic differentiation between the fungi of different orchid species.  
 
 An ex situ seed baiting technique was used to examine the role of mycorrhizal fungi in microniche specialisation in the narrow endemic Drakaea.  Soil samples from within and outside two Drakaea populations were tested for germination of the relevant seed types.  In both cases, germination was significantly higher on soil samples from within than outside the populations, suggesting that the relevant mycorrhizal fungi may be restricted to the same microniches as the Drakaea species.  The presence of similar fungi at distant, disjunct locations may be related to the extreme age and geological stability of the Western Australian landscape.  
 
 The information from these investigations is essential for developing protocols for reintroduction and translocation of orchid species.  It appears that the mycorrhizal relationships in these groups of orchids are not as specific as was previously thought.  For reintroduction work, a broad sampling strategy is necessary, as it cannot be assumed that the same orchid species has the same fungus at different locations.  A broadly compatible fungus may be of considerable utility in conservation work, such as in situations where a specific fungus appears to have poor saprophytic competence or where soil conditions have been altered.  Seed baiting studies provide additional data on fungal distribution in situ.  In general, molecular data do not provide information about efficacy or fungal distribution, so research programs that combine symbiotic germination studies with seed baiting investigations and genetic analyses of the fungi will provide the maximum benefit for designing more effective conservation programs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/103/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic management accounting and managerial decision-making reconceptualised: towards a collaboratively oriented theory of organizational decision enhancement (ODE)</field><field name="creator">Holloway, David</field><field name="description">This thesis critically assesses the literature on strategic management accounting that is budgeting and corporate governance and also the managerial decision-making literature (primarily in the areas of strategic planning and change management). It is essentially a theory building and analytical thesis utilising a critical social sciene approach. The main aim is the construction of a collaborative theory of decision-making and associated methodology that will underpin and explain a more 'robust' construction of decision outcomes within an individual organizational context.
 
 In doing so it evaluates and synthesises Habermas's theory of communicative action with the intention of incorporating key elements as well as insights from Latour, complexity theory and Peirce in relation to doubt-driven inquiry in a proposed collaboratively oriented theory of organizational decision enhancement (ODE). ODE theory is argued to be widely applicable in the decision-making process utilised by organizations (private, public and non-profit). The claims implicit within the theory and its associated decision-making methodology are assessed empirically at the strategic planning level. This was part of an action research project commenced in July 2001 with Tertiary Institution?s current strategic planning round covering the planning time horizon 2003-2007.
 
 ODE theory postulates that effective decision-making in a world of uncertainty is best undertaken in a practical and collaborative group process. The theory, that I have derived, is stated as follows: 
 
 Optimal decision-making which a particular group of decision makers can construct in a world of uncertainty and risk is a pragmatic, recursive and democratised process. The process minimises the role of individual power, authority, self-interest and ego. This collaborative approach focuses on the force of the 'better argument', utilises constructive conflict (CC) and continuous, conscious, collaborative adaptation (CCCA) and results in the selection and monitoring of a 'best-option' decision outcome.
 
 The theory minimises the role of power and authority, focuses on the Habermasian concept of the force of the 'better argument', maximises the utility of resistance to change and results in the selection of a 'best-alternative' option that is subjected to a rigorous, performance measure-based monitoring feedback loop. In so doing this thesis extends significantly the earlier extant literature on organizational decision-making. It effectively revisits the notion of teams and groups in the organizational context and argues for organizations to seriously consider 'reengineering' the decision-making methodology and approach to one that necessitates effective devolution and delegation of decision-making powers. I argue that organizations should allow for and promote a 'cascade' effect to let control, power, authority and collective responsibility filter down through the organizational layers.
 
 Effectiveness and not efficiency (falsely perceived as timely) should be the aim of well-constructed decision outcomes. The adaptability and self-organising capability of the workforce requires an inclusive, not exclusive, decision-making methodology to unlock and realise the full future potential of the organization.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/104/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement of seagrass photosynthesis using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry and its practical applications, specifically in regard to transplantation</field><field name="creator">Horn, Lotte</field><field name="description">Photosynthetic activity of three seagrass species, Posidonia sinuosa Cambridge et Kuo, Posidonia australis Hook. f. and Halophila ovalis (R. Br.) Hook., growing in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, was assessed using an underwater pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer (Diving-PAM). The study aimed to determine possible causes and the extent of stress to seagrasses during transplantation, so that rehabilitation efforts can be improved by reducing stress during the transplant process.
 
 Absorptance factors for each species were determined as 0.64 plus-minus 0.04 for P. sinuosa, 0.59 plus-minus 0.02 for P. australis and 0.55 plus-minus 0.02 for H. ovalis, which were substantially lower than previously reported photosynthetic absorption factors. Transmittance, reflectance and non-photosynthetic absorptance of light diverted between 35-45% of irradiance from use in photosynthesis. An investigation of potential errors during measurement of rapid light curves (RLCs) reinforced the importance of ensuring that leaves remained stationary in the Universal Sample Holder. Any movement of seagrass leaves resulted in incorrect measurements of electron transport rates (ETR).
 
 A study on seasonal photosynthetic rates of each species found that maximum ETR (ETRmax) varied seasonally and among species. The highest ETRmax for each species occurred during summer, when ambient irradiances were at a maximum, and decreased during autumn. H. ovalis had the highest overall ETRmax in summer, followed by P. australis and P. sinuosa. Effective quantum yield([Delta]F/Fm')of each species varied seasonally, changing inversely with irradiance, which agrees with previously reported studies. ETRmax for each species also showed a diurnal pattern coincident with irradiance throughout the day. The [Delta]F/Fm for all species demonstrated a diurnal decrease in photosynthetic efficiency coincident with the midday irradiance maximum. Large natural variation in ETR was detected in all species, indicating that the effects of external stress on ETR may be difficult to detect.
 
 Two adjacent, physically separated seagrass meadows were examined to determine if apparent visual differences between the sites were reflected by measured physical and photosynthetic characteristics. ETR, leaf area index and sediment grain size differed between sites, but [Delta]F/Fm', canopy height, shoot density and epiphyte biomass did not, indicating a poor connection between physical and photosynthetic characteristics at these two meadows. Therefore caution should be used when attempting to visually assess the photosynthetic activity of a site based on physical characteristics.
 
 Changes in photosynthetic activity were monitored to determine seagrass stress during transplantation, and post-transplantation recovery. Two transplantation methods, sprigs and plugs, were examined, and photosynthetic activity was compared before, during and after transplantation. ETRmax of sprigs took one to two months to increase to the same level recorded at a control meadow, primarily due to desiccation stress suffered during transport. The [Delta]F/Fm' decreased below 0.2 after transplantation, but fully recovered after three months. Survival of sprigs was reduced due to strong currents and heavy epiphytic fouling. The ETRmax of transplanted plugs (5, 10 and 15 cm diameter) took up to one week to recover to the same level recorded at a control meadow. Survival of plugs was reduced due to winter swells and storms. Since the leading human-controlled cause of transplant failure was desiccation stress, future transplanting efforts should endeavour to keep seagrasses submerged at all times during the transplanting process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/106/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building successful franchises: the influence of franchise heterogeneity and relationship management on franchise success</field><field name="creator">Inma, Chutarat</field><field name="description">Franchising is a form of business arrangement which has been claimed to offer a high possibility of business success. The reason for its growing support may be due to the benefits franchising offers to the individuals (franchisees), the organisations (franchisors), the public and the whole economy. The notion that franchising offers a successful guarantee for business operations warrants investigation into what factors contribute to likely success.
 
 The characteristics of franchise firms have been identified as a significant factor in ensuring franchise success. In this study, franchise firms were classified into four groups using hierarchical cluster analysis: the beginners, the developers, the growers and the matures. The profiles were tested against reported performance measures, indicating that franchise firms in the growing group outperform firms in other groups. However, this is only one component which may influence a successful franchise development.
 
 Relationship management is a second, critical area in building a strong franchise network. Some significant relationship building factors are explored in this thesis.  Control, influence strategy, franchisee information asymmetry and communication strategy were found to be significant factors which lead to franchise competitive advantage.  The results show that control and coercive influence strategy negatively influence franchise outcomes, while noncoercive influence strategy, information asymmetry and communication strategy positively enhance the franchise relationship. The results of multiple regression analyses also indicate that the combined effects of these franchise strategies have a significant impact on franchise outcomes; namely,  financial performance, franchise goal congruence and franchisee satisfaction.  
 
 The findings suggest that franchise firms can adjust their strategies to enhance their business success.  Control, influence, information and information strategies can be used to maintain and induce healthy franchise relationships within the franchise dyad. The study also significantly extends the existing understanding of franchise heterogeneity theories, key criteria of franchise business competitiveness, the unique business relationship between franchisor and franchisee and franchise factors contributing to franchise success in the current franchising literature.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/107/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple arithmetic processing: fact retrieval mechanisms and the influence of individual difference, surface form, problem type and split on processing</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Natalie Deanne</field><field name="description">Current theorising in the area of cognitive arithmetic suggests that simple arithmetic knowledge is stored in memory and accessed in the same way as word knowledge i.e., it is stored in a network of associations, with simple facts retrieved automatically from memory. However, to date, the main methodologies that have been employed to investigate automaticity in simple arithmetic processing (e.g., production and verification) have produced a wide variety of difficulties in interpretation. In an attempt to address this, the present series of investigations utilised a numerical variant of the well established single word semantic priming paradigm that involved the presentation of problems as primes (e.g., 2 + 3) and solutions as targets (e.g., 5), as they would occur in a natural setting. Adult university students were exposed to both addition and multiplication problems in each of three main prime target relationship conditions, including congruent (e.g., 2 + 3 and 5), incongruent (e.g., 2 + 3 and 13), and neutral conditions (X + Y and 5). When combined with a naming task and the use of short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), this procedure enabled a more valid and reliable investigation into automaticity and the cognitive mechanisms underlying simple arithmetic processing. 
 
 The first investigation in the present series addressed the question of automaticity in arithmetic fact retrieval, whilst the remaining investigations examined the main factors thought to influence simple arithmetic processing i.e., skill level, surface form, problem type and split. All factors, except for problem type, were found to influence processing in the arithmetic priming paradigm. For example, the results of all five investigations were consistent in revealing significant facilitation in naming congruent targets for skilled participants, following exposure to Arabic digit primes at the short SOA. Accordingly, the facilitation was explained in terms of the operation of an automatic spreading activation mechanism. Additionally, significant inhibitory effects in incongruent target naming were identified in skilled performance in all of the studies in the present series of investigations. Throughout the course of these investigations, these effects were found to vary with operation, surface form and SOA, and in the final investigation, the level of inhibition was found to vary with the split between the correct solution and the incongruent target. Consequently, a number of explanations were put forward to account for these effects. In the first two investigations, it was suggested that the inhibitory effects resulted from the use of a response validity checking mechanism, whilst in the final investigation, the results were more consistent with the activation of magnitude representations in memory (this can be likened to Dehaene's, 1997, 'number sense'). In contrast, the results of the third investigation led to the proposal that for number word primes, inhibition in processing results from the activation of phonological representations in memory, via a reading based mechanism.     
 
 The present series of investigations demonstrated the utility of the numerical variant of the single word semantic priming paradigm for the investigation of simple arithmetic processing. Given its capacity to uncover the fundamental cognitive mechanisms at work in simple arithmetic operations, this methodology has many applications in future research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/108/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occurrence and variation of Endothiella eucalypti in Eucalyptus globulus plantations of south-western Australia and the influence of some biotic and abiotic factors on the response of the host to the pathogen</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Tania Joy</field><field name="description">As the Eucalyptus globulus plantation industry expands and matures in southwestern Australia (WA), the impact of disease within the plantation environment is predicted to increase. This thesis investigated the most abundant canker-causing pathogen associated with branch and stem cankers, Endothiella eucalypti the anamorph of Cryphonectria eucalypti. Endothiella eucalypti was widespread, although at low incidence, throughout the WA plantation estate and was frequently observed sporulating on the bark of healthy hosts in the absence of disease. Regions with a long (approximately 20 years) plantation history, such as Bunbury, had the highest incidence of this pathogen. A high degree of variability in pathogenicity, growth rate and colony morphology was observed between WA isolates of En. eucalypti.
 
 In the glasshouse, a significant variation in susceptibility of seven E. globulus provenances to En. eucalypti was observed. Although an interaction between the E. globulus provenance and En. eucalypti isolate was recorded, some provenances were generally more susceptible than others. In two 18-month-old plantations, the susceptibility of three provenances to En. eucalypti was significantly influenced by environmental conditions. Visual assessment of general tree health indicated that less healthy trees had smaller lesions than healthy trees. It is hypothesised that the selection of E. globulus provenances to suit site conditions in the future should decrease the risk of serious disease, especially on marginal sites.
 
 Endothiella eucalypti caused disease in intact stems of two-year-old E. globulus under glasshouse conditions. This suggests that En. eucalypti may not require a wound to infect in the field.
 
 Vegetative compatibility groupings between WA En. eucalypti isolates indicated a relatively high degree of genotypic diversity within the WA asexual population of En. eucalypti, whereas inter-simple sequence repeats PCR (ISSR-PCR) analysis indicated a lower level of genotypic diversity. Discrepancies between traditional and molecular techniques, such as ISSR-PCR, was attributed to the more specific gene-togene analysis afforded by molecular techniques. ISSR-PCR successfully distinguished variability within the En. eucalypti population and with the teleomorph, isolated in South Africa. It also separated Cryphonectria cubensis isolates from the C. eucalypti isolates.
 
 As copper is the micronutrient most limiting growth of E. globulus in WA, its role in the resistance of two E. globulus provenances was examined in a glasshouse trial. Lesion extension or defence responses of E. globulus to En. eucalypti did not differ between Cu-adequate and Cu-deficient plants. It is suggested that constitutive levels of host defence enzymes played a more important role in providing protection for the host against En. eucalypti than the external supply of copper.
 
 A reduction in the canopy volume of E. globulus within plantations due to insect herbivory or foliar pathogens, such as Mycosphaerella spp., has been reported to predispose the host to disease caused by non-aggressive canker-causing fungi. Under two separate glasshouse trials, conditions of 100% defoliation and 80% defoliation maintained over six weeks prior to inoculation, were required to significantly increase lesion extension caused by En. eucalypti in E. globulus stems. The ability of defoliated E. globulus to retain a degree of resistance to En. eucalypti was attributed to the rapid replacement of foliage and up-regulation of photosynthesis in remaining leaves. The carbohydrate reserves of the plant were depleted following defoliation and remained depressed regardless of the length of time the trees remained defoliated.
 
 In conclusion, the endophytic habit of En. eucalypti poses a threat to highly stressed trees, however it does not appear to be an immediate threat to WA plantation health. Although En. eucalypti has not yet been responsible for a major disease outbreak in WA, the impact of this disease on plantation-grown eucalypts elsewhere in Australia and worldwide serves as an indication of its potential to affect WA plantations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/109/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising the concentration of glycogen in lamb meat</field><field name="creator">Jacob, Robin Henry</field><field name="description">The lamb industry is actively seeking to improve the quality of lamb meat produced in Australia.  Ultimate pH (pHu) is a key determinant of red meat eating quality although this measurement has not been adopted formally by the Australian lamb meat industry.  Muscle glycogen concentration is a major determinant of pHu in red meat. This thesis investigates glycogen concentration in lamb muscle and the ultimate pH (pHu) of lamb meat under commercial industry conditions as well as exploring by experimentation, some of the factors that control muscle glycogen concentration in lamb muscle.  The results of this work has contributed to an understanding of the significance of high pHu meat to the lamb industry and will assist with developing new management strategies for lambs that avoid low muscle glycogen concentration at the point of slaughter, thus high pHu in meat derived from lambs. 
 
 The first part of the study (Experiments 1 and 2) undertook to determine the ranges of muscle glycogen concentration and lamb meat pHu found under commercial conditions and to measure any changes in these parameters associated with consignment of lambs from farm to abattoir and lairage at abattoirs.  This study utilised a new biopsy technique that allowed muscle collection from lambs on farm.  Some 16 different consignments of lambs and 3 consignments of lactating ewes were intensively monitored on farm and at abattoirs over a range of lairage times.  Sensory evaluation tests were done using meat from 6 of these consignments.  
 
 The results showed there to be considerable variation between lamb consignments with some consignments having a very high and other consignments having a very low incidence of meat with a high pHu.  On balance 'on farm' factors were concluded to have a greater impact on muscle glycogen concentration at slaughter than 'post farm gate' factors.  However, there was evidence that muscle glycogen concentrations decreased during the farm curfew and transport period for some consignments so both 'on farm' and 'post farm gate factors' can be important.  Characteristically glycogen loss occurred during the farm curfew and transport period in consignments of Merino lambs that had high muscle glycogen concentrations prior to consignment.  Holding lambs in lairage caused no negative effects on muscle glycogen concentration although there was some evidence that very short lairage periods may increase meat pHu without causing a change in muscle glycogen concentration.  It was concluded from these experiments that the mean muscle glycogen concentration of a group of lambs needs to be greater than 1.5 g/100g on farm in order for the pHu of lamb meat to be less than 5.7.  
 
 Subsequent to this industry study, an experiment (Experiment 3) was done to gain an understanding of muscle glycogen concentration as being an integral part of whole body glucose metabolism.  This experiment investigated the effects of exercise on a range of different muscles and tissues of lambs including liver, kidney, skin and gastrointestinal tract.  Interactions between glycogen concentrations in the liver and muscle with time after exercise showed that glycogen repletion occurred in the liver before muscle tissue.  This effect was a unique finding and could explain in part the slow rate of glycogen repletion in muscle tissue that is characteristic for ruminants.  Another major finding was an accumulation of glycogen concentration in skin during the recovery period after exercise.  It was postulated that this effect may be due to the supply of glucose to glycolytic tissues being continued even when demand for glucose in the skin was low and the capacity to store glycogen in muscle was very high. 
 
 Experiment 3 confirmed the existence of a relationship between metabolisable energy (ME) intake and glycogen repletion in muscle tissues and found a slightly different relationship between ME intake and glycogen repletion in the liver tissue of lambs.  Muscle glycogen concentration did not change in fasted lambs and the rate of glycogen repletion in muscle after exercise was dependent on ME intake.  Differences were observed between different muscles, particularly between M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) and all other muscles, in relation to the change in glycogen concentration with time after exercise.  Glycogen concentrations changed less rapidly in the LTL than other muscles.  Glycogen concentration in the liver was associated negatively with time after exercise in fasted lambs and positively with time after exercise in fed lambs.  
 
 Several experiments (Experiments 4, 5 and 6) were conducted to determine the affects of different nutritional factors on muscle glycogen concentration in lambs, both on farm and after commercial slaughter.  These studies showed that short term increases in ME intake will increase muscle glycogen concentration to a maximum level over a period of about 7 days (Experiment 4).  Diet composition did not affect the change in muscle glycogen concentration associated with an increase in ME intake although results from this experiment (Experiment 5) were not entirely conclusive.  There was evidence that the type of feeding and finishing system may influence the susceptibility of muscle glycogen concentration to change during consignment of lambs to slaughter.  Results from these experiments demonstrated that a goal for muscle glycogen concentration in lambs on farm of 1.5g/100g is quite achievable with contemporaneous management systems.
 
 Finally this study highlighted the need for further research in a number of key areas in order that muscle glycogen concentration in lambs to be fully understood.  In particular, the role of muscle glycogen turnover in relation to muscle glycogen concentration was noted as an area for which further research is warranted.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/110/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precipitation and characteristics of iron (III) oxyhydroxides from acid liquors</field><field name="creator">Jamieson, Evan J.</field><field name="description">An important problem in the mineral processing industry is the removal of iron (III) from process and waste streams by precipitation as the metal hydroxide by elevation of pH. Caustic (NaOH),lime(CaO) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2,), are cheap and effective reagents for this purpose, however iron (III) oxyhydroxides often form polymeric chains when precipitated at ambient temperature. This gelatinous material is slow to settle and difficult to filter, unlike the crystalline solids obtained at higher temperature.
 
 A systematic fundamental study was undertaken to assess the suitability of various characterisation techniques to the iron oxide and oxyhydroxide group of minerals. Techniques such as chemical dissolution methods, surface area, TEM and thermal gravimetry were found to be very useful for comparative purposes, but were not recommended as primary characterisation techniques. Mossbauer spectroscopy proved to be the most reliable method for deteimination of phase composition especially when used in conjunction with XRD. However cost and time for analysis prevent this technique being used extensively. It was found that XRD, settling rate and settled sediment volume were broadly applicable and able to identify variation between samples cheaply and efficiently.
 
 This study also methodically compared the settling rates, sediment volumes and iron oxide phases associated with using caustic solution, dry and slaked lime and dry and slaked magnesia.
 
 Pure sodium hydroxide and iron (III) chloride solutions were used to represent the simplest system Factors such as temperature, mixing, neutralisation rate, heterogeneous precipitation sulphate addition, the presence of divalent cations (Mg2') and strong iron (III) ligands (eg citrate, oxalate) were investigated with this system Generally the predominant iron phase precipitated was the poor order 0 or 2 XRD .line ferrihydrite. The temperature during precipitation was found to be the only critical parameter in changing product crystallinity and morphology. However, some other factors were able to produce small changes in agglomeration and settling rates, suggesting processes such as pulp recycle may prove beneficial. The iron (III) sulphate system induced a change in precipitates producing microcrystalline goethite, although settling rates were not improved.
 
 The use of slowly dissolving lime in the iron (III chloride system was unable to improve precipitate crystallinity or settling rate, however results suggest that lime and caustic can be used interchangeably. The lime / iron (III) sulphate system produced a co precipitate of ferrihydrite and gypsum of enhanced settling ability relative to the caustic system.
 
 The use of sparingly soluble magnesia failed to improve the precipitate of the iron (m) chloride system, however substantial improvement was found in the crystallinity and settling rate when using the iron (III) sulphate and mixed chloride / sulphate system, provided a range of conditions were met. This product resembled dense amorphous basic ferric sulphate (DABFS) and was identified as a highly ordered form of ferrihydrite by Mossbauer studies. It is suggested that this precipitate may form the basis for a new low temperature industrial precipitation process.
 
 To further investigate the iron precipitation process, iron (II) and mixed iron (II)/(III) chloride solutions were hydrolysed with the addition of sodium hydroxide, calcium oxide and magnesium oxide under well aerated conditions. Dense maghemite was produced with the caustic system at ambient temperature which settled faster than magnetite precipitated at 70 degrees C. The divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ appear to hinder precipitation of crystalline maghemite at ambient temperature, forming the gelatinous poorly ordered ferrihydrite.
 
 This fundamental and systematic study of the precipitation process of iron oxides and oxyhydroxides has led to an improvement in the integral understanding of iron (III) hydrolysis. The investigation of characterisation techniques has also led to an enhanced knowledge of their interaction with these precipitates and hence their strengths and weaknesses.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/111/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote indigenous housing system: a systems social assessment</field><field name="creator">Jardine Orr, Andrea</field><field name="description">Indigenous Australians make up a mere 2.4% of the population of whom around a quarter live in remote and very remote parts of Australia. The poor state of Indigenous housing in remote areas is generally acknowledged as one of Australia's most intractable housing problems. The thesis examines why the remote Indigenous housing system does not meet the housing needs of Indigenous people in remote areas and discusses an alternative system.
 
 The aim of the thesis is to understand why the remote Indigenous housing system is not meeting people's needs, despite policy statements that emphasise empowerment and partnerships. This understanding of the current remote Indigenous housing system involved placing it in historical, policy and international contexts and examining the current attempts to rationalise and streamline the system.
 
 The service-delivery concepts of supply-driven (externally prescribed) and demand-responsive (community determined) are applied to remote Indigenous housing. The characteristics of successful remote Indigenous housing, namely Indigenous control and self-determination, an enabling environment and a culturally responsive system, are developed and found to be characteristic of a demand-responsive system. The research hypothesises that the remote Indigenous housing system's supply-driven focus is largely responsible for the housing needs of Indigenous people in remote areas not being met.
 
 This was tested using the new methodology of a Systems Social Assessment which is developed by combining Social Assessment and Checkland's Soft Systems Methodology.
 
 This methodology illustrated that the current remote Indigenous housing system has a supply-driven focus where the housing 'solutions' are controlled and largely provided from an external source, in this case the Commonwealth and State governments and their agents. The thesis discusses an alternative demand-responsive focus where remote communities have more control over the nature and delivery of their housing that may prove more successful.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/112/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'No more head stockman, he's a chairman now': the making and breaking of the pastoral system in the Kimberley Ranges, 1903-1972</field><field name="creator">Jebb, Mary Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis examines Aboriginal pastoral workers' life stories in the context of the two mass movements in Kimberley history: the move toward pastoral stations in the 'early days' of this century and away from them in the 1960s and 1970s. In the northern ranges region of the Kimberley pastoral settlement began in 1903, with a second phase of intense settlement from 1920. The recency of settlement in this region meant that in the late 1980s people were alive who had experienced both 'first contact' and the arrival of 'Welfare'. This study places Aboriginal life story narratives in a wider historical context, drawn from written archives and a range of oral testimonies about the origins and development of the pastoral system in the north and central Kimberley. The broader economic and political context which affected the process of incorporating northern ranges people into the Australian nation is examined through individual contacts and biographies to develop the patterns of alliances with 'Bosses' and the impact of Welfare on those relationships.
 
 In 1971, small reserves on the outskirts of Kimberley towns which catered for 20 to 40 people in the 1950s, held up to 300 residents who were previously living on pastoral stations. The overcrowded and unserviced fringe camps were thought to contain people displaced from station employment by the decision to enforce equal wages for Aborigines in the pastoral industry. It is one of the contentions of this thesis that the social and economic foundations of the old rationing system on most of the stations in the northern Kimberley were crumbling before the award wages decision and its application to the Kimberley in 1969. The 'eviction after award wages' theme underestimates Aboriginal agency in the migration process, fails to take account of their changing social and economic requirements and the pull of Welfare support, glorifies the period of 'settlement' on stations and reinforces the 'myth of the lazy native' which underpinned public debate and Arbitration Commission discussions in the 1960s about the inclusion of Aboriginal workers within the Pastoral Industry Award.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/113/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emerging canine tick-borne diseases in Australia and phylogenetic studies of the canine Piroplasmida</field><field name="creator">Jefferies, Ryan</field><field name="description">Canine tick-borne diseases are an emerging problem within Australia and throughout the world. This thesis investigates Babesia gibsoni and Anaplasma platys infections in dogs in Australia and also explores the evolutionary relationships and taxonomy of the canine piroplasm species and the members of the order Piroplasmida.
 
 A nested PCR-RFLP assay was developed for the detection and differentiation of the canine piroplasm species and was found to have a high detection limit, capable of detecting a 2.7 x 10-7 % parasitaemia or the equivalent of 1.2 molecules of target DNA. Detection of piroplasm DNA applied to Whatman FTA classic cards using nested-PCR was found to have a lower detection limit than when using DNA extracted from whole blood but higher than IsoCode Stix or QIAamp extraction from filter paper based techniques. The nested PCR-RFLP assay was further evaluated for the detection of B. gibsoni infection in dogs being exported from Australia to New Zealand and compared to the current screening methods, the Immunofluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) and microscopy. Of 235 dogs screened, 11 were IFAT positive, 1 was microscopy positive and 3 were PCR positive for B. gibsoni, highlighting the discordance that exists between various detection techniques. Replacing microscopic examination of blood smears with PCR-RFLP is suggested for screening dogs entering New Zealand, in addition to revising the current IFAT cut-off titre to minimize false positive results. The first case of B. gibsoni in New South Wales is also reported.
 
 A study was also conducted to further investigate the recent discovery of B. gibsoni in Australia and the association of this infection with American Pit Bull Terriers in an epidemiological study. Both American Pit Bull Terriers (n = 100) and other dog breeds (n = 51) were screened for B. gibsoni using IFAT and PCR-RFLP. A questionnaire was also completed by each dog owner regarding thethe husbandry and habits these dogs. Fourteen dogs were positive for B. gibsoni using IFAT and/or PCR-RFLP and all were American Pit Bull Terriers. Dogs that were male and/or were bitten by or were biters of other American Pit Bull Terriers were statistically more likely to be B. gibsoni positive, thus suggesting that blood-to-blood transmission may contribute to the spread of this disease. 
 
 Experimental B. gibsoni infections were established in vivo to investigate the efficacy of combined atovaquone and azithromycin therapy and to determine the detection limits of PCR, IFAT and microscopy during various stages of infection. While atovaquone and azithromycin produced a reduction in circulating parasite levels, it did not cause total eradication, and possible drug resistance also developed in one dog. PCR was found to be most useful in detecting early and acute stage infections, while IFAT was most useful during chronic and acute infections. Microscopy is suggested to be only useful for detecting acute stage infections. This study also describes the detection of B. gibsoni in tissue samples during chronic infection for the first time, suggesting possible sequestration of this parasite.
 
 Anaplasma platys has also only recently been reported in Australia and the distribution, molecular-charcterisation, pathogenesis, co-infection with Babesia canis vogeli and treatment of infection with doxycycline were investigated. For the first time, A. platys is reported in Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria, with each isolate found to be genetically identical on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene. No correlation could be established between A. platys infection and the development of clinical signs or pathogenesis and definitive treatment using doxycycline could not be determined.
 
 Isolates of canine piroplasms from various geographical locations worldwide (n = 46), including Australia were characterised on the basis of multiple gene loci to explore the distribution, genetic variation and possible phylogeographical relationships of these species. Separate genotypes of B. canis vogeli, B. canis canis and B. gibsoni are suggested and may be correlated to different geographical origins. Characterization of B. canis vogeli, B. canis canis and B. canis rossi on the basis of the HSP 70 gene and B. gibsoni on the basis of the ITS 1, 5.8S rRNA gene and ITS 2 is described for the first time. Elevation of each of the B. canis subspecies, with the exclusion of B. canis presentii, to separate species is also proposed.
 
 The current paraphyly and taxonomic confusion associated with the members of the order Piroplasmida led to a review of the phylogenetic and taxonomic status of this group of organisms. Phylogenetic relationships are determined using 18S rRNA gene, 5.8S rRNA gene, HSP 70 gene and combined loci analyses. Rearrangement of the Piroplasmida into three families, including the new family Piroplasmiidae is proposed, in addition to the establishment of two new genera, the Piroplasma (Patton, 1895) and the Achromaticus (Dionisi, 1899). Other proposed schemes of classification and the limitations of phenotypic characteristics in taxonomic classification within the Piroplasmida are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/114/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voyages from the centre to the margins: an ethnography of long term ocean cruisers</field><field name="creator">Jennings, Gayle Ruth</field><field name="description">Long term ocean cruisers are self defined as people who have accepted, adopted or chosen a cruising lifestyle, who live aboard their own sailing vessels, have independent means, are self sufficient and have been away from their port of departure for an extended period of time. As a group, cruisers, constitute a subculture (Macbeth, 1985).
 
 Why do people choose to adopt a cruising lifestyle? Using the principles of grounded theory analysis, this study found that cruisers were motivated by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations as well as by their social background and status in society. Cruisers were motivated by a need to escape the pressures and constraints of their home society as well as to pursue a lifestyle which offered freedom and a sense of personal control, a need to add some adventure or challenge to their lives or to fulfil a dream. They were also motivated by relationship commitments and a desire to travel and experience new cultures, people and settings. Their age, gender, family life cycle stage, education, income and former lifestyle pursuits also motivated them. In setting about and maintaining the fulfilment of their motivations, cruisers exhibited personal agency in their choice to move from a life in the centre of mainstream western societies to one in the margins.
 
 Overall, cruisers were found to be social actors who exhibit agency and self governance in decision making as to whether or not to maintain a sense of 'connectivity' with and without various social settings. Cruisers' responses to feelings of anomie and alienation in their home societies, to their feelings of under or non-actualisation at the individual level, and to their need for belonging with a partner activated these people to make choices and decisions regarding the negotiation and direction of their own social realities. Based on the cruisers who participated in this study, such agency and self governance can be described as 'empowered connectivity'. Empowered connectivity is the action of exhibiting agency in order to achieve connectivity with the space in which an individual currently finds her or himself. It can be both a holding on to and a letting go of connections. Empowered connectivity is not a 'theory' per se, but rather a generic representation of a process that accounts for 'plurality, multiplicity and difference'(Tong 1989) in the actions of both women and men as they negotiate the spaces they choose to occupy.
 
 Moreover, this study informed by the interpretive social sciences paradigm and, a 'feminist methodology' enabled an indepth understanding of cruising women's experiences to be counterpointed against cruising men's experiences. Subsequently, cruising women became subjects in their own right rather than 'other'. Further, the interpretive social sciences paradigm and 'feminist methodology' emphasised the need for tourism research, in particular, to use both ernic and etic perspectives in data collection and analysis.
 
 This ethnographic study of cruisers was conducted between 1985 and 1999 on the eastern seaboard of Australia.

 This dissertation examines the erosion of minority rights in Malaysia through the implementation of special measures in favour of the majority Malays. This dissertation will consider the appropriateness, effectiveness and legitimacy of these special measures under current international law standards. This involves a comparison of Malaysia's constitutional, legislative and statutory provisions with international principles of customary and treaty law, and applicable regional declarations. This dissertation will conclude by recommending appropriate policy and legislative reform, if such measures are found to be appropriate in the circumstances.
 
 Preamble
 
 Malaysia achieved independence from Britain on 31 August 1957. The Merdeka Independence Proclamation declared that the nation was to be 'founded upon the principle of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of its people'. Insightful words for a nation built upon by racial, cultural and religious separatism, as the term 'its people' was presumably meant to encompass both the majority Malays as well as all ethnic minorities.' Unfortunately, the sentiment expressed in the Merdeka proclamation was marred by ethnic polarisation and its resultant ethnocentric legal and political system.
 
 The reasons for this will be explored in chapter one, which considers Malaysia's historical and cultural development and the eventual mass pluralisation of Malaysia without a unifying national identity. An understanding of the formation of Malaysia's cultural hegemony, and its subsequent ethnic polarisation, is required to appreciate the current status of Malaysia's ethnic minorities. Part A will consider in detail the preferential policies in favour of Malays introduced by the government following the 1969 race riots and the resulting effect this had on the economic, social and cultural rights of non-Malays. The introduction of these policies also led to the implementation of race based quota systems in the education, employment and business sectors. Correspondingly, the socio-economic position of non-Malay minorities have been affected. The legal implications of these policies are discussed in the proceeding chapters and the reasonableness of these policies will be measured against international law standards.
 
 To undertake this assessment, Part B discusses the role of international law and examines its implications to Malaysia. It should be noted from the outset that although Malaysia is a member State of the United Nations, it has elected not to ratify significant human rights treaties. Given this, chapter two considers the role of customary law as a part of international law and its implications to the observance of fundamental human rights. This chapter aims to establish that Malaysia as a member of the United Nations, and by virtue of customary law, is bound to recognise fundamental human rights.
 
 As this dissertation discusses Malaysia's observance of minority rights at international law, part C examines the availability of fundamental human rights to Malaysia's minorities. Part C reconciles Malaysia's pro-Malay preferential policies with minority rights and considers whether minority rights in Malaysia have been eroded through such policies pursuant to international law standards. Chapter four determines whether the language rights of Malaysia's non-bahasa speakers, who also constitute the ethnic minorities, are recognised and protected by Malaysia's national language policy. This chapter also assesses the impact of Malaysia's national language policy and planning on the education and employment rights of non-Malays given the introduction of language based quota systems in both sectors. Chapter five examines the role of Islam in Malaysia and considers the extent of religious freedom available to non-Muslims in Malaysia Chapter six deals with Malaysia's restrictive laws and how these laws were relied on to revise and modify Malaysia's legal system and policies to benefit Malays whilst simultaneously impacting on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of non-Malay minorities. Chapter six also considers the potential risks associated with the government's continued reliance on these restrictive laws to 'control' interethnic tensions.
 
 On the assumption that Malaysia has breached relevant international law standards in some instances, part D recommends possible methods of legislative and policy reform which may be adopted by the government to remedy these breaches. Part D is the concluding chapter of this dissertation. In concluding, this dissertation examines the impact of ethnic divisions on social and political policies in Malaysia and considers the extent of government intervention in the economy based on race which has ultimately impacted on the protection and implementation of minority rights in Malaysia. It is the writer's opinion that the source of ethnic conflict lies within the introduction of legal doctrines which are purposely detrimental to the rights of minorities. Accordingly, the concluding chapter recommends reforms to Malaysia's legal system and policies to minimise the risk of an eruption of inter-ethnic tensions.
 
 The aim of this dissertation is to demonstrate that Malaysia's politicisation of competing ethnic interests has resulted in the maintenance of preferential policies detrimental to minority rights and contrary to international law.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/116/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The free trade doctrine, regionalism, the ASEAN free trade area and their effects on trade and trade policy</field><field name="creator">Ariffin, Anuar</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a number of issues concerning the free trade doctrine, regionalism and Regional Free Trade Areas (FTAs), with a special focus on the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). This study is broadly divided into three parts. The first part examines the doctrine of free trade from the perspectives of ideological belief as well as theoretical expositions, and how these influence trade policies of many countries throughout the history of trade. The second part of the study analyses the forces that influence the formation of regionalism and regional FTAs all over the world. In the first and second parts, an extensive survey of the existing literature is undertaken to unearth relevant ideas and events, which are important to policy makers and the general public. 
 
 The third part of the study deals primarily with empirical investigation of the economic effects brought about by the formation of regional FTAs. Two main issues are examined in this part. The first issue is the assessment of the effects that regional FTAs have on trade of members against other countries that do not become members of any economic groupings. The second issue is the examination of the effect of AFTA on trade of member vis-a-vis non-member countries. In addition, this part also examines the question of whether AFTA 'creates' or 'diverts' trade. For the purpose of addressing issues grouped in this part of the study, a gravity model is employed to answer the questions of interest. This part of the study covers a period of 24 years (1980-2003). Cross sectional data involving 990 pairs of countries, which trade with each other, are used in regression analysis based on the Ordinary Least Square technique. 
 
 Findings from the first and second parts of the study indicate that trade between countries during the era of mercantilism (1500s-1750s) was carried out under enormous restrictions in consonance with the thinking of that time. However, by the end of eighteenth century the economic arguments in favour of free trade began to be accepted, resulting in the adoption of the free trade idea into the commercial policies of many countries, particularly in Europe in the middle of nineteenth century. The period characterized by unilateral free trade regimes lasted only about three decades, as protectionist elements made a return into trade policy formulation in the 1870s. The period of liberal trade policy regimes came to a complete end at the breakout of the First World War in 1914, and the protectionist trade policies of many countries continued to strengthen their grip until the Second World War.
	
 After WW2 ended in 1945, many countries realised that security and the orderly conduct of international trade were important to ensure continuous prosperity of the world. This led to series of negotiations involving major trading countries that resulted in the establishment of the GATT in 1947. The main thrust behind this initiative was that all trading nations must cooperate to liberalize their trade policies, reflecting the idea that countries should move towards adopting 'freer' trade policy than the regime they adopted in the 1930s and the early 1940s.   
 
 At the end of 1990s the world once again observed agreement amongst prominent trade economists for the case of pursuing free trade policy. This is due to the renewed recognition by economists of two important propositions: (1) if market failures remain unfixed, then pursing free trade policy can harm rather that help, and (2) if market failures are fixed through suitable policy interventions, then free trade can be used to exploit the potential gains from trade. Within the second proposition, economists emphasis that if market failures arise in domestic markets, then the most appropriate policy interventions would be to devise policies targeting at correcting those domestic market failures, while free trade is maintained externally.
 
 Findings from empirical assessment of the effects of regional FTAs on trade indicate that economic theory might be able to approximate reality. One important result of this part of the study suggests that three regional FTAs, AFTA, CER and MERCUSOR have had an intra-bloc trade intensifying effect in recent years, particularly since the early 2000s. This implies that trade among members of these economic groupings is higher than their trade with other countries. Meanwhile, the EU and NAFTA do not show an intra-bloc trade intensifying effect for any part of the study period. The other important result obtained by this study suggests that although AFTA member countries trade with each other, comparatively, more than their trade with the rest of the world, the intensity of trade between them is less pronounced for the period after the formation of AFTA. This implies that AFTA has the characteristic of an 'open trading bloc'. Lastly, the finding of this part of the study also suggests that AFTA essentially creates rather than diverts trade. This means that AFTA's establishment does not only increase trade among member countries but it also boosts trade with the rest of the world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/117/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemical studies on the cementation of copper and cobalt with zinc</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Xiong</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis deals mainly with a fundamental study of two cementation reactions, i.e., Cu(II)/Zn and Co(II)/Zn, using the electrochemical techniques of linear potential sweep voltammetry, cyclic vol tammetry, chronopotentiometry (stripping), capacitance measurements,ring current measurements and impedance spectroscopy. In addition, solution analysis, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were employed to achieve a better understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of the two cementations. The half reactions of the two systems were also investigated as an essential part of the whole study. Of the two systems investigated, the Cu(II)/Zn system, was mainly used as a reference system on which some of the new techniques could be proved.
 
 The Cu(II)/Zn reaction has been shown to be diffusion controlled. Five methods, including solution analysis, have been used to determine the rate of reaction. The values of the rate constants thus determined were in good agreement provided allowance was made for the nonstoichiometry of this reaction due to proton displacement by zinc.
 
 The Co(II)/Zn cementation reaction, though thermodynamically highly favourable, is kinetically very sluggish. Of the factors affecting this reaction, the solution pH was found to play a substantial role. For example, while the reaction is largely under chemical control, at pH 5 the reaction rate becomes limited by the speed at which cobalt(I1) ions diffuse to the reacting metal surface. The favourable influence of a higher pH on the reduction of cobalt(II) carried out either electrochemically or chemically using zinc powder was ascribed to the increasing formation of the electrochemically active species, CoOH+ . Increasing the temperature also favours the shift from chemical control to diffusion control.
 
 Values for the rate constants of the Co(II)/Zn reaction in the absence of added zn2+ ions were determined from Evans' diagram, chronopotentiometry and impedance spectroscopy, The reasons for the differences in the values of rate thus obtained were discussed.
 
 The presence of zinc ions in the reaction solution greatly suppressed the rate of Co(II)/Zn cementation reaction. Several factors have been identified as contributing to the reduced reaction rate. These are the double layer effect, zinc ion and hydrogen atom adsorption, and precipitation of basic zinc salts which blanket the reacting metal surface.
 
 The action of compounds such as Sb(III) and As(III), which are commonly used to activate the Co(II)/Zn reaction in the presence of large amounts of zn2+, was investigated mainly by impedance spectroscopy. From the similarity of the impedance spectra for the reaction i n the presence of benzoqui none, it was inferred that one role of the activators was to suppress the formation of adsorbed hydrogen on the reacting surface and to allow a higher concentration of the active species, COOH'.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/118/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic modelling and optimisation of carbon management strategies in gold processing</field><field name="creator">Jongpaiboonkit, Pornsawan</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development and application of a dynamic model of gold adsorption onto activated carbon in gold processing. The primary aim of the model is to investigate different carbon management strategies of the Carbon in Pulp (CIP) process. This model is based on simple film-diffusion mass transfer and the Freundlich isotherm to describe the equilibrium between the gold in solution and gold adsorbed onto carbon. A major limitation in the development of a dynamic model is the availability of accurate plant data that tracks the dynamic behaviour of the plant. This limitation is overcome by using a pilot scale CIP gold processing plant to obtain such data. All operating parameters of this pilot plant can be manipulated and controlled to a greater degree than that of a full scale plant. This enables a greater amount of operating data to be obtained and utilised.
 
 Two independent experiments were performed to build the model. A series of equilibrium tests were performed to obtain parameter values for the Freundlich isotherm, and results from an experimental run of the CIP pilot plant were used to obtain other model parameter values. The model was then verified via another independent experiment. The results show that for a given set of operating conditions, the simulated predictions were in good agreement with the CIP pilot plant experimental data.
 
 The model was then used to optimise the operations of the pilot plant. The evaluation of the plant optimisation simulations was based on an objective function developed to quantitatively compare different simulated conditions. This objective function was derived from the revenue and costs of the CIP plant. The objective function costings developed for this work were compared with published data and were found to be within the published range. This objective function can be used to evaluate the performance of any CIP plant from a small scale laboratory plant to a full scale gold plant. The model, along with its objective function, was used to investigate different carbon management strategies and to determine the most cost effective approach. A total of 17 different carbon management strategies were investigated. An additional two experimental runs were performed on the CIP pilot plant to verify the simulation model and objective function developed.
 
 Finally an application of the simulation model is discussed. The model was used to generate plant data to develop an operational classification model of the CIP process using machine learning algorithms. This application can then be used as part of an online diagnosis tool.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/119/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood</field><field name="creator">Kawka, Adela</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to revisit the properties of white dwarf stars in the Solar neighbourhood (distance &gt; 100 pc), in particular their magnetic fields, the occurrence of binarity and their space density. This thesis presents observations and analysis of a sample of white dwarfs from the southern hemisphere. Over 80 objects were observed spectroscopically, and 65 of these were also observed with a spectropolarimeter. Many of the white dwarfs observed belong to the Solar neighbourhood, and can be used to study the star formation and evolution in this region.
 
 Our spectropolarimetric measurements helped constrain the fraction of magnetic white dwarfs in the Solar neighbourhood. Combining data from different surveys, I found a higher fraction of these objects in the relatively old local population than in other younger selections such as the Palomar-Green survey which suggests magnetic field evolution in white dwarfs, or different sets of progenitors. The progenitors of magnetic white dwarfs have been assumed to be Ap and Bp stars, however I find that the properties and number of Ap and Bp stars would only explain white dwarfs with magnetic fields larger than 100 MG. The number of known white dwarfs is believed to be complete to about 13 pc, however the sample is certainly incomplete to 20 pc from the Sun. To identify new white dwarfs in the Solar neighbourhood, some possibly magnetic or in binaries, numerous candidate white dwarfs from the Revised NLTT catalogue have been observed, which resulted in the discovery of 13 new white dwarfs, with 4 of these having a distance that places them within 20 pc of the Sun. The candidates were selected using a V - J reduced-proper-motion diagram and optical-infrared diagram. A total of 417 white dwarf candidates were selected, 200 of these have already been spectroscopically confirmed as white dwarfs.
 
 Spectroscopic confirmation is required for the remaining 217 candidates, many of these are likely to belong to the Solar neighbourhood. Four close binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a cool companion were also observed, for which atmospheric and orbital parameters were obtained. The photometry for two of these binary systems, BPM 71214 and EC 13471-1258 shows that the secondary stars are filling their Roche lobes, and combined with their orbital parameters, these systems are very good candidates for hibernating novae. The time of their previous interaction or the extent of this interaction are unknown. The two other binary systems, BPM 6502 and EUVE J0720-31.7 are post-common envelope binaries. BPM 6502 is not expected to interact within a Hubble time, however EUVE J0720-31 is expected to become a cataclysmic variable within a Hubble time. The atmospheric parameters of the white dwarfs were determined using model atmosphere codes which were modified for the present study to include convective energy transfer, self-broadening and Lyman satellite features.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/120/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You have to hit some people, it's all they understand!: are violent sentiments more criminogenic than attributing hostile intent in the escalation of grievances?</field><field name="creator">Kelty, Sally</field><field name="description">Is it what adult violent offenders think or how they think that discriminates them most from non-offenders? This study investigates whether violent and criminal sentiments, attributional biases and violence based grievance resolution strategies represent dynamic criminogenic risk factors. The results indicate that it is what offenders think that discriminates them more than how they think.
 
 The participants were 546 adults comprising 105 violent offenders, 238 university students and 203 men and women from a stratified random community sample. Using interview data from high-risk violent offenders, two scales were specifically developed to measure the variables of interest. The differences between offenders and non-offenders in violent attitudes was measured by expanding the scope of the Criminal Sentiments Scale. The differences in attributional biases and problem solving was assessed by a second scale developed for this study.
 
 The results showed that offenders were clearly different from non-offenders with the offenders endorsing significantly higher criminal and violent sentiments with an effect size of h2 =.46. The offenders also reported a significantly higher level of violence-based resolution strategies to end grievances than non-offenders. However, the surprising finding was that the adult male high-risk offenders did not demonstrate more pronounced hostile attributional biases than either adult men and women students or men and women from the community. The results imply that believing violence is acceptable and being prepared to use violence is more criminogenic than how you interpret the social behaviour of others. These findings have important implications for our understanding of why grievances escalate and the development of more effective intervention programs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/121/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocean views: an investigation into human-ocean relations</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Deborah Jane</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates some conceptions of oceans in modern Western societies that are highly influential in shaping human-ocean relations. My main aim in this dissertation is to demonstrate that the Western discourses of law, science and the aesthetic of the sublime illuminate characteristics of human-ocean relations in Western societies. I argue that the conceptions developed and perpetuated in the discourses of law, aesthetics and science unnecessarily constrain the possibilities for human-ocean relations and undermine just existences of oceans. A further aim of this dissertation is to set out an ethical political approach that is inclusive of a diversity of ocean views that facilitate improved knowledge about the oceans and transform dominant human ocean relations into more just relations.
 
 In approaching my critique of Western discourses of law, aesthetics and science I canvas a range of philosophical, social and political theories, but make most use of the insights of feminist and ecological feminist thinkers into forms of oppression and environmental justice. I also move beyond critique to set out an approach for structuring ocean policy debates and outcomes with a form of political epistemology that de-centres influential Western conceptions of oceans and is inclusive of a diversity of perspectives.
 
 In carrying out this dissertation's investigation I find that particular conceptions of oceans in the discourses of law, aesthetics and science narrowly define how Western human subjects think, feel and interact with oceans. These discourses provide a dominant position for Western subjects over those of other people and the oceans. This is how, in basic terms, I suggest that Western discourses undermine just existences for oceans. A common feature in the discourses that frame the conceptions of oceans that I discuss is the exclusion of a diversity of human-ocean relations from consideration. To counter the exclusionary practices of Western discourses I find that robust democratic processes are essential for just ocean existences. The importance of democratic processes is not only that they constitute ethical processes, and should be valued highly for that reason, but also because of a capacity to produce and deliver improved knowledge about the oceans and transform human-ocean relations. I advocate in particular the approach to political epistemology of Bruno Latour as one way to work toward just ocean existences. In the approach I advocate, oceans participate in democratic processes as agents, not as mere objects awaiting human benevolence or exploitation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/123/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The invisible empire: border protection on the electronic frontier</field><field name="creator">Kent, Michael Ian Anthony</field><field name="description">The first codes of the Internet made their tentative steps along the information highway in 1969, connecting two computers at UCLA. Since that time, the Internet has grown beyond institutions of research and scholarship. It is now a venue for commerce, popular culture and political discourse. The last decade, following the development of the World Wide Web, has seen access to the Internet, particularly in wealthy countries such as Australia, spread throughout the majority of the population. While this proliferation of users has created many opportunities, it also profiled questions of disadvantage. The development and continuation of a digital divide between the information 'haves' and 'have nots' was framed as a problem of 'access.' In the context of the increasing population online, debates into social inequity have been directed at technical barriers to access, the physical infrastructure and economic impediments to the adoption of the medium by all members of society. 
 
 This doctoral research probes questions of access with greater subtlety, arching beyond the spread of broadband or the expansion of computers into schools. Forging dialogues between Internet and Cultural Studies, new theories of the screen - as a barrier and border - emerge. It is an appropriate time for such a study. The (seemingly) ever expanding growth in Internet access is stalling. New approaches are required to not only understand the pattern of events, but the type and mode of intervention that is possible.
 
 This doctoral research takes theory, politics and policy to the next stage in the history of digital access. By forging interdisciplinary dialogues, the goal is to develop the concept of 'cultware'. This term, building on the history of hardware, software and wetware, demonstrates the imperative of understanding context in the framing and forging of exclusion and disempowerment. Mobilising the insights of postcolonial theory, Popular Cultural Studies, literacy theory and socio-legal studies, a new network of exclusions emerge that require a broader palette of interventionary strategies than can be solved through infrastructure or freeing codes. Commencing with the Universal Service Obligation, and probing the meaning of each term in this phrase and policy, there is a discussion of networks and 'gates' of the Digital Empire. Discussions then follow of citizenship, sovereignty, nationalism and the subaltern. By applying the insights of intellectual culture from the analogue age, there is not only an emphasis on the continuities between 'old' and 'new' media, but a confirmation of how a focus on 'the new' can mask the profound perpetuation of analogue injustices.  
 
 Access to the Invisible Empire occurs for each individual in a solitary fashion. Alone at the screen, each person is atomised at the point where they interface with the digital. This thesis dissects that point of access. The three components of access at the screen - hardware, software and wetware - intersect and dialogue. All three components form a matrix of access. However, the ability to attain hardware, software and wetware are distinct. An awareness of how and where to attain these literacies requires the activation of cultware, the context in which the three components manifest. Without such an intersection, access is not possible. The size of the overlap determines the scale of the gateway and the value of access. There is an interaction between each of these components that can alter both the value of the access obtained and the point at which the gateway becomes viable and stable for entry into the digital discourse. A highly proficient user with developed wetware is able to extract more value, capital and currency from hardware and software. They have expert knowledge in the use of this medium in contrast to a novice user. In dissecting the complexity of access, my original contribution to knowledge is developing this concept of cultware and confirming its value in explaining digital inequalities.
 
 This thesis diagnoses the nodes and structures of digital and analogue inequality. Critical and interpretative Internet Studies, inflected and informed by Cultural Studies approaches and theories, offers methods for intervention, providing contextual understanding of the manifestations of power and social justice in a digital environment. In enacting this project, familiar tropes and theories from Cultural Studies are deployed. Particular attention is placed on the insights of postcolonial theorists. The Invisible Empire, following the path of the digital intellectual, seeks to act as a translator between the digital subaltern and the digital citizen. Similarly, it seeks to apply pre-existing off screen theory and methodology to the Invisible Empire, illuminating how these theories can be reapplied to the digitised environment.
 
 Within this context, my research provides a significant and original contribution to knowledge in this field. The majority of analyses in critical and interpretative Internet Studies have centred on the United States and Europe. While correlations can be drawn from these studies, there are features unique to the Australian environment, both socially and culturally, as well as physical factors such as the geographic separation and sparse distribution of the population, that limit the ability to translate these previous findings into an Australian context. The writer, as a white Australian, is liminally positioned in the colonial equation: being a citizen of a (formerly) colonised nation with the relics of Empire littering the symbolic landscape, while also - through presence and language - perpetuating the colonization of the Indigenous peoples. This 'in-betweenness' adds discomfort, texture and movement to the research, which is a fundamentally appropriate state to understand the gentle confluences between the digital and analogue.
 
 In this context, the screen is the gateway to the Invisible Empire. However, unlike the analogue gate in the city wall that guards a physical core, these gates guard a non-corporeal Invisible Empire. Whereas barbarians could storm the gates of Rome without the literacy to understand the workings of the Empire within, when an army masses to physically strike at these gates, the only consequences are a broken monitor. Questions cannot be asked at the gate to an Invisible Empire. There is no common space in which the digital subaltern and the digital citizen cohabitate. There is no node at which translation can occur. These gates to the Invisible Empire are numerous. The walls cannot be breached and the gates are only open for the citizenry with the required literacy. This literacy in the codes of access is an absolute requirement to pass the gates of Invisible Empire. The digital citizen transverses these gates alone. It is a point where the off screen self interfaces the digital self. Social interaction occurs on either side of the screen, but not at the gateway itself.  
 
 Resistance within the borders of Invisible Empire is one of the founding ideologies of the Internet, tracing its origin back to the cyberpunk literature that predicted the rise of the network. However this was a resistance to authority, both on and off screen, by the highly literate on screen: the hacker and the cyber-jockey. This thesis addresses resistance to the Invisible Empire from outside its borders. Such an intervention is activated not through a Luddite rejection of technology, but by examining the conditions at the periphery of Empire, the impacts of digital colonisation, and how this potential exclusion can be overcome. Debates around digital literacy have been deliberately removed or bypassed to narrow the debate about the future of the digital environment to a focus on the material commodities necessary to gain access and the potential for more online consumers. Cultware has been neglected.
 
 The Invisible Empire, like its analogue predecessors, reaches across the borders of Nation States, as well as snaking invisibly through and between the analogue population, threatening and breaking down previous understandings of citizenship and sovereignty. It invokes new forms of core-periphery relations, a new type of digital colonialism. As the spread of Internet access tapers, and the borders of Empire close to those caught outside, the condition of the digital subaltern calls for outside intervention, the place of the intellectual to raise consciousness of these new colonial relations, both at the core and periphery.

One such group of policies concentrated on utilising the longstanding observation that congestion-free driving improves vehicular fuel economy. In particular, improving the average speed of urban traffic was believed to reduce urban fuel use. Strategies to create free-flowing traffic networks through traffic engineering and management techniques became an integral part of most transport energy conservation strategies. At the same time urban systems studies were appearing which suggested that urban land use factors are fundamental in determining transport energy demand. Some cities with denser, more centralised developnent patterns and congested traffic systems appeared to have lower per capita transport energy use than cities with low density, dispersed land use and free-flowing traffic networks. Conflicts thus began to be recognised between these land use studies and the traffic studies but they were never systematically examined. 
 
 This thesis focuses on explaining and attempting to resolve these apparent conflicts by drawing out the relative importance of freeflowing, fuel efficient traffic and broader land use/transport factors in determining urban system fuel efficiency. It does this by showing how a holistic understanding of transport energy use can be achieved by recognising the different levels of know1edge involved and by integrating research a t all these levels. Adopting this approach, a detailed examination is made of transport energy use in Perth, Western Australia. Spatial and temporal patterns of urban driving and vehicular fuel consumption are derived using a computer-instrumented vehicle within a framework of urban ecology. These patterns are described in detail and are found to be understandable in terms of a simple model of intersection and vehicle-based traffic events. Using this simple model, urban driving and fuel consumption patterns are then systematically linked back to their urban ecological framework. Centrality, as expressed by urban activity intensity emerges as the major underlying factor in both the urban ecological framework and driving patterns. Driving cycles for central to outer areas as well as the whole city are produced and a detailed examination is made of driving cycle development procedures, including the issue of data resolution. Two new methods of driving cycle synthesis are formulated. 
 
 Driving cycles together with travel survey and land use/transport model data are then used to estimate spatial differences in transport energy use per capita within the urban ecological framework. This case study is used to test two conceptual models of transport energy conservation implied by the traffic and land use studies: a linear assumptions model which suggests reductions in urban system fuel use through freer-flowing traffic and a feedback assumptions model which introduces some possible broader system effects of free-flowing and congested traffic. The results suggest very strong support for the feedback model and a reversal of the linear model. Urban structural factors such as distance from the CBD and density are found to be the major explanatory factors of Perth's transport energy use. The much higher vehicular fuel consumption in Perth's inner areas due to restricted traffic flows are completely offset by energy conserving land use and transport features which result in lower per capita energy use in these areas; the lower vehicular fuel consumption in uncongested outer areas is swamped by land use factors which result in longer travel distances and less use of energy conserving modes, resulting in markedly higher per capita energy use, i .e. a trade-off is found between a fuel efficient traffic system and a fuel efficient urban system. It is concluded that policies which propose fuel savings from blanket improvements in urban trraffic flow, such as major road building programmes will be counter-productive, while urban planning policies which encourage higher density, more compact cities will tend to lower energy use. It is suggested that a key area of research is now how to combine selective traffic system improvements with urban land use policies so that both may work in concert to produce a more fuel efficient urban system.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/125/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of beak and feather disease virus infection</field><field name="creator">Khalesi, Bahman</field><field name="description">The circovirus Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) causes psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) that is characterised by a chronic disease process associated with feather abnormalities, beak deformities and eventual death in various species of birds in the order Psittaciformes. This disease is seen in captive and wild psittacine species in Australia and several other countries and is a significant threat to the survival of some endangered psittacine species.
 
 This thesis reports on genetic studies that have furthered the understanding of the diversity of BFDV present within Australia. These studies have optimised methods of detecting BFDV. They have also resulted in the production of an immunogenic and antigenic recombinant BFDV Capsid protein that could lead to alternate methods of producing viral antigen for serological tests and the development of a BFDV vaccine.
 
 To assess the optimal method of the detection of BFDV infection, feather and blood samples were submitted by referring veterinarians throughout Australia from psittacine birds tentatively diagnosed with PBFD or with a history of being in contact with PBFD-affected birds. These samples were examined by 3 procedures commonly used to detect BFDV infection: a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and haemagglutination (HA) for the detection of virus, and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests for the detection of virus antibody in response to infection. Of the samples examined from 623 psittacine birds, the prevalence of BFDV DNA in feather samples detected by PCR was 18.85%. There was a strong correlation between PCR and HA testing of feather samples, although possible false-positive and false-negative PCR and HA results were obtained in some samples. Of the 143 birds that were PCR feather-positive only 2 had detectable HI antibody and these birds were also HA feather-negative, which suggests that they were developing immunity to recent infection. All birds with HI antibody were feather HA negative.
 
 Despite the rare occurrence of PBFD in cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus), 2 of the 13 samples collected from this species were PCR and HA positive indicating that this species can be infected with BFDV.
 
 Three studies were undertaken to further our understanding of the genetics of BFDV in Australian avifauna: sequence analysis of the BFDV detected in a grey cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), a species normally considered resistant to infection with BFDV; analysis of the genome of BFDV present in lorikeets (Trichoglossus sp.) in Australia; and analysis of the genome of BFDV detected in endangered swift parrots (Lathamus discolor). Sequence analysis of the entire genome of the cockatiel BFDV isolate revealed that it clustered phylogenetically with 2 other viruses, one from a sulphur crested cockatoo (SCC1-AUS) and one from a Major Mitchell cockatoo (MMC-AUS), which suggests that this isolate from the grey cockatiel was not a cockatiel-specific biotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF V1 of BFDV detected in 7 lorikeets demonstrated these 7 isolates clustered phylogenetically with other BFDV isolates obtained from Loriidae species elsewhere in the world and confirmed the presence of a loriid-specific genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data generated from ORF V1 of virus detected in 2 endangered swift parrots provided evidence they were also infected with BFDV genotypes derived from other species of birds, one isolate clustering with viruses from a Loriidae genotype and the other with isolates derived from species of Cacatuidae and Psittacidae.
 
 As part of this research, a baculovirus expression system was successfully developed for the production of recombinant BFDV Capsid protein. Inoculation of this protein into chickens resulted in the development of HI antibody, which demonstrated its immunogenicity. When used as an antigen in HI tests it detected antibody in virus-infected birds, which demonstrated its antigenicity. This protein offers potential application as an antigen for the development of serological tests and as an immunogen for incorporation into vaccines for control of PBFD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/126/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between breakfast, academic performance and vigilance in school aged children</field><field name="creator">Khan, Abdullah</field><field name="description">This research was designed to investigate the relationship between breakfast habits and academic performance and vigilance in upper primary children.  The content of breakfast consumed, the frequency of skipping breakfast, gender differences, social impacts and reasons for skipping breakfast in upper primary school children are also examined. There is little Australian research on children's breakfast habits or its relationship with academic performance and vigilance. Hence there is a need for research on this issue in the Australian context.
 
 The study involved 72 children of 5th, 6th and 7th grades from two schools in Western Australia. Data were obtained in three ways (a) the children completed a questionnaire which explored their breakfast habits, (b) the class teachers recorded the classroom performance/grades based on their classroom evaluations, and behaviour of the children based on the observations, and (c) the children were then given three vigilance tasks approximately one and a half hours into the school day. The children were divided into breakfast and no-breakfast groups based on the self-report of breakfast consumption on that day.
 
 The study found that more than half of the children at least sometimes skip their breakfast, with no differences attributed to gender. A number of children reported eating breakfast on the way to school but the proportion of those having a nutritious breakfast on the way to school was almost negligible. Even those having breakfast regularly (55%) might not be consuming a nutritious breakfast. Children reported feeling sleepy, inactive and forgetful as a consequence of skipping breakfast on the day. Reasons offered for skipping mainly had to do with personal choice and convenience, rather than with dieting and concern about body shape. There was no relationship found between breakfast skipping and academic performance and vigilance. Evidence that breakfast skipping affects concentration span of children was found for year 6 and 7 students in the study.
 
 Potential strategies based on the findings of this study are discussed. Providing a nutritious breakfast for children or supplementing their daily diets with fruit are interventions which have the potential to make a significant impact on children's health and well-being. In order to have a nutritious breakfast, children should be encouraged to have breakfast at home before leaving for school as they usually tend to eat a less nutritious breakfast on the way to school or at school. Organizing a breakfast day at school will also promote the importance of having breakfast. Further emphasis on nutrition and healthy eating in schools could make a difference.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/127/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional sustainability strategies: a regional focus for opportunities to improve sustainability in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Rachel</field><field name="description">The spatial implications of Global and Australian national trends in economy, society and environment are diverse. At a sub-national level these combine with local trends and issues to create unique regional milieu through which an integrated approach to sustainability may be negotiated. A change in government process may be required for sustainability to be implemented, and sub-national governance mechanisms are increasingly seen as important in enacting sustainability on the ground. Yet in Western Australia, large land mass and low population density means that neither State nor Local Governments are well equipped for this task. Western Australian regional policy and governance structures, as well as Commonwealth economic and regional policy trends, are important influences on regional sustainability. Both the Draft Western Australian State Sustainability Strategy and the Draft Statement of Regional Policy for Western Australia support a regional approach to sustainability planning. Yet models of regional governance organisation for the implementation of regional sustainability in Western Australia, such as regional associations of Local Governments, and Regional Development Commissions need to be further developed. It is at this regional level where partnerships between community, government and business may emerge to enact regionally appropriate initiatives for sustainability. For this to occur, community participation and government process that enables community participation to influence decision making is necessary. Regional approaches to natural resource management provide insight into the way that a regional approach to sustainability planning and organisation may evolve. Trends that influence regional issues and Commonwealth and Western Australian regional policy and structures provide a broad context for the development of regional sustainability strategies. Analysis of these issues and of the insights that may be gained from ideals for enabling governance mechanisms and regional natural resource management projects to facilitate regional sustainability are presented.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/128/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fuzzy knowledge map framework for knowledge representation</field><field name="creator">Khor, Sebastian Wankun</field><field name="description">Cognitive Maps (CMs) have shown promise as tools for modelling and simulation of knowledge in computers as representation of real objects, concepts, perceptions or events and their relations. This thesis examines the application of fuzzy theory to the expression of these relations, and investigates the development of a framework to better manage the operations of these relations.
 
 The Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) was introduced in 1986 but little progress has been made since. This is because of the difficulty of modifying or extending its reasoning mechanism from causality to relations other than causality, such as associative and deductive reasoning. The ability to express the complex relations between objects and concepts determines the usefulness of the maps. Structuring these concepts and relations in a model so that they can be consistently represented and quickly accessed and anipulated by a computer is the goal of knowledge representation. This forms the main motivation of this research.
 
 In this thesis, a novel framework is proposed whereby single-antecedent fuzzy rules can be applied to a directed graph, and reasoning ability is extended to include noncausality. The framework provides a hierarchical structure where a graph in a higher layer represents knowledge at a high level of abstraction, and graphs in a lower layer represent the knowledge in more detail. The framework allows a modular design of knowledge representation and facilitates the creation of a more complex structure for modelling and reasoning.
 
 The experiments conducted in this thesis show that the proposed framework is effective and useful for deriving inferences from input data, solving certain classification problems, and for prediction and decision-making.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/129/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the digital diva: women on the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Kilpin, Carrie</field><field name="description">In the year 2000, American researchers reported that women constituted 51 percent of Internet users. This was a significant discovery, as throughout the medium's history, women were outnumbered by men as both users and builders of sites. This thesis probes not only this historical moment of change, but how women are mobilising the World Wide Web in their work, leisure and lives. 
 
 Not considered in the '51% of American women now online' headline is the lack of women engaged in Web building rather than Web shopping. In technical fields relating to the Web, women are outnumbered and marginalized, being poorly represented in computer-related college and university courses, in careers in computer science and computer programming, and also in digital policy. This thesis identifies the causes for the low number of women in these spheres. I consider the social and cultural reasons for their exclusion and explore the discourses which operate to discourage women's participation. 
 
 My original contribution to knowledge is forged as much through how this thesis is written as by the words and footnotes that graze these pages. With strong attention to methodology in Web-based research, I gather a plurality of women's voices and experiences of under-confidence, humiliation and fear. Continuing the initiatives of Dale Spender's Nattering on the Net, I research women's use of the Web in placing a voice behind the statistics. I also offer strategies for digital intervention, without easy platitudes to the 'potential' for women in the knowledge economy or through Creative Industries strategies.
 
 The chapters of this thesis examine the contexts in which exclusionary attitudes are created and perpetuated. No technology is self-standing: we gain information about 'new' technologies from the old. I investigate representations and mediations of women's relationship to the Web in fields including the media, the workplace, fiction, the Creative Industries and educational institutions. For example, the media is complicit in causing women to doubt their technological capabilities. The images and ideologies of women in film, newspapers and magazines that present computer and Web usage are often discriminatory and derogatory. I also found in educational institutions that patriarchal attitudes privilege men, and discourage female students' interest in digital technologies. I interviewed high school and university students and found that the cultural values embedded within curricula discriminate against women. Limitations in Web-based learning were also discovered. 
 
 In discussing the cultural and social foundations for women's absence or under-confidence in technological fields, I engage with many theories from a prominent digital academic: Dale Spender. In her book Nattering on the Net: Women, Power and Cyberspace, Spender's outlook is admonitory. She believes that unless women acquire a level of technological capital equal to their male counterparts, women will continue to be marginalised as new political and social ideologies develop. She believes women's digital education must occur as soon as possible. While I welcome her arguments, I also found that Spender did not address the confluence between the analogue and the digital. She did not explore how the old media is shaping the new. While Spender's research focused on the Internet, I ponder her theses in the context of the World Wide Web. 
 
 In order to intervene in the patriarchal paradigm, to move women beyond digital shoppers and into builders of the digital world, I have created a website (included on CD-ROM) to accompany this thesis's arguments. It presents links to many sites on the Web to demonstrate how women are challenging the masculine inscriptions of digital technology. Although the website is created to interact directly with Chapter Three, its content is applicable to all parts of the thesis.
 
 This thesis is situated between cultural studies and internet studies. This interdisciplinary dialogue has proved beneficial, allowing socio-technical research to resonate with wider political applications. The importance of intervention - and the need for change - has guided my words. Throughout the research and writing process of this thesis, organisations have released reports claiming gender equity on the Web. My task is to capture the voice, views and fears of the women behind these statistics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/130/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the total tract apparent digestibility of nutrients from wheat for the weanling pig</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jae Cheol</field><field name="description">The objectives of the studies conducted in the Part A of this thesis were to quantify the variation of digestible energy (DE) content of wheat and to document the responsible factors for the variation. The general hypothesis tested in Part A of this thesis was that the variety, growing region, growing season, supplementation of xylanase and postharvest grain storage (i.e., six months of storage at ambient temperature) will influence the DE content of wheat when fed to weaner pigs.
 
 Experiment 1 (Chapter 3) examined the variation in the chemical composition of wheats as influenced by variety (Arrino, Westonia and Stiletto were selected), growing region (each wheat was selected from a high, medium and low rainfall region), season (1999 and 2000) and post harvest storage for 6 months. In this experiment, up to a 19% variation in the crude protein (CP) content (mean13.3, SD 2.59), up to a 5% variation in the starch content (mean 65.4, SD 3.56), and a 10-20% variation in the total (mean 9,2, SD 0.86), insoluble (mean 8.1, SD 0.84) and soluble (mean 1.1, SD 0.23) non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) contents were observed. The major experimental findings were:
 * Variety of wheat influenced the variation of most carbohydrate components, including fast digestible starch (FDS) (P&lt;0.001), acid detergent fibre (ADF) (P&lt;0.01), total and insoluble NSP (P&lt;0.05), and in vitro extract viscosity (P&lt;0.05);
 * The annual precipitation level in each region correlated to bushel weight (P&lt;0.01), protein (P&lt;0.01) and carbohydrate composition, including starch (P&lt;0.05), soluble NSP (P&lt;0.001), lignin (P&lt;0.001) and free sugars (P&lt;0.001), indicating the importance of the growing environment on the DE content of wheat;
 * Growing season influenced bushel weight (P&lt;0.001), CP (P&lt;0.01), amylose and amylopectin (components of starch, P&lt;0.05), ADF (P&lt;0.001), lignin (P&lt;0.001), soluble NSP (P&lt;0.001) and free sugars contents (P&lt;0.001), and the in vitro extract viscosity of wheat (P&lt;0.05);
 * Storage of wheat decreased ADF (P&lt;0.05), lignin (P&lt;0.01) and soluble NSP contents (P&lt;0.01) and increased the free sugar content (&lt;&lt;0.001).
 
 In Experiment 2 (Chapter 4), the effect of variety, growing region and growing season on the DE content of wheat in 5-week-old male weaner pigs was examined, and Summary III correlations between various chemical composition of wheat and DE content were established. The major findings were:
 * The DE content of wheats varied by up to 1.3 MJ/kg (12.5 13.8; mean = 13.3) in 1999 and by up to 1.8 MJ/kg (12.6 14.4; mean = 13.7) in 2000;
 * Both the variety and growing region significantly influenced (P&lt;0.05 - P&lt;0.001) the DE content of wheat;
 * Generally, the wheat variety Westonia and wheats grown in the low rainfall region contained a higher DE content than other wheats and growing regions;
 * In addition, growing season influenced (P&lt;0.001) DE content of wheat;
 * The mean DE content determined with weaner pigs in the current study was approximately 1 MJ/kg DM lower when compared to published estimates of the DE content of wheat determined with growing pigs;
 * Prediction of in vivo DE content of wheat for weaner pigs using NIRS (Near Infra- Red Spectroscopy) was not successful.
 * Significant inverse relationships between the DE content and xylose (P&lt;0.05), NDF (P&lt;0.01), total-P (P&lt;0.01) and phytate-P content (P&lt;0.05) of wheat were seen in 1999. However, such relationships were not significant in 2000, indicating a very strong seasonal influence on both chemical composition and DE content of wheat.
 
 Experiment 3 (Chapter 5) examined the effects of a supplemental enzyme (xylanase) and storage for 6 months on the DE content of wheats. In 1999, use of the enzyme tended to increase the DE content from 13.3 to 13.6 MJ/kg (P=0.065) whereas in 2000, use of the enzyme caused no change in DE content (13.7 to 13.6 MJ/kg). However, the response to enzyme addition was much greater in some wheats grown in some regions than others, suggesting that the DE response to xylanase supplementation was not systematic but appeared to be associated with the grain structure, with the DE content consequently arising from an interaction between variety and growing conditions of the wheat. For wheats harvested in 1999, storage improved the E content from 13.3 to 4.0 MJ/kg (P&lt;0.01), but for the 2000 wheats, storage for 6 months decreased DE content from 13.7 to 13.0 MJ/kg (P&lt;0.001). However, the 2000 data need to be interpreted with caution because some of the wheats were infested with weevils. 
 
 The DE response to supplemental xylanase in 1999 was negatively correlated to the total and insoluble arabinose to xylose ratio (P&lt;0.01), in vitro extract viscosity (P&lt;0.01) and lignin (P&lt;0.06), while FDS (P&lt;0.06) and phytate-P (P&lt;0.06) positively correlated to the DE response to xylanase. 
 
 The DE response to storage in 1999 was positively correlated to the NDF (P&lt;0.001) and xylose contents (P&lt;0.01) of the wheats, which had negative influences on the DE content of non-stored wheats. The addition of xylanase in stored wheat did not improve the DE content, suggesting changes in chemical composition (eg, activation of xndogenous xylanases) during storage.
 
 In Experiment 4 (Chapter 6), the same wheats were analysed or phosphorus (P) and hytate-P content, as the latter is considered to be anti-nutritive in pig diets. The total P and phytate-P content of all wheat samples ranged 2.6 (s.e. .64) g/kg and 1.8 (s.e. 0.13) /kg DM, respectively. Endogenous phytase activity was highly variable and averaged 63 (s.e. 29.6) FTU/kg between wheats. The variety, rowing region, season and storage of wheat did not influence the variation of P content. However, the precipitation level over two growing seasons was positively correlated to total-P (P&lt;0.05) and hytate-P contents (P&lt;0.05) of wheat. Phytate-P content of wheat can be predicted from total-P content (r=0.974, P&lt;0.001).
 
 In Part B, two experimental designs were generated based n the results of experiments described in Part A. From the previous experiment (Experiment 2, Chapter 4), it was evident that the structure of starch (i.e., amylose: mylopectin ratio) and phytate-P content of wheat were correlated to DE content of wheat. To reinforce the established correlations the following experiments were carried out, with the general hypothesis that the structure of starch (i.e., waxy vs. non-waxy wheat), particle size of ground wheat, and phytate-P content of wheat will influence the digestibility of nutrients (i.e., nitrogen, energy, minerals) in wheat-based weaner pig diets.
 
 In Experiment 5, the same variety (Janz) of a waxy (98% of total starch was amylopectin) isoline and a non-waxy  isoline (71% of total starch was amylopectin) wheat were ground through a hammermill fitted either with a 8.5 mm or 4.5 mm screen to achieve average particle sizes of 930 and 560 mcm, respectively. Diets were formulated and then fed to weaner pigs (3-5 weeks of age) with or without xylanase plus beta-glucancase. Digestibilities of starch, nitrogen, energy, and DE content of diets were measured at day 7 and day 21 to examine any age-related improvement of nutrient digestibilities during the first 3 weeks post-weaning. Waxy wheat improved total tract digestibility of starch (P&lt;0.05) and CP (P&lt;0.05), and the reduction of particle size improved total tract starch digestibility (P&lt;0.001) at both 7 and 21 days after weaning.
 
 However, energy digestibility and DE content of the diet were not influenced by either wheat type or particle size. Supplementation of xylanase plus ?-glucanase improved starch digestibility (P&lt;0.01) and DE content (P&lt;0.05) but not other nutrients, and this occurred especially in non-waxy (P=0.03) and larger particle-sized wheat (P=0.01).
 
 Pigs increased ability to digest protein with age (P&lt;0.05). However, the improvement in nutrient digestibilities in waxy and fine particle size wheat diets did not translate to improved pig performance.
 
 In Experiment 6, the hypothesis tested was that the digestibility and pig performance responses to supplemental xylanase, phytase and xylanase plus phytase would differ in weaner pigs according to P content of wheat. To test this hypothesis, two wheats containing high and low levels of total P (2.52g vs. 3.76 g total-P/kg DM) were obtained and fed to weaner pigs. Diets either had no enzyme or were supplemented with xylanase, phytase, or a combination of xylanase plus phytase. The hypothesis was partly supported in this experiment, since P and Ca digestibility were influenced by a wheat content by enzyme ineraction. Overall improvements in macronutrient digestibility and pig performance by supplementation of various enzymes were not significant. Daily growth (P&lt;0.05 - P&lt;0.01) and FCR (P&lt;0.05 - P&lt;0.01) were improved by the supplemental enzyme only in the first week of the feeding trial, mainly due to the increased P and Ca availability induced by the enzymes. Amounts of P and Ca digested were below the recommended requirements by NRC in the first two weeks of the feeding trial. Supplementation of phytase generally improved P and Ca digestibility (P&lt;0.05) in both low-P and high-P wheats. However, xylanase plus phytase supplementation did not produce synergistic effect for macronutrients, and mineral digestibilities, over single supplementation of xylanase or phytase.
 
 From the results obtained in this thesis I propose that: 
 1) The DE content of wheat for weaner pigs is variable due mainly to the change of chemical composition mediated by variety, growing environment and storage after harvest, and efficacy of supplemental xylanase is dependent on the chemical structure of NSP present in cell walls of wheat;
 2) Structure of starch, particle size, age after weaning, and P content of wheat are factors influencing nutrient digestibility in weaner pigs fed a wheat-based diet, and the efficacy of phytase on P and Ca digestibilities is dependent on the phytate-P content of wheat.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/131/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The phosphite responsive transcriptome of phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="creator">King, Michaela</field><field name="description">Phosphite has been used to effectively control the soil borne plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi in many horticultural crops, forest trees and natural ecosystems. However, the molecular mechanisms behind phosphite action on this pathogen are poorly understood.
 
 Several studies have shown that phosphite inhibits growth and zoospore production of P. cinnamomi and in addition induces significant physiological and metabolic changes in the mycelium. As an approach to understanding the mechanisms and relevance of these changes in the pathogen, the effect of phosphite on gene expression was investigated using microarray analysis. To construct the microarray, RNA was extracted from phosphite-treated (40 ug/ml) mycelium of P. cinnamomi isolate MP 80. The chosen phosphite concentration inhibited the mycelial growth by 70% but provided sufficient mycelium for RNA extractions after 4 days growth at 25C.
 
 The mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and cloned into lambda to construct a library consisting of 2 million pfu of which 80 % were recombinant phage. The inserts were sequenced for a random selection of clones from the library. The nucleotide sequences generated revealed a range of different P. cinnamomi genes being expressed and demonstrated that the cDNA library provided a good representation of the transcripts expressed in P. cinnamomi. The types of genes found to be expressed in the mycelium of P. cinnamomi included genes encoding GTP binding proteins involved in vesicle transport, structural proteins involved in maintaining cell membrane integrity,elicitors, phosphatases and ribosomal proteins.
 
 Over nine thousand cDNA transcripts were randomly selected from the cDNA library and prepared by PCR amplification and purification for microarray construction. Custom made cDNA arrays containing 9216 cDNA transcripts were constructed and probed with RNA from untreated mycelium and mycelium grown in medium with 40 ug/ml phosphite.
 
 Two genes, EF-1 alpha and cinnamomin gene, identified by qRT-PCR as being constitutively expressed were also positioned on the arrays as positive controls. In the process of identifying constitutively expressed genes, qRT PCR revealed that phosphite down-regulated a gene encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, a component of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway involved in the removal of abnormal and short lived-regulatory proteins and rate limiting enzymes.
 
 From the arrays a further seventy-two transcripts with altered patterns in gene expression (fold change &gt; 2) were identified. The majority of the cDNA transcripts spotted on the array were down-regulated with changes in gene expression ranging from 2- to 3.5-fold. Thirty-two cDNA transcripts were up-regulated with changes in gene expression ranging from 2- to 16-fold. Characterisation by sequencing revealed that the most highly induced transcripts coded for ADP-ribosylation factors, an ABC cassette transporter and a glycosyl transferase. A transcript encoding a vitamin B6 biosynthesis protein was also identified as up-regulated by 2.9-fold. In contrast, the down-regulated transcripts coded for cellulose synthase I, annexin, glutamine synthetase, metallothionein and an alternative oxidase. The results are discussed in terms of possible roles and mechanism(s) of phosphite action within the mycelium of P.cinnamomi.
 
 This work is the first comprehensive screen for phosphite regulated-gene expression in P. cinnamomi and represents a significant step towards an understanding of the mode of action of phosphite on this organism. This thesis provides valuable information on the molecular interaction between phosphite and P. cinnamomi, which in future studies may stimulate the discovery of novel methods and cellular targets for the control of plant pathogenic Oomycetes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/132/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting up close and textual: an interpretive study of feedback practice and social relations in doctoral supervision</field><field name="creator">Knowles, Sally Stewart</field><field name="description">The privatised interactions between doctoral student and supervisor as they jointly work on the text are the subject of my thesis. To investigate this important yet neglected aspect of supervision, I use data obtained from interviews with seven doctoral supervisory pairs in the social sciences, arts, and humanities in an Australian university. My methodology comprises a series of close-ups to explore feedback relations within supervision and the ways in which meanings are played out for both supervisors and students. The interpretive approach draws upon Foucaultian theory, critical discourse analysis, and (post)critical theory traditions. Accordingly, the power asymmetries between supervisor and student are seen as productive - in the sense of creatively fertile - and not merely synonymous with prohibition or disempowerment. Within five interpretive chapters, I engage with the productive and problematic aspects of supervisory relations, making visible how supervisory feedback assists in the formation of students' scholarly identities. My analysis examines how the pressures to ensure the production of timely and disciplined thesis texts are impacting on feedback relations. It also examines various ambiguities and tensions such as those embedded in the supervisor's position as 'pastor' and 'critic', between asymmetrical and relational power, between the promotion of authorship/autonomy on the one hand, and the preservation of the canon on the other. My discussion highlights the ways supervisors, notwithstanding their authority, attempt to mediate the power disparity through mechanisms such as standing back, withholding and filtering feedback, or using the invitational strategies of 'under offering' which downplay the disciplinary nature of their work. I also reflect on what makes acceptance or resistance more or less likely and what promotes/hinders the transition to and reliance on students' own expertise. Overall, the interpretations I offer suggest that the exercise of power is never straightforward, is opaque and ambiguous and susceptible to misunderstanding and unpredictability. My research thus reveals a picture of social relations that is less orderly and transparent than assumed in the institutional literature and associated guidelines. In particular, the research qualifies the current institutional faith that PhD research/writing is a transparent process, within which supervisors can be trained in the 'skills' for providing effective feedback so students can work at an efficient pace and produce predictable results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/133/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land use changes and the properties of stormwater entering a wetland on a sandy coastal plain in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Kobryn, Halina T.</field><field name="description">This study investigated the catchment of an urban wetland on sandy soils in Perth, Western Australia. The wetland is of high conservation value but is currently used as a stormwater-compensating basin. The three main aims of this work were to:
 1. determine the importance of stormwater drains in the water and pollutant balance of the lake;
 2. evaluate pollutant retention rates by the wetland; and
 3. identify current land uses in the catchment, determine their impacts on the wetland and identify tolerable levels of urbanisation for a wetland of this type.
 
 Stormwater flowing in and out of the lake subcatchments was monitored for two years for background flows and storm events. Water discharge, physical and chemical characteristics - including nutrients and heavy metals - were measured. Water and pollutant mass balances were determined. There was year-round flow at all sites, except from the smallest subcatchment. Flow characteristics differed between sites and were more influenced by catchment characteristics than rain intensity or duration.  More water entered than left the lake in spring. In autumn more water left the lake via the overflow than entered. 
 
 Due to poor maintenance, many drains overflowed during storm events. When compared to Australian and New Zealand  Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) water quality guidelines for receiving waters, only pH and conductivity met the recommended criteria. The nutrient and heavy metal loads varied with rainfall during both years of study. Suspended solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were proportional to rainfall, while concentrations of dissolved forms of nutrients were not. Background flows contributed significantly to the pollutant load. More than 85% of total suspended solids, nutrients and heavy metals were retained by the wetland - the only exceptions being copper and some forms of dissolved nutrients. An evaluation of the performance of the lake as a pollutant sink, using published data from constructed wetlands, identified phosphorus as the pollutant that requires the largest area for treatment.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/134/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reviving spirit in corporate systems</field><field name="creator">Krempl, Sandra</field><field name="description">The underlying context of this work is the mismatch between the systems that we need to comply with and what our spirit and intuition wants and needs. The thesis questions the relevance of spiritless corporate systems set up to serve the 'best interest' of human beings and other living things. Corporate systems have been established to comply with governing laws, to facilitate transaction of money and provide financial accountability to stakeholders and clients - spiritless matters. Corporate systems are ill equipped to protect our emotional and spiritual boundaries, our tangible and intangible links to the past and to the future. Spirit, which is the essence of life, is often not understood, discussed or included in the planning, development and implementation of the very systems that govern and impact on our lives and our communities. If spirit is included it is often well intended but rhetorical. Spirit needs to be revived and provided time, place and purpose, not only in our broader lives but also in our work cultures. Without spirit, facts have no meaning or relevance to life.
 
 This thesis searches for solutions to fill this spiritual gap in corporate systems, drawing on the experiences and lessons gained through engaging with communities and corporate systems in Australian and international contexts. The search covers a study of oral tradition(spirit),the impact of the lack of credibility afforded to oral tradition, developing and trialling common-ground terminology and frameworks befitting both corporate and spiritual systems across different industry sectors, the isolation of arts and culture from other sectors, the role of community development arts practices, and aspects of social science and urban development theories.
 
 The research traces the development and implementation of a cultural planning program for Western Australia through policy development at State government level and then framework development undertaken through Community Arts Network WA. The development of this cultural planning program draws on the contribution of diverse industry sector partners and this thesis research explains how their perspectives can contribute to the revival of spirit in corporate systems. The partnerships involved are business planning, town planning, community psychology, vocation, education and training, and sustainability.
 
 Having contributed to the development of the broader frameworks for the implementation of cultural planning across the State and beyond, this research delves further into addressing the issue of reviving spirit in corporate systems through refining the First (spirit) and Third Person (corporate) approach to cultural planning. This method is based on a key Spirit Catalyst called The First and Third Person Systems. This key Spirit Catalyst provides a guide for balance between spirit and corporate systems. There are a total of seven secondary Spirit Catalysts cited. Comparisons and contrasts between First and Third Person cultural planning process and strategic planning are provided. Principles and protocols and tools for evaluating spirit have been developed as part of the process. In keeping with the first person nature of spirit, personal narrative is used wherever possible to give life and meaning to facts and other planning and management processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/135/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing anaerobic degradation of lipids in wastewater by addition of co-substrate</field><field name="creator">Kuang, Yunhua</field><field name="description">Anaerobic treatment systems are becoming increasingly popular to treat complex organic wastes that contain carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. Lipids are widely found in sewage and industrial wastewaters. Dairy, edible oil, fat refining, slaughterhouse, wool scouring, meat processing plants and grease-trap wastes from restaurants generate wastewater high in lipids. Although it is well known that lipids can be degraded by biological process, they have been reported to inhibit anaerobic processes by causing sludge flotation and wash-out. The inhibitory effect of lipids in anaerobic process has also been attributed to the long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) which are the hydrolysed products of lipids. It has been shown that LCFA and lipids inhibit the formation of granular sludge in Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors and that the adsorption of LCFAs on to the granules can result in its flotation and washout. It was also found that the degradation of LCFA was very poor.
 
 Various techniques have been employed to enhance degradation of lipids and these include physico-chemical pre-treatment, application of two stage treatment employing new reactor designs like Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB). This thesis investigated the influence of co-substrates, both in the form of hydrolysed products and polymeric form, on reducing the toxicity and enhancing the degradation of LCFA and lipids in a single stage and two stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. The investigations were carried out on both microbiological and physico-chemical aspects. A combination of techniques including the use of light microscopy (LM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), transmission electron microscopy (SEM) and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) was used to study the characteristics of microbial aggregates and to locate microbial populations within these aggregates. The microbial populations visualised using FISH techniques were Bacteria, Archaea, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinaceae. The performance of digesters was also monitored by measuring bulk parameters such as concentration of residual substrates, intermediate products (LCFAs, volatile fatty acids), methane (or gas) production rate and chemical oxygen demand of treated effluent.
 
 Initially batch assays were carried out to determine the effects of glucose (hydrolysis product of carbohydrate) and cysteine (hydrolysis product of protein) on the toxicity of sodium oleate (hydrolysis product of lipid) to methanogenesis. The results showed that glucose and cysteine addition could reduce the toxicity of sodium oleate on the methanogenesis and enhance the degradation of sodium oleate. While the addition of glucose had a better effect than cysteine on decreasing the toxicity of sodium oleate, the combination of glucose and cysteine had the optimal result to stimulate the degradation of sodium oleate.
 
 Secondly the effect of addition of glucose, cysteine and sodium oleate as co-substrates on the characteristics of granules in an LCFA fed single stage UASB were investigated. It was shown that the addition of glucose produced the best results on the formation of granules while both cysteine and sodium oleate adversely affected the granule formation. In a LCFA inhibited digester glucose and cysteine addition enhanced the recoveries of different anaerobic microbial communities. Although the effects of glucose and cysteine on the various microbial groups were different, the combination of glucose and cysteine had the optimal results on recoveries of all bacterial groups.
 
 The next half of the thesis investigated the influence of starch and yeast extract on the hydrolysis and degradation of canola oil by application of one and two stage UASB reactors. The results showed that the combined addition of protein and carbohydrate had an optimal effect on enhancing the hydrolysis of lipid compared to the addition of only protein or carbohydrate by promoting a balanced growth of the microbial groups. It was also demonstrated that a two- stage UASB reactor performed better in terms of extent of lipid hydrolysis and methanogenesis than a one-stage UASB reactor.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/136/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental research on application of sub-surface flow constructed wetlands for meat processing industry effluent treatment and nutrient removal</field><field name="creator">Kurup, Rajendra</field><field name="description">Meat processing industries produce large volumes of high strength wastewater. Conventional technologies used in Australia and similar countries for treatment of effluent from meat processing and similar industries, such as wineries and processed food industry, are treatment ponds with or without a mechanical treatment system.
 
 A properly designed activated sludge treatment system would be capable of biological removal of phosphorus and nitrogen in addition to BOD5. These systems, however, require substantial electrical power, skilled operational support and produce large quantities of biosolids or sludge which require further on-site treatment or off site disposal. Application of sub-surface flow constructed wetland (SSF-CW) systems could provide a sustainable solution for treatment of meat processing industry effluent and other similar high strength wastewaters. There are, however, only very limited studies on application of SSF-CW for secondary treatment of high strength wastewaters. Although there have been a number of cases where SSF-CW have been used as the secondary treatment unit for municipal wastewater, this technology has not still become a common practice for the same purpose in Australia. Most of the applications are for either polishing of secondary or tertiary treated municipal wastewater or for greywater treatment.
 
 This research was funded by National Meat Industry Advisory Council (MINTRAC). Sustainable wastewater treatment has been taken up as a very important issue by meat industry. The industry provides Ph.D research scholarships through MINTRAC to develop new technologies for wastewater treatment and nutrient removal from meat processing effluent.
 
 The main objective of the research was to develop process engineering design parameters for sub-surface flow constructed wetland (SSF-CW) with Monto vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides recently reclassified as Chrysopogon zizanioides) as the emergent vegetation for treatment of high strength, nutrient rich wastewater. The study also investigated the phosphorus retention properties of pea gravel for use in SSF-CW system as bed media or as an external phosphorus removal system for meat processing industry effluent. In addition, chemical methods for phosphorus removal from meat processing industry effluent were also investigated.
 
 The thesis is based on experimental research. The research consisted of three types of experimental set up; a) using two laboratory experimental SSF-CW reactors (one with vetiver grass and the other reactor with no vegetation) in a greenhouse with batch feeding of artificial wastewater that simulates meat industry effluent, b) experiment with pea gravel of different particle sizes and solutions of different phosphorus (P) concentrations in a constant temperature room, c) laboratory experiment using actual meat processing industry effluent with alum and sodium aluminate for P removal.
 
 The structure of the thesis is as follows. Following the Introduction is the section of Literature Review, then sections on the experiments that follow a journal paper format, followed by a General Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations. A list of references is provided at the end of the thesis.
 
 The literature review section has four chapters (Chapter 2 to Chapter 5). Chapter 2 describes a review of meat processing industry effluent characteristics and current treatment technologies. Chapter 3 is a critical review of current literature on COD removal using sub-surface flow constructed wetlands (SSF-CW). Chapter 4 and 5 describe a review of various processes and models on the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus in SSF-CW system respectively.
 
 Chapters 6 to 10 deal with experimental research part of the thesis. Chapters, 6, 7 and 8 share a common methodology section which is described in Chapter 6. Results of the batch experiments with the laboratory SSF-CW systems on COD removal, nitrogen removal and phosphorus retention are discussed in Chapters 6, 7 and 8 respectively. Chapter 9 explains a detailed experimental study on phosphorus adsorption dynamics of pea gravel. Chapter 10 discusses the results on experiments using sodium aluminate and aluminium sulphate for P removal from meat processing industry effluent as an alternate P removal method for such effluent.
 
 An overview of the major results of the experimental section is discussed in chapter 11, in the General Discussion section. Conclusions and Recommendations of the research are provided in Chapter 12.
 
 In this study, it was observed that Monto vetiver grass performed better during nitrification than in denitrification, where the plant did not survive. Ammonium N removal followed a first order decay in both vegetated and un-vegetated experimental SSF-CW system with average removal ranging from 40 to 60 % of the influent. Denitrification was found to be the pathway for nitrate removal. As long as the carbon source was available, the denitrification followed a first order exponential decay, with over 80% of nitrate was removed in 48 hours. Vetiver grass sustained elevated ammonium levels of approximately 200 mg/L or more, however it was under stress during denitrification and it eventually died.
 
 The experimental SSF-CW systems with pea gravel as bed media could effectively retain soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the wetland cells during experiments of COD reduction and nitrification (with ammonia and high COD input). However, during denitrification study, both experimental SSF-CW cells did not show significant removal of SRP from wastewater. The vegetated cell removed nearly 50% of the input SRP, however, the un-vegetated cell did not show any trend for SRP removal, and in some cases the effluent SRP was nearly 90% of the input value.
 
 The role of Monto vetiver grass for N and P removal was found to be very minor and this study concluded that nutrient removal (N and P) by plant uptake could be neglected in the design of SSF-CW system with Monto vetiver grass.
 
 Adsorption is the major mechanism for P removal from the experimental SSF-CW systems, where pea gravel was used as bed media. The P adsorption capacity of pea gravel increased with decrease in particle size. For 16 to 18 mm, the Langmuir adsorption maximum was 99 mg/kg, whereas for very fine pea gravel powder (&gt;150 mcg) the maximum adsorption observed experimentally was 3950 mg/kg. In a typical wetland with pea gravel as bed media for meat processing industry, the media would be capable of P retention for about 2 to 3 years of operation. Supplementary chemical removal method is needed for sustainable P removal once the adsorption maximum of wetland cell is reached.
 
 A chemical P removal system using liquid alum and NaOH for pH stabilisation is more appropriate than sodium aluminate. Application of sodium aluminate for P removal for meat processing industry effluent is found to be less effective as it would need higher dosage, longer settling period, coloured supernatant, acid addition for pH adjustment. Liquid alum application rate is recommended to be between a molar ratio of Al: P of 3 for TP value of &lt;1 mg/L in the treated effluent.
 
 This research study concludes that horizontal flow SSF-CW system with Monto vetiver grass is suitable for COD removal and nitrification from high strength wastewater. Current design equation of horizontal flow SSF-CW system is mostly plug flow exponential decay method, but in this study, it has been concluded that retarded first order rate constant is the most appropriate design method for horizontal flow SSF-CW system for COD removal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/137/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A psychology of environmentally sustainable behaviour</field><field name="creator">Kurz, Timothy Robert</field><field name="description">Environmental sustainability has received increasing attention in both scientific and public life over the past 40 years. Almost all problems are the result of the behaviour of people. Hence, successful solutions to environmental problems must be social as well as technological. Psychology has offered a variety of theoretical approaches to understanding environmentally sustainable behaviour (ESB), including rationaleconomic, social dilemmas, attitude and behavioural models. A related psychological literature also exists regarding the ways in which ESBs may be promoted most effectively in the community.
 
 The early chapters of this thesis provide a critical review of the major theoretical approaches in psychology to understanding ESB, as well as the ways in which the psychological literature has conceptualised applied intervention programs to promote ESB. 
 
 It is suggested that a more holistic framework for conceptualising ESB is required which allows for the integration of the strengths of the variety of current approaches, and which also helps to understand their potential limitations. As such, a social-ecological framework is detailed that draws upon principles from both social and ecological psychology and has as its central tenet that ESBs should be conceptualised as the result of the ways in which members of a community interact with their environments. 
 
 In particular, it is argued that people's ESBs will be influenced by the extent to which they perceive particular environmentally relevant objects as 'affording' (Gibson, 1979) negative impact on the natural environment.
 
 Two field experiments were conducted (a pilot and a larger main study) which aimed to apply the social-ecological framework to the promotion of water and energy consumption within a local community in the city of Perth, Western Australia. 
 
 The results of both field experiments showed significant reductions in water consumption as a result of the installation around the home of labels that aimed to attune residents to the water consumption affordances of various appliances. The same effects were not, however, obtained from energy consumption labels. 
 
 In light of these differential effects upon water and energy consumption, a third, qualitative, study was conducted to examine the potential differences in residents' representations of these two resources and the ways in which residents constructed the use of these resources in their talk. A series of in-depth interviews was conducted with a sample of residents who had taken part in the main field experiment. These were analysed from the perspectives of social representations theory (Moscovici, 1984) and discursive psychology (Edwards and Potter, 1992; Potter and Wetherell, 1987). 
 
 This analysis revealed important differences in the ways in which these two resources were constructed. It also showed the ways in which community members were able to position themselves as responsible 'users', rather than 'wasters' of resources, the importance of justice and equity in residents' resources discourse, and the ways in which 'truth' in the environmental domain is constructed and ascribed to certain groups.
 
 The results of the field experiments and qualitative study together suggest that whilst attuning residents to the environmental impact affordances of relevant objects in their homes does affect their ESBs, this process can not be separated from the influence of the social environment in which these behaviours are embedded. It is also argued that such social environmental influences may be best understood in terms of the linguistic devices that members of a particular society have at their disposal to explain and legitimate their behaviour. 
 
 The major conclusion of the thesis is that attempts to investigate and promote environmentally sustainable behaviour should utilise multiple understandings from the social sciences, rather than remaining wedded to any one particular theoretical or methodological approach. The social-ecological framework that has guided the theoretical and practical work contained in this thesis represents an attempt at such integration. The implications of the findings for public policy efforts to promote ESB are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/138/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paul's paradigm for ministry in 2 Corinthians: Christ's death and resurrection</field><field name="creator">Ashley, Evelyn</field><field name="description">The Christian congregation in Corinth found Paul's weak presentation of the gospel and his approach to ministry to be scandalous. Recently arrived apostles reinforced and accentuated attitudes the congregation had already imbibed from contemporary Corinthian culture. As a result many in the congregation were less than satisfied with Paul's manner of speech, his apparent lack of charismatic qualities, his refusal to accept money from them, his lack of commendatory letters, and his lifestyle that was characterised by suffering, affliction, opposition and weakness.
 
 However, Paul's criteria for evaluating ministry, and by implication God's criteria, were significantly different from those of the Corinthian congregation. Key verses such as 2 Cor 1:9; 3:5; 4:7; 6:7; 12:9 and 13:4 indicate that Paul maintained that Christian life and ministry generally, and apostolic ministry in particular, must be carried out through divine power, not human power. His apostolic ministry was valid because it was exercised as God's representative, in God's presence (2:17), with God as judge (5:10) and as a result of God's mercy (4:1), not as a result of his own power, authority, eloquence or charismatic presence.
 
 The theological underpinning for Paul's approach to ministry is found in 13:4 where Christ who was crucified as a result of weakness, but lives as a result of God's power is the model for Paul who shares in his weakness, but in ministry to the Corinthians, also lives as a result of God's power. Paul's model for ministry was one of dependence on God. This is most clearly demonstrated in the affliction he experienced in Asia where he despaired of life itself, but in the process learned to rely on God who raises the dead. Thus his suffering, weakness and affliction, far from being disqualifiers for ministry, were in fact, demonstrations of his authenticity as a minister whose competency came from God and not from himself (3:6).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/139/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation, recombinant expression and immunogenicity of BHLP29.7, an outer membrane lipoprotein of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae</field><field name="creator">La, Tom</field><field name="description">Swine dysentery (SD) is an important endemic infection in many piggeries, and control can be problematic. In this study, the gene encoding a 29.7 kDa outer membrane lipoprotein of the causative intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, was identified and sequenced. An 816 bp hypothetical open reading frame (ORF) was identified, with a potential ribosome binding site, and putative -10 and -35 promoter regions upstream from the start of the ORF. The 29.7 kDa outer membrane lipoprotein was designated Bhlp29.7 and the encoding gene named bhlp29.7.
 
 The amino acid sequence of Bhlp29.7 included a 19 residue hydrophobic signal peptide, incorporating a potential signal peptidase cleavage site and membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site. In silico analysis of this protein together with lipidation studies further supported its probable outer membrane localisation. Comparison of the Bhlp29.7 sequence with public sequence databases showed that it had up to 40% similarity with the D-methionine substrate-binding outer membrane lipoprotein (MetQ) of a number of bacterial pathogens. The Bhlp29.7 gene was detected in all 48 strains of B. hyodysenteriae examined, and in Brachyspira innocens strain B256T, but not in 10 other strains of B. innocens or in 42 strains of other Brachyspira spp. The gene was sequenced from B. innocens strain B256T and from 11 strains of B. hyodysenteriae. The B. hyodysenteriae genes shared 97.9-100% nucleotide sequence identity and had 97.5-99.5% identity with the gene of B. innocens strain B256T. The Bhlp29.7 gene was subsequently cloned and expressed as a histidine fusion protein in an Escherichia coli expression system.
 
 An ELISA test using recombinant his-tagged Bhlp29.7 (His6-Bhlp29.7) as the detecting antigen was developed and evaluated. The threshold value of the test was chosen to provide a highly stringent assessment of the disease status of a herd. The sensitivity and specificity of the test was 100%. When the test was applied to sera from eight herds with suspected SD, four gave ELISA values indicating that the herds were diseased. The remaining four herds gave ELISA values below the threshold value. These results indicated that the Bhlp29.7-ELISA was useful as an indirect test for exposure of a herd to B. hyodysenteriae and may be a helpful complement to current methods of SD diagnosis.
 
 Recombinant His6-Bhlp29.7 was evaluated as a vaccine subunit for prevention of SD. The His6-Bhlp29.7 was shown to be immunogenic in mice following two intramuscular injections. Vaccination of mice with His6-Bhlp29.7 provided full protection after oral challenge with B. hyodysenteriae. In two experiments, intramuscular and oral vaccination of pigs with the His6-Bhlp29.7 resulted in a 50% reduction in incidence of SD compared to unvaccinated control pigs (P=0.047). This is the first subunit vaccine shown to provide pigs with protection from SD. Further work is needed to optimise delivery routes and adjuvants for commercial development of the vaccine.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/140/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine-based ecological education: marine discovery centres, millennium kids, environmental citizenship, and a vision for an eco-camp</field><field name="creator">La Mar, Brendan Paul</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to gain knowledge and understanding about Marine-Based Ecological Education and then apply this knowledge and understanding to form the vision of an Eco-Camp in Western Australia. This has been done in three stages.
 
 Part one is an account of my personal immersion in a grass roots not-for-profit environmental youth organization, Millennium Kids. The most valuable lessons that I learnt during this time came through the Environmental Citizenship program. Initially I was a participant, and then on three other occasions I was a facilitator for the program. It was through these programs that I began to understand the value of facilitating lessons learnt from robust healthy nature.
 
 Part two of my research is concerned with marine education centres and uncovering their stories; documenting their ethos, education and public relations. I aim to focus on what each centre does best and how this has enabled them to become the entity that they are today. Through this process I collect information that will inform the culminating vision of this thesis, the Eco-camp.
 
 Part three is the vision for an Eco-Camp, which has developed organically from my understandings derived from parts one and two. Through both my research on marine education centres and my personal immersion in Millennium Kids Environmental Citizenship program, I began to realize the value and need for an Eco-Camp. The Eco-Camp will be in remote robust healthy nature and will immerse participants in these environments, attuning them to the rhythm of Gaia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/141/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of need accounting for (dis)advantage: public housing co-operatives in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Lacroix, Carol</field><field name="description">Concerns about the nature of poverty and how to achieve equitable resource distribution are rife in Australia where, as elsewhere, welfare resources are becoming increasingly scarce. At the heart of these concerns are questions about access: in particular, how to ensure that the least affluent are able to access the resources they require. At the same time, there is a growing sense that cultural as well as social factors are central to patterns of unequal distribution, especially in a neo-liberal context where there is a deregulation of social and economic structures, and a shift to consumption or lifestyle capitalism.
 
 This thesis employs Bourdieu's theoretical framework of capitals to examine the nature of affluence (and therefore poverty) in Australia, the processes that facilitate access to material resources by the affluent rather than the poor and, ultimately, the notion of need that underpins questions of choice, access and resource allocation. Drawing on interviews with members of publicly funded housing co-operatives in WA, an example of welfare housing that simultaneously represents an example of a deregulated symbolic economy and an expression of the contemporary lifestyle movement, I highlight key resources and interests that distinguish these individuals as affluent, as well as some of the cultural and social processes that enable them to convert their resources into the subsidised housing. Based on this analysis, I then interrogate the frameworks for understanding poverty that regulate the distribution of welfare resources, and argue that these were central to the ability of the more affluent to secure publicly funded housing resources. In particular, I examine the new multidimensional frameworks for understanding poverty in terms of their ability to recognise key resources and processes.
 
 I argue that Bourdieu's framework - as a resource based framework that accounts for cultural as well as social and economic factors in the (re)production of advantage and disadvantage - represents a worthwhile inclusion into theories and policies that are concerned with accounting for poverty and ensuring that residual welfare aims are met.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/142/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex allocation and reproductive costs in a gull with a long breeding season</field><field name="creator">Lamont, Christine</field><field name="description">The Silver Gull is a small gull (265 - 450g), which exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males larger than females. It has a protracted laying period of about 8 months over the winter on Penguin Island in Western Australia. The Silver Gull was studied on Penguin Island from 2000 to 2002. Completed clutches were removed from breeding pairs to induce repeat laying in order to determine the effect of increased reproductive effort on maternal body condition, egg production ability, offspring sex ratio and chick rearing capacity.
 
 Increased egg production had no significant effect on maternal body condition as measured by condition index, derived from mass divided by a measure of skeletal size. The seasonal period, divided into thirty-day intervals, had a significant impact on female condition index, with a decline in condition toward the end of the breeding season. While male condition also appeared to decline at the end of the season, this pattern was not significant.
 
 The initiation of laying varied between the three years of the study. The earliest occurred in 2000, which also experienced earlier rainfall than the later two years. Egg size and mass decreased throughout the breeding season although the number of eggs in a clutch did not decline. The size and mass of the eggs was significantly affected by the laying history of the parents, although this effect was dependent on the year in which the eggs were produced. 
 
 The minimum interval required by Silver Gulls to replace a lost clutch is about 14 days. This interval increased from the start of the breeding season, but then declined toward the end, as summer was approaching. Laying interval increased significantly as the number of clutches produced by the parents also increased, up to 4 clutches in total. As more clutches were produced past this point, the laying interval became shorter. 
 
 The probability of a replacement clutch being produced after clutch removal, declined as the clutch number increased and as the season progressed. Individuals that laid clutches with a larger mean mass were more likely to lay a replacement clutch. Increasing reproductive output caused a decline in the proportion of clutches that were replaced after clutch removal. The proportion of clutches that were replaced also varied between the years with the highest rates of replacement seen in 2000 which was also the year that experienced the earliest start in laying. The size of the original clutch in terms of its mean mass and volume was related to the size of the replacement clutch, but this relationship varied according to the timing of laying. 
 
 During 2000 and 2001 male offspring predominated in the first two clutches produced by Silver Gulls. Further clutches that were produced demonstrated a sex ratio skewed toward females, the smaller sex in this species. Offspring sex ratio was close to equality in 2002 with very little effect caused by increased egg production. There was no effect of year, season or the laying history of the parents on hatching success. Growth rate in chicks was influenced by the year in which the chick hatched, the period during the season in which the chicks hatched, its sex and the laying history of the parents. The relationship between chick growth and the laying history, however, was complex with no consistent pattern emerging in terms of the performance of chicks from each treatment group. While the chicks from control groups generally grew faster than the chicks from manipulated parents, those individuals that were laid or raised by manipulated parents that had laid at least three clutches in total also performed well. 
 
 Using the two main measures of reproductive success in the current study, egg production and chick rearing, those birds that were induced to lay multiple replacement clutches, were able to maintain a high level of condition and reproductive success. It is proposed that in the Silver Gull, only those individuals with a high level of condition continue to lay replacement clutches. If the female is unable to produce well provisioned eggs with a high chance of success, the breeding attempt is abandoned. Despite no loss of condition detected in female Silver Gulls with increasing clutch number, there was a significant shift in the offspring sex ratio toward females, indicating that strategies were in place to cope with the increased reproductive effort incurred as a consequence of repeat laying. Protracted laying in this species allows replacement of lost clutches only after maternal condition has been regained after laying.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/143/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The availability of international judicial review of government breaches of human rights</field><field name="creator">Laoh, Arnold</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to provide description, analysis and criticism on the existing international instruments for the promotion of respect and protection of human rights, as well as a suggestion to the international community through the United Nations mechanism to adopt an additional legal instrument as a complementary procedure. This, in turn, should serve as an extra-pressure upon the State governments to bring their internal legal system in the same line as the international standards for the protection of human rights.
 
 It is being argued in this work that the current international procedures available to individual alleging their human rights have been abused by State are no longer sufficient and therefore another procedure should be introduced and put into place. The chapter The Case of Indonesia serves as a good (or bad?) example of State abusive conduct and remain untouchable under international mechanisms. Despite gross and systematic violations of human rights Indonesian government is still immune due to executive-heavy legislation system, restricted judicial review as a result of a corrupt judiciary and impunity of government and other public agencies.
 
 The study fvstly concentrates on the procedures available at international level for dealing with individual complaint alleging human rights violations. Different procedures both under Charter and treaty provisions are analysed in the attempt to describe their advantages and disadvantages. Two Charter-based procedures dealt with in the discussion cover the communication procedure under the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) which includes the 1503 procedure. Treaty-based procedures are given special attention in this thesis which include the procedure before the Human Rights Committee (HRC), the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the Committee against Torture (CAT) and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).
 
 The discussion further presents a critical appraisal of those procedures in which the limitations and weaknesses of the procedures are analysed followed by the suggestion to adopt an additional procedure to complement the current mechanisms available to individual seeking remedies for human rights violations. The limitations of the procedures featured largely by the fact that the decisions resulted from those procedures are legally non-binding. And this all what an individual can receive after being allowed to bring hisher petition before the Committee. Before one is permitted to communicate with one of the Committee hetshe must first meet all the conditions of admissibility. The condition exhaustion of all domestic remedies can virtually be seen as a hindrance for individual to communicate with the Committee. In order to support this argument several decisions on several individual complaints handed down by the HRC are presented in this study.
 
 Finally, the study introduces a complementary procedure called International Judicial Review by which the State Constitutions and legislation can be examined whether or not they are in conformity with international human rights standards and norms. If found inconsistent the Constitutions or legislation must be declared invalid. The power to review is given to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as the principal judicial organ of The United Nations. And as a World Court the decision made by the ICJ has legally binding power.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/144/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiences of schooling of students with former Yugoslav ethnic background in a Western Australian secondary school</field><field name="creator">Lasic, Tomaz</field><field name="description">Ethnicity is an important social construct mobilised in the discourses of multicultural education. At present, little research exists on the way ethnicity impacts on the schooling experiences of students with former Yugoslav background (SFYB) in Australia.
 
 This qualitative study looks at the daily realities of twelve SFYB at a Western Australian government secondary school. Particular attention is paid to the management of their ethnic identities to achieve their educational, social and other goals.
 
 Data gathered from the twelve in-depth, guided interviews with SFYB is analysed through the lens of critical multiculturalism, posited as one of several notions of multiculturalism and one with a specific social justice agenda. Theories of hybridity developed by Homi Bhabha and Stuart Hall are translated into the critical multiculturalist framework and provide a further development of the analysis of the data in which hybridity is seen as both experiences and enactments.
 
 The study findings suggest that these SFYB embody the principles of critical multiculturalism as skilful managers of contingencies of ethnic identities, aspirations and challenges they encounter at the school. The study also proposes that the notion of critical, power conscious hybridity could be useful as a conceptual tool in the future work of critical multiculturalists.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/145/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caryl Churchill: representational negotiations and provisional truths</field><field name="creator">Lavell, Iris</field><field name="description">JUDGE: Go away Barbara.

 Although English playwright Caryl Churchill wrote the three scripts examined in this thesis more than thirty years ago, each captures our contemporary zeitgeist in sometimes surprising ways. These works explore the shifting politics of power, revealing binary and essentialist representations that not only continue but have been strengthened on all sides in recent years, suggesting their central importance in defining and controlling culture. 
 
 This thesis examines how Churchill subverts conventional forms of representation and probes the ways in which she herself has been represented by critics and scholars at various periods of her writing career. It is my contention that these processes operate in tandem, performing an ongoing dialogue.  Because of the dynamic nature of this dialogue, the aim here is not so much to provide an increasingly unified or finite understanding of the artistic milieu from which a play emerges, as it is to recognize the level of complexity underlying the mutable and political process of its interpretation. 
 
 I have undertaken a detailed exploration of three lesser-known short scripts from 1972, a 'watershed' year for Churchill, culminating in the relative success of Owners, her first major stage play. While many of her earlier works have been deserving of further exploration, a number of them have been largely overlooked in the broader environment of her subsequent contribution to contemporary theatre.  The particular scripts that I explore in the course of this thesis are: The Hospital at the Time of the Revolution; Schreber's Nervous Illness and The Judge's Wife, an unperformed stage play, a radio play and a television play respectively. These works are worthy of exploration because of their experiments with the politics of subjectivity as it impacts on race, gender and social class, and notions of 'legitimacy' that shift with a person's changing circumstances. Each of these plays implicitly demonstrates the importance of subjectivity in relation to representational power as it places characters who have traditionally been silenced at the centre of the action. 
 
 I have titled my thesis Caryl Churchill: Representational Negotiations and Provisional Truths. In invoking this title I pre-empt the engagement of a subjective, strategic essentialist approach, both in critiquing this period of Churchill's work and in declaring the assumptions of the arguments contained in the pages that follow.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/146/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemistry of the leaching of chalcopyrite</field><field name="creator">Lazaro-Baez, Maria Isabel</field><field name="description">The potential region in which chalcopyrite dissolves during the oxidative leaching of the mineral in ferric sulphate solutions has been established.

The ring-disk experiments are generally consistent with thiosulphate as this species. The effect of potential and various ratios of ferric to ferrous ions on the rate has been investigated by both electrochemical and chemical analysis techniques. The role of non-oxidative dissolution in the leaching of chalcopyrite has been explored and it has been shown that the initial rate of non-oxidative dissolution is significant and could exceed the oxidative rate at long leach times.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/147/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Syndicated loans in the United States (1995-2000): announcement effects, long-term performance and capital structure issues from a borrower perspective</field><field name="creator">Le, Kim-Song</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of announcements of syndicated loans on the share prices of borrowing firms.  I use a sample of 5,465 loan observations reported in the International Financing Review Platinum database to study this impact. Event study methodology is used. My overall results show significantly positive wealth effects on the borrowing firms. However, when I partition my data set into revolving credit agreements, term loans and hybrid loans, I find that the results are driven primarily by revolving credit agreements.  I also observe that the size of the event window plays an important role in identifying the wealth effects for the borrowers.  A five-day event window (-2, +2) shows share price response to revolving credit announcements to be significantly positive.  A three-day event window (-1, +1) reveals that announcements are statistically positive for revolving credit agreements and statistically negative for term loan announcements.  My results are consistent with previous studies in this area. I also distinguish between financial press announcements and information provider (IFR) announcements to cater for the potential for reporting bias.  I find that both the IFR and financial press announcements are significant for the five-day window, but only the financial press results are significant for the three-day window.  My study is unique in that I differentiate the impact of different sources of information on the market reaction to borrower share price.
 
 In addition to the examination of the wealth effect, I also use the structure of the loans to examine the uniqueness of bank loans and their ability to provide financial slack.  Specifically, I examine whether revolving credit loans or term loans or hybrid loans make bank loans unique and their ability to provide financial slack. I observe that out of the three structures of bank loan, only revolving credit loans allow the borrower to more precisely match the funds acquired with the firm's investment needs and to market time by borrowing at times when financing costs are attractive. Revolving credit loans are positively valued by the market both initially and over the longer term. Bank loans reduce information asymmetry, but the renegotiation characteristics of revolving credit loans allow borrowers to exploit changes in the interest rate environment, thus providing support for the market timing theory of capital structure.  In contrast to puzzling results of previous studies, I present evidence of long-term positive performance following bank loans.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/148/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and geography: literacy pedagogy and curriculum politics</field><field name="creator">Lee, Alison</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into processes of gendered subject production in literate practices in school settings. Focusing on student writing in geography, the study explores gender differences in written texts with a view to asking what is differently at stake for girls and for boys in 'becoming literate' in school geography.
 
 The study is an ethnographic case study of a geography classroom, focusing in particular on contexts for the production of two texts which are subject to close textual analysis. Drawing on a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives: curriculum studies, linguistics and feminist theory, the thesis argue that classrooms are sites of multiple and competing discourses. Student texts are oriented discursively and generically in different ways. These orientations both reflect and produce wider discursive alignments within the discipline of geography and elsewhere. The thesis investigates the politics of these differences.
 
 Part I builds a detailed account of the Year 11 geography classroom as a set of curriculum contexts within which students' literate practices are located. Readings are produced of the official curriculum resources, focusing in particular on the syllabus and the classroom textbook material. The spoken language dynamics of the classroom are investigated in terms of the materiality of processes of speaker positioning along gender lines in the production and negotiation of geographical meanings.
 
 Part II produces detailed readings of two student essays: one by a girl, one by a boy. Differences between the two are investigated, drawing links between the texts and the discursive contexts of their production and reception. The argument is made that the two texts enact a significant gender difference in and through different geographies.
 
 Part III discusses the consequences of the thesis findings for contemporary debates about literacy pedagogy. This includes a critique of one dominant framework within which the notion of 'critical literacy' is being engaged: that of educational linguistics. Finally, the argument is made that existing accounts of 'subject-specific literacy' need to be expanded to engage two senses of the word 'subject': both the specificity and multiplicity of the discourses of subject-disciplines and the concomitant production of different human subject positions through textual practice. To investigate the implications of this, theories of literacy pedagogy, it is argued, need to engage more substantially with available theories of the subject, such as feminist theories, while at the same time engaging sophisticated analytics for the exposure of the material workings of discursive practices in school-literate productions.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/149/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifespan development: a social-cultural perspective</field><field name="creator">Ashman, Ori</field><field name="description">This thesis explores some of the social factors that may affect individuals as they age. A lifespan developmental perspective is employed in investigating the effects of societal aging stereotypes on will-to-live and risk-taking skills. Results suggest negative aging stereotypes may have deleterious effects on the elderly, but not young individuals in terms of will-to-live, but have no effect on risk-taking abilities. Furthermore, a cross-cultural analysis of Americans and Japanese reveals robust differences in self-concept between countries, which in turn partially mediate the effects of culture and age on control strategies. It appears culture and age may play important roles in determining individuals' self-concept, motivation, and regulation of behavior.
 
 The first part of Study 1 examined whether stereotypes of aging contribute to decisions the elderly make about when to die. Elderly and young participants (n = 64) were subliminally primed with either negative or positive stereotypes of old age using a computer, and then responded to hypothetical medical situations involving potentially fatal illnesses. Consistent with my prediction, the aged participants primed with negative stereotypes tended to refuse life-prolonging interventions, whereas those primed with positive age stereotypes tended to accept the interventions. This priming effect did not emerge among the young participants for whom the stereotypes were less relevant. The results suggest that socially transmitted negative stereotypes of aging can weaken elderly will-to-live, or at the very least, willingness to pursue medical intervention.
 
 The second part of Study 1 examined whether the older adults demonstrate similar risk-taking skills to the younger adults, and whether this ability is preserved, even after exposure to age stereotypes. Sixteen young and 16 older participants were tested on a risk-taking decision task following exposure to subliminal aging stereotypes. In all conditions, both the old and young participants systematically and equivalently increased their willingness to take risks as risk level decreased. Furthermore, response times were an inverted U shape curve with slower response times recorded at the medium risk level and faster times as risk levels shifted up or down. The findings suggest the ability to make decisions based on risk level is maintained into old age.
 
 Study 2 investigated results reported by a number of studies finding that primary control remains stable in old age, is lower in Asian countries, and that secondary control increases in old age and is higher in Asian countries. I examined whether these patterns may be due to the mediating influence of an interdependent self-concept. In a sample of 557 young and older adults in Japan and the United States, primary and secondary control, age, and interdependence were studied. I found that interdependence partially mediated the influence of culture on secondary control and interdependence partially mediated the influence of age on both primary and secondary control. Findings suggest that interdependence is an important factor that should be considered in trying to understand the determinants of control crossculturally and developmentally.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/150/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the pink: (post) youth iconography in cinema</field><field name="creator">Lee, Christina</field><field name="description">Beyond the Pink: (Post) Youth Iconography in Cinema is a project in cultural time travel.  It cuts up linear cinematic narratives to develop a hop-scotched history of youth, Generation X and (post) youth culture.  I focus upon the pleasures, pedagogies and (un)popular politics of a filmic genre that continues to be dismissed as unworthy of intellectual debate.  Accelerated culture and the discourse of celebrity have blurred the crisp divisions between fine art and crude commodity, the meaningful and meaningless, and real and fictive, unsettling the binary logic that assigns importance to certain texts and not others.  This research project prises open that awkward space between representation and experience.
 
 Analysts require methods and structures through which to manage historical change and textual movement.  Through cinema, macro-politics of identity emerge from the micro-politics of the narrative.  Prom politics and mallrat musings become imbued with social significance that speak in the literacies available to youth.  It grants the ephemerality and liminality of an experience a tactile trace.  I select moments of experience for Generation X youth and specific icons - Happy Harry Hardon, Molly Ringwald, the Spice Girls, the Bitch, the invisible raver, teen time travellers Marty McFly and Donnie Darko, and the slacker - to reveal the archetypes and ideologies that punctuate the cinematic landscape.  The tracked figures do not configure a smooth historical arc.  It is in the rifts and conflicts of diverse narratives and subjectivities where attention is focused.  
 
 This research imperative necessitates the presentation of a series of essays arranged in a tripartite framework.  The first section proposes theoretical paradigms for a tethered analysis of filmic texts and Generation X.  The second segment explores sites of struggle in public spaces and time.  The final section leaves the landscape of post-Generation X to forge the relationship between history, power and youth identity.  I particularly focus on the iconography, ideologies and imaginings of young women to lead the discussion of the shifts in the experience and representations of youth.  By reinserting women into studies of film, it is imperative to stress that this is not a dissertation in, and of, women's cinema.  Rather, it serves as an historical corrective to the filmic database.  
 
 The existing literature on youth cinema is disappointing and narrow in its trajectories.  Timothy Shary's Generation Multiplex: The Image of Youth in Contemporary American Cinema and Jon Lewis' The Road to Romance and Ruin: Teen Films and Youth Culture exemplify the difficulties of capturing the complexities of individual films when they are collated in artificial and stifling categories.  At one end of the analytical spectrum is the critique that comes with the caveat of 'it's just another teen movie'.  Jonathon Bernstein's monograph Pretty in Pink: The Golden Age of Teenage Movies is one such example which derails into acerbic diatribes and intellectual dismissal.  The Cinema of Generation X: A Critical Study by Peter Hanson is a more successful project that is interested in the influences that inform a community of filmmakers than arriving at a catalogue of generic themes and narratives.  There is an emphasis on the synergy between text, producer and readership.
 
 I continue this relationship explored by Hanson, but further accent the politics of film.  The original contribution to knowledge offered by this doctoral thesis is a detailed study of (post) youth popular culture, building into a model for Generation X cinema, activating the interdisciplinary perspectives from film and cultural studies.  With its adaptability into diverse media forms, cultural studies paradigms allow navigation through the expansive landscape of popular culture.  It traverses beyond simple textual analyses to consider a text's cultural currency.  As an important carrier of meaning and sensory memories, cinema allows for alternative accounts that are denied in authorised history.  As a unique form with its own visual literacy, screen theory is needed to refine observations.  This unique melding of screen and cultural studies underscores the convergent relationship between text, readership, production and politics.
 
 This doctoral thesis activates concepts and methods of generationalism, nationalism, social history and cultural practice.  There is a dialogue between the chapters that crosses over text and time.  The 1980s of Molly Ringwald shadows the dystopia of Donnie Darko.  The celebrity status of the Spice Girls clashes with the frustrated invisibility of the female raver.  Douglas Coupland's vision of Generation X in 1991 has evolved into Richard Linklater's documentation of post-youth in the new millenium.  Leaping between decades through time travel in cinema, I argue that the nostalgic past and projections for the future evoke the preoccupations and anxieties of the present.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/151/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficacy and mechanisms of action of EMDR as a treatment for PTSD</field><field name="creator">Lee, Christopher</field><field name="description">The first aim of this thesis was to describe the characteristics of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and to elucidate its place as a symptom disorder that sometimes develops when people are exposed to a traumatic event.  The current major theoretical approaches to account for why some people who are exposed to trauma develop PTSD and the mechanisms by which this occurs were described.  Three classes of theories were reviewed: conditioning/learning approach; information processing theories with a particular focus on the meaning of the trauma event; and biological models with an emphasis on recent neurocircuitry and neurochemistry models.  
 
 Successful treatment approaches were then reviewed which indicated two major contenders for the most efficacious treatment for PTSD:  traditional cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) using either stress inoculation or prolonged exposure; and eye movement desensitisation and processing (EMDR).  Prior to the first study (Lee, Gavriel, Drummond, Richards, and Greenwald, 2002), a review of the literature indicated equivalent effects for EMDR and CBT.  There had been very few direct comparison studies and each had serious methodological flaws, particularly with respect to random assignment and treatment fidelity. Therefore, the first study ensured adequate attention to these areas and involved a direct comparison between the two procedures using a sample of 24 participants diagnosed with PTSD. EMDR and stress inoculation training with prolonged exposure were found to lead to similar symptom improvement at the end of treatment, apart from a slight advantage for EMDR on intrusion symptoms. Both treatments led to significantly greater symptom reduction than a wait list control condition.   At follow-up, EMDR led to greater gains on both self-report and observer rated measures of PTSD and self-report measures of depression.   Overall, the findings were similar to those described in previously published studies, with a suggestion that EMDR was slightly more efficient than the standard CBT approach.  
 
 Given that the evidence suggested that EMDR was a more efficient treatment, it became critical to understand the underlying processes.  A process study was undertaken that examined the responses of people with PTSD receiving EMDR treatment (Lee, Taylor, and Drummond, 2006). Guided by process studies of other treatments and theories that might account for why EMDR is effective, participants' responses were examined to see which models better accounted for symptom improvement.  The main analysis tested whether or not the responses were consistent with processes that occurred during traditional CBT treatment, which prior research had identified as reliving, or whether they were more consistent with Shapiro's proposal that enhanced information processing occurs because there is a dual focus of attention (that is, the person simultaneously focuses on an external stimulus and on the traumatic memory) (Shapiro, 1995).  The responses made by 44 participants were coded by an independent rater according to whether they were primarily reliving, distancing, affect or material other than the primary trauma.  The coding system was found to have satisfactory inter-rater reliability.  Greatest improvement occurred when the participant processed in a more detached or distant manner, whereas reliving responses were not associated with improvement.  Cross-lagged panel correlations suggested that processing in a more detached manner was a consequence of the EMDR procedure rather than a measure that co-varied with improvement.  The findings underscored a difference in the processes that underlie EMDR and traditional CBT.
 
 The major question left unanswered from this second study was what causes this distancing process?   Competing views were that it was facilitated by eye movement; alternatively, the therapist's instructions to participants might have precipitated this distancing phenomenon.  The third study tested these ideas by randomly assigning 48 participants to either an eye movement or a no eye movement condition under two types of therapist instructions (reliving or distancing).  Participants recalled personal distressing memories, and measures of distress and vividness were taken after treatment and at follow up.  Only the eye movements made a significant difference to people's level of distress.  
 This conclusion appeared at odds with some of the previous literature that had tested the effects of eye movement on levels of distress.  A meta-analysis of some of this research had suggested that there was no significant advantage of including eye movement in EMDR treatment unless the person had been diagnosed with PTSD.  However, a close examination of this meta-analysis indicated some major methodological flaws in the computation; therefore, this was recalculated. The conclusion from this fourth study was consistent with study three in that EMDR with eye movement was found to lead to significantly greater improvement that EMDR without eye movement.  
 
 The results of these four studies were then discussed in terms of their implications for the theoretical models presented in Chapter 1. Aspects of learning theory that might account for EMDR efficiency were discussed as well as the failure of this model to account for treatment gains following EMDR.  Information processing models were seen to better account for some of the phenomena observed in EMDR and for the findings from the four studies.  Some suggestions of how eye movements might facilitate improved information processing were presented.
 
 Finally, the relative merits of EMDR and CBT treatments were discussed and suggestions made for when to combine approaches.  The conclusions highlight the point that EMDR appears to be the most promising treatment for PTSD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/152/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The need for realignment of primary science assessment to contemporary needs: assessment of learning and assessment for learning</field><field name="creator">Lee, Iris Chai Hong</field><field name="description">The ultimate purpose of this study was to investigate how to best prepare Singapore students for the Knowledge-based Economy (KBE). Investigating the possible need for the realignment of the primary science assessment to the KBE was of utmost interest as assessment was viewed as the driver of the actual curriculum.
 
 This was a mixed methods design study (Creswell, 2005). Fifteen teachers were first interviewed to ascertain the major features of primary school science assessment in both Perth, Western Australia and Singapore. A list of twelve questions was prepared for the eight teacher interviewees in Singapore and the seven teacher interviewees in Perth. The NUD*IST program was used to help organise trends in these teacher responses. Definitions of KBE skills were synthesised from literature reviews and validated by the fifteen teachers for the subsequent survey. The survey involved a list of demographic questions and two matrices. The first matrix required the teachers to rate, on a four-point scale, the use of the eleven assessment modes for the twelve 'process' and KBE skills. The second matrix was a frequency check to determine if the teachers had used a particular mode to assess a particular skill. One hundred and forty-five usable surveys were analysed. The Rasch analysis was performed through RUMM2020 program and unfolding model was sought through the program RateFOLD.
 
 The interviews first established that KBE skills and a variety of assessment modes were needed for today's classes. The survey confirmed these needs and found that the paper and pencil test was the most frequently used assessment procedures in Singapore and Perth. In both interviews and the survey, teachers were requested to match the skill(s) to the appropriate assessment mode(s) though the details and justification of such tasks were explained by the teachers in the interviews. In the process, other factors such as 'time constraints' and 'ranking of the teachers' were uncovered as 'hindrances' to teachers assessing the students appropriately for learning. The problems identified by the Singapore teachers were a lack of time, overloaded syllabi and the crucial perceived need of assessment of learning (high-stake summative tests).
 
 The results of both the interviews and survey supported the need for a variety of assessment modes (Gray and Sharp, 2001; Hackling, 2004; National Research Council, 1996, 2001 and 2003; Sebatane, 1998; Sterenberg, 1998) to help students learn science in today's contemporary classes. The Singapore teachers in this study were also appealing for help from the policy-makers to use a variety of assessment modes as the system that stipulated the use of the paper and pencil testing was beyond their control and jurisdiction.
 
 Recommendations that stemmed from this study include allowing teachers to use a variety of assessments to assess the students' learning in the high-stake Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and not just the paper and pencil mode that has been in used for at least the last thirty years. There are important implications as the learning theories that are currently used to support the assessment of learning are no longer sufficient nor in total alignment with the needs for today's class. For example, a behaviourist taxonomy of skills emphasises the measurable output and not the process of learning. Socio-constructivist approaches that focus on the individual constructing meaning in hislher context such as the use of ongoing formative assessment to encourage feedback (Black and Wiliam, 1998a and b) may assist in engaging the students in lifelong learning which is required in the KBE.
 
 Lastly, the significance of this study lies in two aspects, the practical and the scholarly. This study provides the evidence for the need primary science assessment to be more aligned to contemporary needs. This in turn will assist in better preparing the young of Singapore, who are the nation's only natural resource, for the workforce. This study also aims to contribute to the body of knowledge in three ways. Firstly, KBE needs will be connected to the primary science classroom via assessment of skills. Secondly, both KBE and process skills were found to be more appropriately assessed by assessment modes such as portfolio and paper and pencil respectively, as demonstrated through the analysis by Rasch and unfolding models. Thirdly, the gap between the implemented and official curriculum will be narrowed with this proposed change in assessment processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/153/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UMNO factionalism and the politics of Malaysian national identity</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jaehyon</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses UMNO factionalism from the perspective of the elite's manipulation of the various modes of nationalisms. This thesis argues that UMNO factionalism, which is seemingly a power struggle between competing UMNO elites, has been significantly shaped by contesting nationalist ideologies that reflect the unresolved questions of national identity in Malaysia.
 
 These two issues, that is, nationalism and UMNO factionalism, have shaped Malaysian politics in significant ways. UMNO factionalism has been related to such major political events as the 1969 ethnic riots, the introduction of the New Economic Policy, the UMNO split in 1987 and the Reformasi (Reform) movement in 1998. Frequently, the impact of these disputes extended beyond UMNO politics and affected wider Malaysian politics. At the same time, due to unresolved questions of national identity, nationalism has occupied a central position in Malaysian political discourse. There are ambiguities regarding the relationships among the various ethnic identities and national identity and between the individual and the larger Malaysian community that enable elites to construct and manipulate nationalist ideologies. In this thesis, the conflicting nationalisms are captured by five different concepts of nationalism - ethnocultural, civic and multicultural nationalisms in one group and collectivist-authoritarian and individualistic-libertarian nationalisms in another.
 
 The Malaysian Prime Ministers have constructed nationalist ideology to define the Malaysian nation in their attempts to resolve the unresolved problems of national identity. The challengers' arguments, to mobilise the community, mirror the community's (negative) responses to the Malaysian Prime Ministers' nationalist visions. In addition, the ideological arguments in the disputes extend the dispute beyond the elites, involving the community as well. Furthermore, because of the ideological conflicts, these factional disputes affect the direction of government policies in significant ways. This study shows that UMNO factional disputes have followed this pattern of ideological conflicts, although the exact contents may vary.
 
 The 1969 factional dispute was a clash between Tunku Abdul Rahman's shift towards multicultural nationalism and its challengers' ethnocultural nationalism. Tunku Abdul Rahman's nationalist vision moved away from ethnocultural nationalism in pursuit of national integration. The challengers, reflecting the Malay community's response to the Prime Minister's vision, took a strong ethnocultural Malay nationalist stance. The successful mobilisation of the Malay community by ethnocultural Malay nationalists contributed to the policy shift towards ethnocultural nationalism in the 1970s. In the 1987 dispute, Mahathir's economic policy, which moved away from ethnocultural nationalism, was challenged by Razaleigh's ethnocultural nationalist argument. After the dispute, Mahathir could only mobilise the community by tactically employing the rhetoric of ethnocultural Malay nationalism.
 
 In the 1990s, Mahathir's attempt to define the national identity of Malaysia by constructing a civic Malaysian nation, Bangsa Malaysia, relieved the tension surrounding the ambiguous national identity of Malaysia. It was facilitated by rapid economic growth that ameliorated ethnic contests over limited economic resources. However, the collectivist-authoritarian aspect of Mahathir's nationalism raised another nationalist question concerning the subordination of individual liberty and rights to the collective community's will and interests - a nationalism that justified his authoritarian rule. There was tension between an increasingly confident civic Malaysian society and Mahathir's collectivist-authoritarian control of the society. The 1998 UMNO dispute was a clash between Mahathir's collectivist-authoritarian nationalism and Anwar Ibrahim's individualistic-libertarian nationalism. The latter attempted to mobilise Malaysian society with his nationalist position (the Reformasi movement) which was expressed in the demand for liberal political reform. After the dispute, Mahathir was able to regain lost political ground through the politics of fear. It seems, however, that the fundamental question remains unresolved. This unresolved tension between the demand for individual liberty and rights and authoritarian control by state elites is likely to shape the ideological arguments in future UMNO factional disputes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/154/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorising the Chinese diaspora: Chinese Canadian and Chinese Australian narratives</field><field name="creator">Lee, Regina</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a study of Chinese diasporic narratives from Canada and Australia and examines the formation and negotiation of diasporic cultural identity and consciousness. Drawing upon theoretical discussions on diasporas in general, it investigates how the Chinese diaspora is imagined and represented, as a visible minority group, within the context of the multicultural nation state. 
 
 This dissertation begins with a taxonomy of the modes of explaining diaspora and offers three ways of theorising diasporic consciousness. In analysing the filmic and fictional narrative forms of the Chinese in Canada and Australia, the practices of cultural self-representation and of minority group participation and enjoyment of the nation are foregrounded in order to advance critical analysis of the Chinese diaspora. While taking into account the heterogeneity of the imagined diasporic Chinese community, this study also contends that the formation and negotiation of diasporic consciousness and diasporic cultural identity politics is strongly and invariably affected by the multicultural conditions and policies of their host countries. The adaptation and manifestation of minority groups' cultural practices are thus a matter of social, cultural and political contingencies more often aligned with dominant cultural expectations and manipulations than with the assertiveness of more empowered minority group participation. This dissertation therefore argues for a broader and more complex understanding of diasporic cultural and identity politics in the widespread attempts to merge and incorporate minority group narratives into the key foundational ('grand') narratives of the white nation state. The importance of reinscribing Chinese diasporic histories into the cultural landscapes of their receiving countries is moreover increasingly propelled by the speed and momentum of globalisation that has resulted in the growing number of multicultural societies on the one hand but also led to the homogenisation of cultural differences and diversities.
 
 In focussing on the fictional and filmic narratives from Canada and Australia, the diversity of the Chinese diasporic community and their conditions are emphasised in order to reflect upon the differences in the administration and practice of multiculturalism in these two countries. The comparative reading of Chinese-Canadian and Chinese-Australian novels and films locates its analysis of notions of 'homeland' and belonging, community and national and cultural citizenship within the context of the development and negotiation of diasporic identity politics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/155/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shelter in the storm: business turmoil and marketing strategy effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Lewandowska, Aleksandra</field><field name="description">Numerous studies have shown a positive association between the marketing concept and performance, however, it is not clear to what degree this relationship is moderated by the business environment. It is also uncertain which dimensions of the Narver and Slater (1990) measure of market orientation explain the relationship. Research conducted in four countries (Australia, China, Singapore and the Netherlands) of 217 companies found a strong association between market orientated strategies and company performance. Further, results of the research suggest that a customer orientated strategy may be a more appropriate strategy for a company to pursue when operating in a disturbed reactive or a turbulent business environment. The societal marketing concept, was found to be positively associated with company performance, and used as a 'pre-emptive' strategy by firms operating in a placid clustered environment. It would thus seem that a customer orientated strategy is more important in  very turbulent environments, such as those after September 11th, 2001, than first thought.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/156/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Keeping the bastards honest': the promise and practice of freedom of information legislation</field><field name="creator">Lidberg, Johan</field><field name="description">In the last decade the number of countries that have enacted Freedom of Information (FOI) laws have increased dramatically. In many respects FOI laws have become a democratic 'right of passage'. No FOI, no 'proper' democracy.
 
 The promises of FOI regimes are far-reaching: access to personal information and increased transparency in the form of third-party independent access to government-held information will prevent corruption and maladministration and encourage the public to participate more fully in the political process. But are the promises borne out by the practice of FOI?
 
 To answer this question this thesis will track a number of real-life FOI requests in five countries. Based on this and other data this project will lay the foundation for the first International Freedom of Information Index, ranking five countries on how their FOI regimes deliver on the promises made. Included in the ranking will also be an evaluation of the legal situation for media whistleblowers and shield laws for journalists.
 
 The thesis will show that it is easier to promise information access than to implement it. It will demonstrate that for most of the countries of study FOI laws serve more as a PR tool projecting an illusion of an informed public, rather than granting real independent access to quality information.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/157/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do pet cats (Felis catus) have an impact on species richness and abundance of native mammals in low-density Western Australian suburbia?</field><field name="creator">Lilith, Maggie</field><field name="description">Cat ownership in Australia is declining compared to an increasing trend of cat ownership in the United Kingdom, United States and Europe. The decline in Australia may be linked to concerns over perceived impacts of cat predation and an associated dislike of cats. However, while there are numerous studies on feral cats and their impacts on declining native fauna, the impact of pet cats on suburban wildlife or fauna in remnant bushland is relatively unknown although there is a wide perception of risk. The primary aim of this thesis was to apply the precautionary principle to the question of the putative impact of pet cats on the abundance and diversity of small mammals in urban bushland adjacent to low-density suburbia in the City of Armadale, a municipality on the south-east fringe of Perth, Western Australia. At the time of writing, Western Australia is yet to introduce state legislation governing cat control although many local councils within the state have either implemented or are in the process of implementing cat regulations.
 
 The precautionary principle was deemed an ideal approach to this question, because it provides a rationale for deciding on possible actions where both the potential risk to environmental values and the uncertainty about possible impacts are high. In such cases the precautionary principle requires two broad lines of action: firstly, detailed consultation with stakeholders to determine their perceptions of risk and the actions they are prepared to take to reduce it and, secondly, research to reduce uncertainty.
 
 With regard to stakeholder consultation, local residents were surveyed in regard to their attitudes and current cat husbandry practices. A substantial proportion of respondents within this municipality believed cat regulations were necessary (75% of owners and 95% of non-owners). At least 70% of both owners and non-owners agreed with the propositions that cats not owned by licensed breeders should be desexed, local councils should restrict the maximum number of cats that can be owned on one property and that pet cats entering nature reserves are harmful to wildlife. Most (c.85%) cat owners agreed that they would license their cats if that became compulsory. Although fewer owners (c.60%) were prepared to keep their cats on their property at all times to protect wildlife, over 80% were willing to confine their cats at night if it was required. Owners seemed to be substantially motivated by the value of these measures in reducing injury to cats and facilitating the return of lost animals rather than concern over wildlife protection.
 
 Attempts to reduce uncertainty involved (i) assessing roaming patterns of pet cats to determine the sizes of appropriate buffer zones around nature reserves, and (ii) determining species diversity, species richness and abundance of small mammals in remnant bushland adjacent to sub-divisions with varying regulations governing cat husbandry. Radio tracking results to assess cat roaming patterns showed substantial variation in home range size between cats in high density suburbia (ranged between 0.01 ha - 0.64 ha) and those in low density suburbia (ranged from 0.07 ha - 2.86ha). Larger home range sizes of cats in the rural areas (up to 2.9 ha) suggest buffer zones of up to 500 metres around nature reserves are needed to exclude almost all roaming cats. The abundance and species richness of small mammals were investigated in four areas of remnant bushland. Two were adjacent to subdivisions where cat ownership was unrestricted, one next to a subdivision where cat ownership was prohibited and the remaining one next to a subdivision where compulsory night curfew and bells on pet cats were enforced. No definitive evidence of predatory impact by pet cats on the small mammals was found. Mammal species diversity was not significantly different between sites and species richness and absolute abundance were not higher in sites where cats were restricted. Vegetation comparisons showed significant differences in the structure and species composition of the vegetation between most sites and the mammal species richness and abundance appeared linked to ground cover density in the various sites. This factor, not cat restrictions, appeared to be the primary determinant of species richness, species diversity and absolute numbers of small mammals in these sites.
 
 This study in the City of Armadale has shown that the implementation of proposed cat legislation must have a 'whole of ecosystem' approach, i.e. protecting identified remnant bushland containing biodiversity from threatening processes such as plant disease and inappropriate fire, especially arson, as well as possible predations from pet cats. Habitat restoration and protection may be more important conservation activities than regulation of cats. Regulation of cats can be done at differing levels of intensity and cost, bearing in mind that this community is receptive to regulation of some aspects of cat ownership. Community education on the values of cat confinement in regards to cat welfare might increase chances of compliance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/158/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing learning conversations: a study of the discourse and learner experiences of online synchronous discussions</field><field name="creator">Lim, Hwee Ling</field><field name="description">The aim of this qualitative case study is to gain greater insight into the impact of online synchronous (chat) interaction on the learning process from a sociocultural constructivist perspective in the context of an online undergraduate unit. Given the sparse research on the effectiveness of chat interaction in supporting knowledge construction processes, few appropriate analytical methods available for examining educational chat discourse, together with the pedagogical imperative to determine the extent to which the real-time computer-mediated communication (CMC) mode satisfies student learning needs, this study fills the gaps in current research by examining the impact of chat interaction in facilitating participation, knowledge construction, and quality of online learning experience of two different online tutorial groups.
 
 Although the literature largely regards chat interaction as fragmented and characterized by interactional incoherence that disrupts the dialogic knowledge construction process, findings from this single-embedded case study of tutorial groups 1 and 4 (G1 and G4), involved in weekly critical discussions on set-readings over 11 weeks (one semester), show that chat interaction is more structured and complex than the literature suggests.
 
 This study utilizes a new methodological design that integrates discourse and social network analytical methods which are triangulated with self-reports of learning experiences from an online survey instrument. The application of a refined Exchange Structure Analysis coding instrument (Kneser, Pilkington, and Treasure-Jones, 2001) with social network analysis (Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000) to transcripts of chat interaction shows educational chat discourse to be coherent; reflecting the typical structure of pedagogical classroom exchanges. Findings from this study further establish that chat interaction enables participation opportunities in tutorial discussions which are valued as important, with variations in levels of participation within and between groups suggesting a pattern of active and peripheral participation which is not necessarily detrimental to learning. 
 
 Chat interaction is also found to facilitate collaborative sharing of individual understandings and critical negotiation of meaning which are characteristic of the knowledge construction process, in the form of information-sharing and topic development phases in the exchanges of both groups. Although it is beyond the scope of this study to determine the exact form of knowledge constructed, individual and mutual appropriations of shared knowledge through chat interaction are reported by both groups. 
 
 A between group comparison of available tutor scaffolding reveals consistently weak G1 tutor presence compared to strong G4 tutor support at the initial learning stages with gradual withdrawal of scaffolding over time. These results suggest differences in quality of online educational experiences which are confirmed by findings that compared to G1, G4 reported greater satisfaction with more chat tutorial factors; indicating an overall more positive, higher quality of experience with collaborative learning and group work processes afforded by the chat interaction.
 
 With its methodological design, instruments, and findings, this study contributes to existing knowledge on online interaction, advances on previous studies regarding impact of chat interaction on learning, and offers directions for future work in the fields of educational technology, linguistics, and group dynamics in educational social networks. When extrapolated to comparable cases, findings from this study could guide the pedagogical design of collaborative-constructivist learning activities that takes into account the role of chat interaction in the construction of learning conversations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/159/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arthur William Upfield: a biography</field><field name="creator">Lindsey, Travis Barton</field><field name="description">This dissertation is an exhaustive account of the life and work of Arthur William Upfield (1890-1964). It is presented as a critical biography and narrates the life of the writer, in his socio-cultural milieu, from birth. It also positions Upfield as a writer who dealt with issues of Aboriginality at a time when this was a singularly polemical subject. My work is informed by the theory of Zygmunt Bauman and others and is posited in the context of late-modern biography theory. 
 
 English-born, Upfield arrived in Australia in 1911 and took work in the bush, serving overseas with the Australian army at the outbreak of World War I and marrying an Australian army nurse in Egypt. Returning with his wife and son to Australia in 1921 he intermittently carried his swag until he was employed patrolling the Western Australian number 1 rabbit-proof fence for three years to 1931. By that time he had published four novels, including two crime novels featuring his fictional creation, the part-Aboriginal, part-European, Detective-Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte ('Bony'), arguably the first fully-developed character in Australian popular fiction.
 
 Leaving the fence, Upfield settled with his family in Perth and wrote full-time until joining the Melbourne Herald in 1933. Retrenched, he resumed career writing to be further interrupted by a war-time intelligence posting in 1939. In 1943 the first Bony mysteries were published in America, where Upfield's critical success was maintained until his death. In 1945 he left his wife for Jessica Uren, to whom he remained devoted.
 
 Upfield's in all twenty-nine Bony novels, many of which have been translated across eleven languages, afforded him notable success both at home and abroad, in good part due to his descriptive gifts and the uniqueness of his fictional character, the part-Aboriginal Bony.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/160/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effectiveness of parental provisioning under variable oceanographic conditions along the Western Australian coast in two shearwater species: the little shearwater Puffinus assimilis tunneyi and the wedge-tailed shearwater Puffinus pacificus</field><field name="creator">Asmussen, Indre Kirsten</field><field name="description">Parental provisioning was investigated in two congeneric shearwater species, the winter breeding Little Shearwater Puffinus assimilis tunneyi and summer breeding Wedge-tailed Shearwater Puffinus pacificus. The Western Australian coast is characterised by climatic and oceanographic instability largely linked to the variable flow rate of the Leeuwin Current generated by differences in global climatic conditions. Ongoing long-term studies at the Western Australian coast have indicated that this climate driven phenomenon affects seabird reproductive participation and success. Such an ongoing, parallel study of Wedge-tailed Shearwater reproduction effectively provided this thesis with a background index of oceanographic conditions, or a context in which to view and interpret the ability of adults to provide parental care to the dependent nestling. Such an index of oceanographic conditions is generally lacking in studies of seabird provisioning. Fortuitously, this study was conducted in what appeared to be a favourable year (2000), a transition year (2001) and a less favourable year (2002) for seabird reproduction off the Western Australian coast. Consequently, it was possible to comment on the effectiveness of parental provisioning during different oceanographic conditions.
 
 In this thesis, parental provisioning encompassed the delivery of a range of resources to the dependent nestling, including a burrow, heat during incubation, protection from predators, brooding after hatching, and the delivery of food to sustain growth and development. The main focus of the study was the nestling feeding stage, although other more sensitive and less flexible phases were investigated in the Little Shearwater. Most research focused on the winter breeding Little Shearwater, as the species least studied. Adult Little Shearwaters were present at the nest throughout the night during the nestling feeding period, which presented the opportunity to examine provisioning from an adult perspective. Adult responses are discussed in the context of this index of oceanographic condition, in terms of regional food resources levels, and also more localised weather patterns which facilitate shearwater locomotion. A potential two-tier adult state-dependent mechanism of parental resource allocation is presented, which would allow a mobile K-strategist, foraging within an acceptable distance from the breeding colony, to persist in this relatively unstable and unpredictable environment.
 
 This research suggests that parents' adjusted parental provisioning in order to minimise risks to the functional adult, which had attained its reproductive potential at the expense of the nestling that may or may not attain reproductive status. The weights of adult encountered at the colony did not differ significantly between different phases of the breeding season (pre-laying, incubation and nestling feeding) or between years. It appeared as if the weights of adults engaged in parental provision fluctuated within an acceptable 'working' range whilst present at the colony, which makes it difficult to define average adult weights. The theory of threshold adult body condition suggests that only adults above a sufficient body condition are allocating resources towards reproduction, and therefore present at the breeding colony. Whilst, adults below a threshold are expected to be absent from the colony and therefore not willing to allocate resources to support the dependent nestling.
 
 In the two-tier adult state dependent allocation of parental care, firstly the body condition of the adult will determine if it is present at the colony, hence providing care for the offspring. Secondly if the adult is able to maintain adult body condition provisioning can be reactive to the needs (or body condition) of the nestling. Evidently, such a system of parental provisioning predominantly based on the ability to maintain adult body condition will be affected by differences in oceanographic and climatic conditions, which affect the ability of adults to maintain or replenish body condition within an acceptable time and distance away from the colony. The level and continuity of parental care provided by the pair will be discussed, especially how deviations from an optimal provisioning schedule may affect nestling growth, survival and viability.
 
 Ongoing, long term research of summer breeding Wedge-tailed Shearwaters along the Western Australian coast suggests that reproduction is adversely affected by prevailing negative southern oscillation indices and associated declines in the flow rate of the warm, low density Leeuwin Current. Despite breeding in the austral winter when the maximal flow rates of the Leeuwin Current are expected, Little Shearwater reproduction was also affected in a manner similar to that documented for tropical seabirds breeding in summer. Furthermore, decreases in productivity registered by local fisheries suggested that observed declines in seabird reproduction may be linked to an overall crash in productivity experienced along the Western Australian coast during years of weak Leeuwin Current flow. Such years are associated with more uniform and cold offshore water temperatures. Consequently, a regional lack of oceanographic resources, within an acceptable distance of the breeding site, are likely to adversely affect the ability of adults to replenish body condition, however other factors such as prevailing weather are also likely to affect energy expenditure during travel and foraging. Both factors would affect the ability of adults' to maintain body conditions.
 
 In a favourable year, Little Shearwaters were able to meet nestling needs and the amount of food delivered matched the pattern of weight gain typical for Procellariiform young. Conversely, in a less favourable year, Little Shearwaters delivered food to young less often and the amount delivered was erratic, as the percentage of nestlings fed was consistently lower and temporal delivery was more irregular in the less favourable year. Nonetheless, food delivery also changed with nestling age, following a pattern similar to a favourable year, but at a lower rate.
 
 Future research should focus on the level of obesity attained by cohorts under different conditions and possibly the quality of feathers produced by nestlings. Feather quality and the state of obesity attained may affect the post-fledging buffer and ultimately affect fledging survival.
 
 Supplementary feeding suggested that adult Wedge-tailed Shearwaters adjusted feeding in response to proximal needs of nestlings, as supplementary fed nestlings were fed less than non-supplementary fed nestling. Furthermore, in both species adults changed provisioning to meet the changing needs of nestlings throughout ontogeny however the adult's ability to respond to changing needs may be dependent upon the body condition of the adult and therefore ultimately dictated by resource availability. These results are in accord with other studies in which adults have altered provisioning in response to changing nestling needs. Whilst in other studies adults displayed an inability to react to nestling needs, which may have been linked to the difficulty faced by adult to maintain their own body condition during a less favourable year.
 
 The tentative mechanism of parental provisioning may help to explain the often contradictory outcomes recorded in studies of parental provisioning conducted in the absence of an indicator of resources availability and context in which to interpret adult response. Since, adults adjusted provisioning to firstly match their ability to maintain their own body condition in response to oceanographic conditions and secondly if able to met their own needs, in accordance with nestling needs. Therefore, parental provisioning is a flexible, state-dependent behaviour ultimately limited by oceanographic conditions.
 
 Once nestlings have hatched and passed a critical weight, they are more likely to survive and parental provisioning has the potential to become a highly flexible behaviour as the offspring can absorb periods of reduced parental provisioning. This relatively 'forgiving' nestling phase is often targeted by studies of parental provisioning. Here, an optimal provisioning schedule may be orchestrated under favourable conditions however deviations may be absorbed without terminating the investment in reproduction.
 
 Although breeding at different times of the year, both species fed their nestling to a stage of obesity. This occurred, despite feeding nestlings near daily, which should have allowed adults to obtain regular feedback about the body condition of the nestling. Obesity may reflect the relatively unpredictable availability of resources along the Western Australian coast. However, adults may aim to increase the potential fitness of the nestling when adult body condition allows, through the provision of a post fledging buffer in terms of stored energy and high quality, structurally sound plumage.
 
 At the Western Australian coast, Little Shearwaters used a bimodal strategy to care for nestlings during incubation and feeding. Adults lost weight during periods of intensive provisioning, namely incubation and nestling feeding, but if too much weight was lost, provisioning was withheld and adults departed for a longer absence. Whilst absent from the colony for a prolonged period of time adults gained weight, both during the incubation and nestling feeding period. Return of birds from long absences appeared to be related to the predictable passage of weather systems.
 
 In Little Shearwater, during incubation the efforts of both parents were highly coordinated in a favourable year, since egg neglect was low, presumably as a consequence of predation pressure. Weather appeared to assist in the arrival of the relieving adult during incubation. Similarly during the transition to nestling feeding, the nocturnal activity at the breeding site indicated that the return of adults from long absences was associated with predictable changes in wind direction, related to the inevitable passage of weather systems, rather than wind strength, which is directly proportional to pressure differences between adjacent weather systems.
 
 In a favourable year, during nestling feeding the co-ordination of change overs between individuals within a pair also appeared to be high. Consequently, patterns of provisioning may be entrained throughout the duration of the breeding season, including incubation and nestling feeding, by an underlying pattern generated by the predictable passage of weather systems. Adults able to meet their own needs in a time frame dictated by the movement of weather system may minimise travel costs, whilst returning in time to allow the partner to depart to meet its needs. Both partners are required for the co-ordination of parental care to produce an optimal provisioning schedule. Consequently, activities are expected to be structured to protect not only the body condition of the self, but also of the partner in a species where biparental care is generally required to successfully raise an offspring.
 
 During nestling feeding, in a favourable year the co-ordinated bimodal strategy achieved near daily delivery of food, whilst in a less favourable year deviations from this pattern occurred, as adults spent more time at sea. The average duration of long absences, used to replenish body condition, appeared to increase during less favourable years. Further research should focus on variations in temporal absences and adult weights under different conditions that affect the ability of adults to replenish their body conditions. Furthermore, not all pairs were able to achieve daily food delivery during each year, and during a less favourable year a larger proportion of the breeding population appeared to be unable to deliver continuous parental care. Consequently, a larger proportion of nestlings remained unfed. The disruption in the input system, or deviations from a potentially optimal provisioning schedule, resulted in differences in growth rates between years. Costs incurred by adults during less favourable conditions appeared to be passed on to the nestling, whilst the risks to the functional adult that had reached reproductive potential were minimised.
 
 Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, breeding during the austral summer in a favourable year, were able to meet nestling needs. Here, food was delivered at a pattern that matched weight gain, where total overnight food delivered changed with nestling age, as in the Little Shearwaters. Wedge-tailed Shearwaters did not deliver food as regularly as Little Shearwaters. The colony of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters appeared to experience periods of reduced provisioning, during low wind conditions associated with dissipating tropical lows. During such conditions, Wedge-tailed Shearwater adults were often seen rafting at sea away from the breeding site suggesting it was energy expensive to fly. Such periods of poor provisioning associated with low wind speeds were recorded at different latitudes along the Western Australian coast and in different years. Dissipating tropical lows which generate low wind conditions are a seasonal occurrence however the frequency, persistence and intensity of such tropical lows appeared to fluctuate with offshore sea surface temperatures, frequency of tropical cyclones to the north and ultimately prevailing large scale climatic conditions that affect seas surface temperatures. Consequently, prevailing short term weather conditions which are affected by large scale climatic events, including climate change, have the potential to influence Wedge-tailed Shearwater reproduction.
 
 Wedge-tailed Shearwater nestlings supplementarily fed during a dissipating tropical low were visited and fed less than unfed nestlings of lower body condition. This implies that adults adjusted provisioning in accordance with nestling body condition. However, nestlings that had not been supplementarily fed were visited less often once conditions improved, suggesting that parents were unable to sustain food delivery. Parents of supplementarily fed nestlings, which had reduced provisioning during the adverse conditions, were able to feed their nestlings at a higher rate once conditions recovered then parents with non-supplementary fed nestlings. Thus, parents appeared to adjust provisioning in relation to nestling body condition however the ability of adults to maintain high levels of parental care appears to be limited, possibly by parental body condition. Similarly, adults reacted to the changing needs of a nestling throughout ontogeny in a favourable year, whilst during an adverse year deviation from a more optimal pattern of provisioning was evident. Meal sizes delivered by different species are often compared. However, food delivery appears to be adjusted with nestling age and differences in oceanographic conditions.
 
 Consequently, an optimal amount of food matching the developmental needs of the nestling may be met during optimal conditions using an optimal pattern of provisioning, whilst deviations from this may give an index of parental inability to cope with long or short-term deterioration in oceanic conditions, which ultimately affect their ability to meet adult needs. Furthermore, meal sizes are often determined during frequent weighing research of short duration, which is easily affected by proximal conditions that could affect the ability of adults to travel and would reflect the developmental stage of the nestling. Therefore, for meal sizes quoted it is not know if adults were able to engage in an optimal provisioning schedule or if deviations occur to compensate for below optimal conditions.
 
 Comparison of meal size by weight alone may not be feasible, even throughout a season within a species, as a seasonal shift in diet was recorded for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters during the breeding season using stable isotope. The different diets of different species often living in different geographic locations and the ability of some species to produce stomach oil, further confounds the ability to compare meal sizes by weight alone. It appears difficult to define a meal size characteristic for a species and make direct comparisons based on weight alone a practice widespread in seabird research. At best an optimal meal size for a given developmental stage may be used in conjunction with calorific values to calculate an optimal energy input for a specific age to compare between species.
 
 The seasonal difference in diet recorded during the Wedge-tailed Shearwater breeding season revealed a shift from a higher to a lower trophic level. This is consistent with females engaging in a pre-laying exodus where preferred resources may be targeted, whilst during nestling feeding foraging constraints are introduced as foraging occurs around a central location. A broader range of prey may be targeted within an acceptable distance from the breeding colony, including scavenging behind Western Rock Lobster fishing vessels which provide a predictable source of food or discarded often imported bait.
 
 The application of stable isotope analysis provided promising insights into shearwater foraging behaviour otherwise difficult to elucidate. Different resources were targeted by the two species during egg membrane formation. Wedge-tailed Shearwaters generally appeared to forage at a higher trophic level than Little Shearwaters, although outliers suggest that Little Shearwaters also have the potential to target higher trophic levels. Differences in diet during egg formation were evident between different colonies of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters breeding at different locations.
 
 Consequently, stable isotope analysis may be used to track changes in diet between favourable and less favourable years, where increased foraging constraints are expected to emerge. Stable isotope analysis is a promising technique and interpretation of data will increase with further understanding of ecosystem dynamics and the development of a reference library.
 
 Direct observation at sea suggested that Little Shearwaters forage in deep, offshore in areas most likely influenced by the Leeuwin Current. They were not observed to forage in the cooler, inshore waters fed by a northwards flowing counter current, on the continental shelf between the Houtman Abrolhos Islands and the mainland. Maximum depth gauges revealed a maximal dive depth of approximately 34 m. The maximal dive depths recorded appeared to increases with time spent at sea, as indicated by birds engaged in short absences (near daily returns) from the colony and long absences (approximately weekly returns) when they were replenishing body condition. Long absences were recorded after an incubation shift or a period of daily nestling feeding.
 
 To summarise, a tentative mechanism of adult state-dependent allocation of parental provisioning in which pelagic seabirds persist in environments of fluctuating resource levels was proposed. This may be based upon the ability of adults to operate above a threshold body condition, which is ultimately dictated by resource availability and proximal conditions which affect the ability of adults to maintain their own body condition. Once adults struggle to maintain their body condition, a disruption in the co-ordination of the parental care orchestrated between the members of a pair can arise, as adults spend more time away from the colony replenishing their body condition. This results in a deviation from an optimal provisioning schedule, which is achievable in favourable years when resource levels and proximal conditions facilitate easy maintenance of the pair's body condition. In this system, any costs incurred whilst struggling to replenish or maintain adult body condition are passed on to the nestling. In a system where biparental care is necessary, incentive exists for one partner to also act in a manner that facilitates the protection of the body condition of the other partner.
 
 The nestling in turn may absorb such deviations from an optimal provisioning schedule in a manner that affects the development of temporary attributes, rather than fixed morphological attributes. This may be a testimony of the strong selective forces exerted by the ocean, which also discourages sexual dimorphism in pelagic seabirds. Reduced levels of provisioning recorded in less favourable years translated into lower average peak weights, smaller growth rates and however asymptotes reached generally did not differ significantly between years. However, the deviation from the optimal provisioning schedule during less favourable years may reduce the fitness of the fledgling, through a reduction in the post fledging buffer, including investment in a smaller post fledging fat deposits and decreased plumage quality. It is possible, that nestling shunt costs incurred away from skeletal or fixed attributes. The nestling once independent may overcome lower quality plumage and a smaller post fledging fat buffer, if conditions are favourable. Thereby, the offspring engages in its own risk minimisation strategy and makes the most of its only chance for survival.
 
 Within a species, temporal patterns of parent provisioning and consequently foraging strategies are flexible. Firstly, a species may engage in a different foraging strategy ranging from unimodal to bimodal in response to prevailing conditions at a given location that affect the ability of adults to maintain their own body condition. Consequently, even at the same location under different conditions a shift in foraging strategy may result. Secondly, an optimal provisioning schedule able to meet the needs of the nestling may only be realised during favourable conditions when a pair is able to co-ordinate their efforts. The proportion of the colony able to achieve optimal provision is expected to vary between years and resource availability, as does the proportion of the breeding population able to return to the colony and lay an egg.
 
 Consequently, nestling quality of the cohort may be affected by the adult state dependent input system, based upon adult risk minimisation. This has implications for climate change, which affects sea surface temperatures and consequently oceanographic productivity and prevailing weather patterns.
 
 Effectively, costs are passed on to the offspring whilst the reproductive potential of the adult or pair is maintained. Such flexibility allows iteroparous k-strategists, such as shearwaters, to persist successfully in areas of climatic and oceanographic variability, but may have implications on the post-fledging survival chances. In an adverse year, despite reaching lower average weights, a proportion of adults were still able to feed their nestlings to obesity, possibly highlighting differences in quality between pairs. Since the state of obesity reached and the quality of feather produced may translate into increased post-fledging survival chances for the nestling, the survival chances of nestlings produced by a breeding population may not be equal, as the level of parental care delivered may vary between pairs and years. The subtle adjustments in two tier adult state-dependent system of parental provisioning may alter the post-fledging survival chances of the cohort and this has implications on population dynamics in terms of climate change, which reach beyond easily observed reductions in breeding participation and success.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/161/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pathology of devil facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii)</field><field name="creator">Loh, Richmond</field><field name="description">The pathology of a disfiguring and debilitating fatal disease affecting a high proportion of the wild population of Tasmanian Devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) that was discovered is described. The disease, named devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), has been identified in devils found across 60% of the Tasmanian landscape. The prevalence of this disease was extremely variable, possibly reflecting seasonal trapping success. Between 2001 and 2004, 91 DFTD cases were obtained for pathological description. Grossly, the tumours presented as large, solid, soft tissue masses usually with flattened, centrally ulcerated and exudative surfaces. They were typically multi-centric, appearing first in the oral, face or neck regions. Histologically, the tumours were composed of circumscribed to infiltrative nodular aggregates of round to spindle-shaped cells often within a pseudocapsule and divided into lobules by delicate fibrous septae. They were locally aggressive and metastasised in 65% of cases. There was minimal cytological differentiation amongst the tumour cell population under light and electron microscopy. The diagnostic values of a number of immunohistochemical stains were employed to further characterise up to 50 representative cases. They were negative for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, von Willebrand factor, desmin, glial fibrillary acid protein, CD16, CD57, CD3 and LSP1. DFTD cells were positive for vimentin, S-100, melan A, neuron specific enolase, chromogranin A and synaptophysin.

The thesis asks this question of the life and work of female faith missionaries who served in Western Australia with the Australian Aborigines' Mission and/or the United Aborigines' Mission, during the twentieth century.
 
 In 1902, the New South Wales Aborigines' Mission adopted faith mission principles based on those of the China Inland Mission founded in 1865. The mission expanded into Western Australia in 1908 and changed its name to the Australian Aborigines' Mission. From 1929, it was known as the United Aborigines' Mission. The research began with a historiography of the China Inland Mission and the United Aborigines' Mission and its antecedents. The analysis of the principles of these two missions identified that some characteristics of a faith mission were present in the New South Wales Aborigines' Mission from the beginning and others were never adopted. It established that from 1902, the New South Wales Aborigines' Mission upheld the faith principles of trusting God to provide physical needs, not soliciting for funds and not entering into debt. Because most faith missionaries were female, the historiography proceeded to examine texts on women missionaries, including recent work by Australian writers. This recognised that issues of gender, race and class were present within both mission cultures.
 
 Five case studies were chosen to cover a period from 1912 when Bertha Telfer arrived in Western Australia until the retirement of Mary Jones in 1971. Using written and oral source material from Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives, the research studied the work of five female faith missionaries in south-west Australia: Bertha Telfer/Alcorn, Ethel Hamer/Fryer, Hope Malcolm/Wright, Mary Jones and Melvina Langley/Rowley, with a focus on issues of Evangelicalism, race, gender and class. Preliminary investigation of the women recognized that while only one had professional training and two received missionary training, membership of the interdenominational Christian Endeavour youth movement was a formative influence on all these female missionaries. An investigation into the principles of that organisation, founded in North America in 1881, established it was influenced by the 1858-59 Revival within Evangelicalism in England and North America and it placed a strong emphasis on personal conversion and a commitment to mission. Christian Endeavour spread to Australia by 1883 and was found to have provided limited leadership opportunities to women.
 
 The research tracked the experience of the female faith missionaries over six decades of living by faith among the Nyungar people and discovered a lack of identification with Indigenous culture that had its roots in a widely held belief in the superiority of western culture. Associated with this was the Evangelical belief in personal conversion that did not address cross-cultural issues. The UAM identification with the rise of fundamentalism from the 1920s coincided with diminished leadership opportunities for women at a time when women were gaining more choices in the wider Australian community.
 
 The thesis concludes that the role of faith missionary was costly to women in terms of their health and wellbeing. In the context of oppressive government policies towards Indigenous Australians, the poverty and marginalisation experienced by the women, when combined with compassion, created solidarity with Nyungar people. In some cases, this reduced the barriers of race and gender and resulted in the conversion of some Nyungar people, contributing to the formation of an Indigenous and Evangelical church. These findings are significant because they point to new understanding of mission, conversion and Aboriginal-missionary relations and cultures and of the role played by female faith missionaries in the shared mission history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Western Australians.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/163/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational culture in TAFE colleges: power, gender and identity politics</field><field name="creator">Lorrimar, Jane</field><field name="description">This study explores the human face of workplace change in two Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges in Western Australia. It analyses the impact of neoliberalism on organisational culture by examining the way vocational education and training (VET) reforms influenced the restructuring and orientation of these colleges, and changed their power dynamics and work practices. It presents the accounts of 100 women and men who were interviewed between 2000-2002 about their working lives. Their stories of passion and angst represent a 'vertical slice' of life in TAFE and include responses from administrative staff, lecturers, academic managers, corporate services managers and executives.
 
 This study explores perceptions of power and the mechanisms of control that were exerted upon and within the colleges with a focus on the factors that impact on career satisfaction. In addition, it examines perceptions of fairness in relation to employment, remuneration and promotion issues. Specifically, it reveals a variety of points of view on the attributes of success and outlines the strategies individuals use to get ahead. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the way values and norms guide and justify conduct and how they influence organisational culture. It evaluates whether a climate of sacrifice operates in the colleges and whether individuals will sacrifice personal or professional values to get ahead.
 
 Although much has been written on the impact of neoliberalism on the changing nature of work and organisational culture, there has been little investigation of the TAFE 'experience' at the individual, group and institutional level. It is also less common to find analyses of workplace restructuring that conceptualises the changes from a feminist and sociocultural perspective. By investigating the colleges as sites of gender and identity politics, this study explores the way individuals and groups do gender and describes how gender asymmetry is reproduced through social, cultural and institutional practices. It highlights how individuals construct their professional and worker identity and perceive themselves in relations to others in the social and organisational hierarchy of the colleges.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/164/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and evaluation of novel potential target (tubulin) for antimalarial chemotherapy</field><field name="creator">Low, CK Andrew</field><field name="description">Malaria has long affected the world both socially and economically. Annually, there are 1.5-2.7 million deaths and 300-500 million clinical infections (WHO, 1998). Several antimalarial agents (such as chloroquine, quinine, pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, sulphadoxine and others) have lost their effectiveness against this disease through drug resistance being developed by the malarial parasites (The- Wellcome-Trust, 1999). Although there is no hard-core evidence of drug resistance shown on the new antimalarial compounds (artemisinin and artesunate), induced resistant studies in animal models have demonstrated that the malarial parasites have capabilities to develop resistance to these compounds (Ittarat et al., 2003; Meshnick, 1998; Meshnick, 2002; Walker et al., 2000). Furthermore, a useful vaccine has yet to be developed due to the complicated life cycle of the malarial parasites (The- Wellcome-Trust, 1999). As such, the re-emergence of this deadly infectious disease has caused an urgent awareness to constantly look for novel targets and compounds. 
 
 In this present study, Plasmodium falciparum (clone 3D7) was cultured in vitro in human red blood cells for extraction of total RNA which was later reverse transcribed into cDNA. The alphaI-, alphaII- and beta-tubulin genes of the parasite were then successfully amplified and cloned into a bacterial protein expression vector, pGEX- 6P-1. The tubulin genes were then sequenced and analysed by comparison with previously published homologues. It was found that the sequenced gene of alpha-Itubulin was different at twelve bases, of which only six of these had resulted in changes in amino acid residues. alphaII- and beta-tubulin genes demonstrated 100% sequence similarity with the published sequences of clone 3D7, but differences were observed between this clone and other strains (strains NF54 and 7G8) of beta-tubulin. Nevertheless, the differences were minor in alphaI- and beta-tubulins and there was greater than 99% homology. Subsequently, all three Plasmodium recombinant tubulin proteins were separately expressed and purified. Insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) of these recombinant tubulins were also refolded and have been tested positive for their structural characteristics in Western blot analysis. 
 
 Both soluble and refolded recombinant tubulins of malaria were examined in a drugtubulin interaction study using sulfhydryl reactivity and fluorescence quenching techniques. Known tubulin inhibitors (colchicine, tubulozole-c and vinblastine) and novel synthetic compounds (CCWA-110, 239 and 443) were used as the drug compounds to determine the dynamics and kinetics of the interactions. In addition, mammalian tubulin was also used to determine the potential toxicity effects of these compounds. Similarities were observed with other published reports in the binding of colchicine with the recombinant tubulins, hence confirming proposed binding sites of this compound on the Plasmodium recombinant tubulins. Two synthetic compounds (CCWA-239 and 443) that have previously tested positive against P. falciparum in vitro were found to bind effectively with all three tubulin monomers, while displaying low binding interactions with the mammalian tubulin, thus indicating that these compounds have potential antimalarial activity. Therefore, this study has satisfied and fulfilled all the aims and hypotheses that have previously been stated.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/165/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sporulation of Stagonospra nodorum</field><field name="creator">Lowe, Rohan George Thomas</field><field name="description">Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that is the causal agent of leaf and glume blotch on wheat. Very little is currently known about the molecular mechanisms required for pathogenicity of S. nodorum, despite its major impact on Australian agriculture. S. nodorum is a polycyclic pathogen. Rain-splashed pycnidiospores attach to and colonise wheat tissue and subsequently sporulate within 2-3 weeks. Several cycles of infection are needed to build up inoculum for the damaging infection of flag leaves and heads, sporulation is therefore a critical component of the infection cycle of S. nodorum; our aim is to determine the genetic and biochemical requirements for sporulation for development of control of the pathogen. Disease progression of S. nodorum on wheat cv. Amery was monitored by light microscopy to determine the time point when pycnidia development began. Early pycnidia development was evident 12 days post-infection. This information was used to guide a genomics and a metabolomics based approach to determine the requirements for sporulation in S. nodorum. The genomics approach utilised two cDNA libraries created from sporulating and non-sporulating cultures. EST frequency was used to determine highly expressed genes under the two developmental states. Gene expression from the most highly represented genes during sporulation were confirmed using quantitative PCR. A gene encoding an arabitol 4-dehydrogenase (Abd1), was mutagenised, in its absence sporulation was reduced by approximately 20%. The metabolomics approach isolated metabolites from both in planta infection and in vitro growth. Rapid changes in the abundance of metabolites were detected during the onset of sporulation. Key fungal metabolites identified include mannitol and trehalose. The concentration of both mannitol and trehalose increased dramatically in concert with pycnidia formation. Both mannitol and trehalose have also been linked to pathogenicity in filamentous fungi. Creation of deletion mutants of the gene encoding trehalose 6-phosphate synthase showed the synthesis of trehalose is required for full sporulation of S. nodorum in planta and in vitro.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/166/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water stress and disease development in Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) infected with Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Anne</field><field name="description">The south-west of Western Australia has a Mediterranean climate and flora endemic to this area, including the keystone species, jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), have adapted to the droughted summer conditions. The introduction of an exotic soil borne pathogen, Phytophthora cinnamomi, has challenged the survival of this and many other species. The expectation might be that plants stressed by drought are more susceptible to disease and this study examined the development of disease caused by P. cinnamomi in E. marginata and the significance of water status to that development.
 
 Seedlings of E. marginata, clonal plants resistant to P. cinnamomi and clonal plants susceptible to P. cinnamomi, were subjected to different watering regimes in a number of field and glasshouse experiments. To determine the level of drought stress that could be imposed on container-grown E. marginata seedlings without killing them, a preliminary experiment progressively lowered the moisture levels of the substrate in their containers, until the plants reached wilting point, at which time moisture was restored to a predetermined droughted level and the process repeated. With each subsequent droughting the wilting point was lower until it was found that the seedlings could survive when only 5% of the moisture lost from container capacity to wilting point was restored. 
 
 No deaths had occurred after seedlings had been maintained at this low level for 14 days (Chapter 2). Based on these findings, the level of droughting maintained in all experiments conducted under controlled glasshouse conditions was 10% restoration. After testing the appropriateness of underbark inoculation, and a zoospore inoculation method for which no wounding was necessary, a new, non-invasive stem inoculation technique was developed. Stems were moistened in a pre-treatment, then agar plugs colonized with P. cinnamomi mycelium were held against the stem with wads of wet cotton wool and bound in place with tape. This technique resulted in a high proportion of infection in E. marginata (Chapter 4) without the need for underbark inoculation or the use of zoospores (Chapter 3). It was successfully used in a large field trial in a rehabilitated bauxite mine site with 2-year-old E. marginata clonal plants, resistant to P. cinnamomi (Chapter 5). Inoculation was in late spring after the winter and spring rainfall.  This timing was to allow comparison of disease development in stressed plants under normal droughted summer conditions compared with itsdevelopment in non-stressed, irrigated plants. However, two months after inoculation, the area was deluged with unseasonal and abnormally heavy summer rainfall, negating any difference in the treatments and causing an outbreak of P. cinnamomi in the soil from an adjacent infested site. This resulted in the infection and death of some noninoculated control clones. 
 
 Monitoring of the site continued for twelve months and the advance of P. cinnamomi at the site was mapped. To test the effect of drought on the expression of P. cinnamomi under more controlled conditions, a series of glasshouse experiments was set up that simulated two possible summer conditions; drought or drought followed by abnormally high summer rainfall. These experiments utilised E. marginata seedlings and clonal plants, some resistant and some susceptible to P. cinnamomi. Plants were inoculated with P. cinnamomi prior to or after droughting. Results were compared to those of control plants that had not experienced water deficit. In both seedlings and clonal plants, the greatest extent of colonization was found in plants which had experienced no water deficit. These results indicated that drought stress played a role in inhibiting the in planta development of P. cinnamomi in all genotypes (Chapter 8). This finding was consistent for both clones, susceptible and resistant to P. cinnamomi. Most recoveries were made from non-stressed clonal plants, resistant to P. cinnamomi (Chapter 6) and more colonization was found in non-stressed clonal plants, susceptible to P. cinnamomi (Chapter 7), than was recorded for droughted plants.
 
 The results of the field trial showed that P. cinnamomi was not recovered from some inoculated stems, which had obvious lesions, when segments were plated onto selective agar. This led to an intensive in vitro investigation into improved methods of recovery. Dark brown exudates from some segments of inoculated stems stained the surrounding agar onto which they were plated, suggesting the presence of phenolic compounds. Recovery of the pathogen from stems increased by about 10% when segments were first soaked in distilled water to leach out the phenolic compounds, then replated onto agar. Other recovery methods were also tested, including (1) baiting with Pimelea ferruginea leaves floated on the surface of water or soil filtrate, in which the infected stem segments were immersed and (2) the application of different light and temperature regimes. It was clearly shown that exudates from infected stems of field grown E. marginata inhibited the outgrowth of P. cinnamomi onto the agar. To counter the possible toxic effect that oxidized phenolics had on the growth of the P. cinnamomi, an antioxidant was added to the agar. P. cinnamomi was grown on media whichincorporated exudates from infected stems and different concentrations of ascorbic acid, with and without adjusted pH levels. There was a pronounced pH effect, with less growth on media with lower pH and no significant increase in growth of the mycelium with increased ascorbic acid concentration on pH adjusted agar (Chapter 9).
 
 The inhibitory effect of the exudates from the stem segments led to an investigation of the possibility that, if seedlings to be planted in the rehabilitation process could be pre-treated with phenolic compounds to render them more resistant, they may have an advantage when establishing in areas where there was a potential threat of P. cinnamomi. E. marginata seeds were germinated and the seedlings grown hydroponically in a constant temperature growth room. Different concentrations of synthetic catechol, a phenolic compound naturally occurring in E. marginata, were added to the nutrient solution. Roots remained immersed in the catechol solutions for three days, before being inoculated at the root tip with zoospores of P. cinnamomi. Roots in higher concentrations of catechol were less colonized than those in lower concentrations, indicating an increased resistance to the pathogen (Chapter 10). Further work is required to determine if seedlings treated before being planted in areas threatened by an outbreak of P. cinnamomi have a greater capacity for survival, and for how long the protection persists. 
 
 The improved recovery of P. cinnamomi from infected plants is important for accurate assessment of the spread of the disease in an area and for the subsequent implementation of management strategies of containment and control. An outbreak of P. cinnamomi can impact on the revegetation of rehabilitated mine sites and the aetiology of the pathogen in mine sites needs to be more fully understood. The interaction of plant defences with the invasive pathogen has been examined in a range of environments in the field, the glasshouse, in a hydroponics system and in vitro. The results indicate that summer droughting increases the resistance of E. marginata to P. cinnamomi. However, more work is required to understand the mechanisms involved. The study also indicates that clones of E. marginata, selected as resistant to P. cinnamomi, are not resistant under all conditions and that environmental interactions should be further investigated. Lastly, for effective management strategies to be implemented it is critical that the pathogen can be confidently isolated from plants. It was shown that exudates from infected hosts inhibit the recovery of P. cinnamomi. Recovery methods that can overcome these inhibitory compounds are required. The findings invite further research into the complexity of host-pathogen relationships.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/167/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Giardia and cryptosporidium infection in childcare centres in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Lymbery, Jennifer Ann Walters</field><field name="description">Giardia and Cryptospovidium are both recognised as important causes of infectious diarrhoea in children worldwide, and childcare centres have been shown to be a major site of infection. The incidence of infectious diarrhoea in children attending childcare centres has been estimated at between two to five times greater than in children cared for at home. Both Giardia and Cryptospovidium have a faecal-oral route of transmission that facilitates their spread in childcare environments, but can also be interrupted through the use of efficient hygiene protocols such as handwashing. Despite their importance as causes of infectious diarrhoea, there are no data on the prevalence or transmission dynamics of these parasites in Australian childcare centres.
 
 The present study was designed to determine the prevalence and incidence of both Giardia and Ciyptosporidium in children attending childcare centres in Perth,Western Australia. Data were collected on asymptomatic infection, seasonal trends, the transmission dynamics of the parasites and risk factors for infection. The second part of the study involved the development, implementation and evaluation of a health intervention package designed to interrupt the transmission of causative organisms of infectious diarrhoea in childcare centres. This intervention was based on appropriate and effective handwashing.
 
 Over a period of 23 months, 1 172 faecal samples were collected from non-toilet-trained children (n=306) attending 14 childcare centres in Perth, Western Australia. Where possible, family and contacts of infected children were also sampled to determine the dynamics of infection in the community. Information on syrnptomology of infections and risk factors for infection was obtained by the administration of a questionnaire to parents of all the children in the study.
 
 Over all the childcare centres in the study, 7.8% of children were positive for Giardia and 10.8% were positive for Cryptosporidiunz. Of these, 37.5% of the Giardia-positive children returned positive samples on two to four occasions, but not always consecutively, suggesting either continuous or repeated infection with the parasite. Only 12% of children who were Cryptosporidiurn-positive were infected for two consecutive months.
 
 The major findings of this study included a significant seasonal peak in the prevalence of both Giardia and Cryptosporidium, with 50% of Giardia and 73% of Cryptosporidiurn infections occurring during the autumn months of March, April and May, and a high proportion of asymptomatic Giardia infections (45%), compared with only 13.5% of asymptomatic Cryptosporidiurn infections.
 
 There was evidence for the transmission of both Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections to household contacts of infected children. Of the children who were found to be positive, faecal samples were also collected from 28 family members of those children with Giardia and from 14 family members of those with Cryptosporidiunz. Of these, 17.9% family members of the children with Giardia and 28.6% of family members of the Cryptosporidiuin children returned positive faecal samples. The only significant risk factor for Giardia infection was the number of adults living in the household, with infection more likely to occur in children who had a greater number of adults in the household. Significant risk factors for Clyptosporidium infection included the age of the child: the mean age of the positive children (20.6 months) was higher than in the negative children (16.6 months), and the length of time enrolled at the centre. Children who were positive had attended for a longer time than those who were negative (1 1.2 and 7.8 months respectively).
 
 These results have important implications for the control of infection with these organisms, both within and beyond childcare centres. Since these parasites can be readily transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier, the high percentage of asymptomatic cases in this study, particularly of Giardia, strengthens the argument for health interventions which are directed at interrupting the trailsmission of the parasite.
 
 A health intervention programme was developed that focused on handwashing procedures and was targeted at the carers, the children and the parents of the children in the centres. It was designed to be a low-cost programme both financially, and in the time and effort required to implement the programme within the childcare centre, to enhance compliance with the intervention. The success of the programme in changing the knowledge, attitudes and practices of carers was evaluated through a pre- and posttest questionnaire. This showed that the programme successfully improved the knowledge of the carers in the test centres in several important areas of infection control. These included knowledge about specific organisms causing infectious diarrhoea in childcare centres, transmission of these by asymptomatic individuals and increased knowledge about effective handwashing technique. Because it has been repeatedly shown that increased knowledge does not always translate into improved practices, and that interventions are not always successful in maintaining an improvement in the desired practices, a subjective evaluation was also performed. This was designed to determine how effective the intervention was perceived to be by the carers themselves, and whether they would continue to use the intervention over time. The results showed that the majority of the carers (&gt;88%) found the intervention appropriate and useful in teaching both the carers and the children within the centres, the importance of handwashing. Twelve months after the intervention had first been implemented, 57% of the centres in the study were still using the intervention at least once per month and a further 2996, while using it less than this, still continued to use it occasionally. This is important information, since an intervention can only be useful if it is actually being used.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/168/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring device for early warning signs of operator fatigue in open cut mines</field><field name="creator">Mabbott, Nicholas</field><field name="description">An investigation into technologies to detect impaired performance due to driver fatigue was undertaken. From this, a new forced-choice stimulus-reaction device was developed specifically to detect driver impairment in operators of haul trucks in open cut mines. The device was developed in conjunction with personnel from the mining industry to suit the harsh conditions of the mining environment. The technology was trialled in three open cut mines and in a driving simulator at Murdoch University in Western Australia. Data were collected on the performance of drivers and analysed to validate the technology. A significant positive correlation was found between measures of reduced operator reaction performance and measures of eye closure. It was found that the device detected few false alarms and missed few bouts of tiredness as indicated by eye closures. It is suggested that the device would be a useful tool to assist with the detection of driver fatigue in open cut mining environments.  
 
 The forced-choice reaction-monitoring device was used to assess the performance of drivers in a gold mine in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The fly-in-fly-out haul truck drivers worked 14 consecutive 12-hour night shifts, had a day off, then worked 13 consecutive 12-hour day shifts. A total of more than 3,500 hours of real-time objective performance data were collected and analysed. The main findings were that the objective performance data showed patterns of low performance that did not fit some of the performance data that would be expected from examination of past literature. Many findings are discussed in light of these anomalies. Another important finding is that the subject's background and sleep pathology is a possible predictor for poor performance on the forced-choice reaction task. 
 
 The system was also used to measure the performance of drivers with rising blood alcohol levels in a driving simulator. Subjects drank vodka with a mixer while driving for two hours starting at both 20:00 hrs and 22:00 hrs, with a week in between the two trials. The fatigue monitor detected reaction times slower than 3 SD of baseline performance at low levels of BAC. Performance at 22:00 hrs was marginally more impaired than performance at 20:00 hrs. Drivers at low BAC levels tended to compensate easier on the reaction task at 20:00 hrs compared to at 22:00 hrs. The ARRB fatigue monitor shows good capacity to detect poor performance due to low and medium measures of BAC. 
 
 The research undertaken within this thesis has provided data that challenges contemporary research that generally suggests that time on task is one of the largest influences of fatigue at work. It appears that both circadian influences and individual lifestyle habits will have an equal or greater impact on fatigue risk at work.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/169/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'Emperor's new clothes': the role of the Western Australian press and state government in selling the story of the Northbridge curfew</field><field name="creator">Mac Arthur, Karin</field><field name="description">The Northbridge curfew is one of the stand-out success stories of Western Australia's Labor Government.  Introduced in June 2003 in an alleged bid to make the streets safer, the Northbridge curfew has enjoyed overwhelming popular support and consistently high recognition in public opinion polls.  This is despite the fact that the curfew bypasses those known to be responsible for most of the crime in the precinct (white males aged 18 to 35 years), targeting instead young people aged under 18 and affecting indigenous girls in particular.  The curfew did not introduce any legislative changes (the police already had the powers under the Child Welfare Act 1947 to apprehend young people); neither did it allocate any additional resources to the organisations working with young people in Northbridge.  Yet the coverage of the curfew in the WA press implied that indigenous youth presented a serious problem in Perth's premier entertainment district and that the State Government was doing something about it.
 
 This thesis uses a framing analysis of the press coverage of the Northbridge curfew as well as interviews with the relevant journalists and government media advisers to demonstrate how news values, work routines and political imperatives encouraged the WA press and State Government to work together in creating a 'fable' about Northbridge that criminalised indigenous youth.  I argue that the story of the Northbridge curfew, like the 'Emperor's new clothes', presents a deliberate distortion of reality and that the various stages of its development illuminate the processes by which media and government can collaborate to manipulate public opinion.
 
 I draw on my research findings to present recommendations designed, first, to encourage media professionals to develop a range of sources beyond government and, second, to draw the attention of the State Government to the broader ramifications of the Northbridge curfew story for all members of the Western Australian community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/170/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Edge effects and birds across karri forest (Eucalyptus diversicolor) clear-fell edges: a study of theory and conservation management</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Penelope Ingrid</field><field name="description">Theoretical and empirical studies on logging impacts internationally indicate that edges between mature forest and regrowth may alter the abundance and distribution of fauna, with implications for biodiversity conservation. The south-west Western Australian karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forest bird community is characterised by high degrees of endemism, cooperative breeding and reliance on nest hollows. It may therefore show different responses to clearfelled edges than bird communities in Northern Hemisphere forests, where most edge studies have been carried out.
 
 The term Edge Effect was originally defined specifically as an increase in abundance and diversity at the edge but has since been used indiscriminately to describe any change in distribution across an edge, confusing any assessment of the types and prevalence of these changes. For clarity, in this thesis the term Edge Response was used to describe the response of a community, guild or species to edges, and the term Edge Effect restricted to its original definition. I surveyed the international literature to determine the types and prevalence of community level changes in bird distribution across edges. Edge Effects at the community level are not common internationally, while there are many other documented types of edge response. Foraging or functional guilds can differ in their edge responses, and at the species level, edge responses have been demonstrated to differ between habitats for the same species, and may also change seasonally.
 
 Therefore, I monitored the distribution of birds at the Community, Guild and Species levels across replicated clear-fell edges (120m and 60m into regrowth, at  the edge and 60m into mature forest) between mature forest and 1) Establishment regrowth, 2) Juvenile regrowth and 3) mature forest (control, no edge) in three karri forest areas over four seasons (one year), and one forest area over eight seasons (two IV years). A five minute count of birds within each 30m radius circular plot was repeated approximately five times each season (108 plots in the first year, 36 plots over two years). Mean values of abundance (for the whole bird community and for individual species) and diversity measures for each census point were calculated and analysed with repeated measures ANOVA. Bird behavioural and vegetation data and Mist-netting captures across edges were also investigated. 
 
 My aims were to 1) describe and quantify any edge-related changes in the distribution and abundance of the birds 2) suggest possible explanations for the patterns observed and 3) propose management actions to minimise negative impacts.
 
 There was no Community Edge Effect. The bird community as a whole did not respond to edges themselves, but was most abundant where mature forest was present (including at edges), least abundant and diverse in Establishment regrowth and intermediate in abundance and diversity in Juvenile regrowth. Guilds were poor predictors of species edge responses. Only the Nectarivores showed a unified response to edges - all five species avoided regrowth and four species avoided Juvenile edges. The Granivore/Frugivore guild and the whole Insectivore guild were less abundant in regrowth than in mature forest but did not have higher or lower abundance at the edge. Insectivorous species' edge responses were diverse and not reliably attributed to foraging-strata guilds (Understorey; Shrub; Canopy; All-Levels; Aerial; Bark). The Tree Martin, an Aerial foraging insectivore, showed an Edge Effect at Establishment edges in the first year of the study only. Individual vegetation variables were poor predictors of bird species distributions but overall, floristics changed with forest area not with edge distance, while habitat structural variables varied with edge, forest age and distance from the edge indicating that overall, structural variables were most strongly related to bird edge responses. The proportion of trees of 10-24cm diameterwas highest at Juvenile edges, which were avoided by four Nectarivore species and the bark-foraging Rufous Treecreeper.
 
 Ordination grouped bird species by six edge response categories - Avoid edges; Prefer edges; Prefer Mature-forest; Prefer Mature-forest/Juvenile-regrowth; Prefer Establishment-regrowth; Neutral. However for individual species, these edge responses changed both temporally and spatially, emphasising the need for edge studies to be well replicated in both time and space. Some bird species  also showed behavioural changes across edges. Species potentially disadvantaged by the creation of clear-fell edges are those avoiding Juvenile edges (Purple-crowned Lorikeet, New Holland Honeyeater, White-naped Honeyeater, Little Wattlebird and Rufous Treecreeper), and those most abundant in Mature forest habitat, but which show great spatial variation in abundance and therefore have unclear responses to edges (Whitebrowed Babbler, Restless Flycatcher). Several management options to ameliorate the effects of edge creation within production forest areas for these species will be discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/171/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocean cruising: a study of affirmative deviance</field><field name="creator">Macbeth, James</field><field name="description">Modern day ocean voyaging in private sailing vessels dates back to the turn of the century. Despite this, the present thesis is the first academic study of ocean cruising to be completed. of the thousands of people who make ocean voyages only a few hundred arecommitted to the lifestyle of cruising, that is, see cruising as a whole way of life that they will pursue indefinitely. The thesis first presents an ethnography of the lifstyle of cruising with particular attention to (1) what activities constitute the lifestyle, (2) why people cruise, and (3) what values, attitudes, and characteristics attach to the participants. Second, the thesis relates this ethnography to several theories in socialogy and psychology.
 
 In sociology, subculture and deviance theories are used to place cruising in the context of the wider scholastic study of society. Pearson (1979) and others are drawn upon in placing crusing in the context of subcultures while the work of walter Buckley (1967) is used to modify deviance theory to account for the apparently positive nature of the deviance inherent in the cruising lifestyle.
 
 In psychology, theories of autotelic rewards, enjoyment, and human satisfaction are used to understand the experience of and motivation to cruise. In addition, theories of personal growth developed by Hampden-Turner (1970) and others are applied to cruisers and their way of life.
 
 The thesis concludes that cruisers, as cultural 'heroes', can be seen as affirmative deviants. That is to say, given an humanistic and western individualistic value system their deviance can be seen as contributing to their individual health and growth, and to positive social evolution.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/172/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the benzimidazole-binding site on the cytoskeletal protein tubulin</field><field name="creator">MacDonald, Louisa M.</field><field name="description">The binding kinetics of several benzimidazole compounds were determined with recombinant tubulin monomers and heterodimers from benzimidazole-sensitive and -insensitive organisms. This study utilised the naturally occurring high efficacy of the benzimdazoles for the parasitic protozoa Giardia duodenalis and Encephalitozoon intestinalis. The benzimidazoles are not active against the protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum or mammalian hosts, including humans. The affinity of several benzimidazole derivatives for monomeric and heterodimeric beta-tubulin was clearly demonstrated, thus supporting previous studies of drug-resistant nematode and fungal populations. A homology model of protozoan alpha beta-tubulin, produced using the three-dimensionalstructure of mammalian alpha beta-tubulin, identified a strongly hydrophobic domain only on the beta-tubulin protein of sensitive protozoa. This domain is proposed to be the benzimidazole-binding domain and the amino acid residues within it include three key residues which are substituted between benzimidazole-sensitive and -insensitive organisms. These residues are Ile-189, Val-199, and Phe-200 that all have non-polar, hydrophobic side groups and are proposed to bind with the R5 side chain of several benzimidazole derivatives. In addition to this, the benzimidazole derivatives were able to bind irreversibly with assembling microtubules from sensitive parasites. The incorporation of benzimidazole-bound alpha beta-heterodimers into assembling microtubules was shown to arrest polymerisation in vitro although the addition of benzimidazole compounds to assembled microtubules did not result in depolymerisation. Taken together, these results suggest that the mechanism of action of these compounds is through disruption of the dynamic equilibrium that balances the cycle of microtubule polymerisation and disintegration within these protozoa.

 The haematocrit (46.2%), red blood cell number (1.231 X 106 cells mm-3) and haemoglobin concentration (11.8g 100ml-l) of adult G. australis are more typical of comparable stages in holarctic lampreys than those of their ammocoetes (41.5%, 1.809 106 cells mm-3, 11.1 g 100 ml-1). During metamorphosis, the pattern of change in haemopoietic sites, haemoglobin electropherograms and the proportion of mature erythrocytes, indicate that erythrocytes containing larval and adult haemoglobins always originate in different structures.  The molecular weights (c 17000) and pI values (5.1-6.4) of G. australis haemoglobins are similar to those of other lampreys.  The P50 of larval blood is very low, while that of adult blood is more comparable to that of other lampreys (cf. 0.92 mm Hg for ammocoete and 10.3 mm Hg for adult at pH 7.75 and 15oC). Increases in temperature do not affect the Bohr shift (range -0.16 to -0.27) but are accompanied by a shift of the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. 
 
 The major plasma iron binding proteins have molecular weights of 354,000 in the ammocoete and 296,000 in the adult and contain 20 and 4 subunits respectively.  The larval IBP is thus ferritin-like while that of the adult is transferring-like, features consistent with their respective pI values, Fe/protein ratios and ultrastructure.  Total plasma iron was 19,760 ug 100 ml-1 in larvae and 34 ug 100 ml-1 in adults. Iron granules were present in the columnar cells of the posterior intestine in small or negligible amounts in the Petromyzonidae and in very large amounts in the Mordaciidea.  While some iron was found in the same location in the Geotriidae, it was also present in very large concentrations elsewhere in the body.  
 
 The high haemoglobin concentration and blood iron levels, and the large iron deposits and the low P50 in larval G. australis, probably represent adaptations to reduced environmental oxygen tensions.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/174/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sandpit dilemmas: challenges of researching young children</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Gaye</field><field name="description">In the past twenty years there has been a movement against the tradition of positivist, scientific research that treats children as the 'object' of research. This movement has been led by the sociology of childhood literature but also has supporters in disciplines such as developmental psychology and early childhood studies. Research within this new paradigm often seeks to gain the perspectives and lived experiences of children, giving them a voice through naturalistic methodologies such as ethnography and informal interviews. However, giving children a 'voice' has not been purely an academic endeavour. Supported by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990) which stipulates that States should assure that children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them, there is a push at all levels of government for children to be given a chance to express their views on issues that concern them. In Australia and overseas, the consulting of children on issues that concern them has become more commonplace. Thus in both research and policy development, methodologies which enable adults to get closer to the world of the child and to hear their views are being explored.
 
 This thesis explores some of the issues involved in this form of qualitative research with children. It does so through combining theoretical exposition and systematic reflection with the author's own empirical research which sought to gain an understanding of young children's views of 'difference' through an ethnographic methodology.
 
 Part One provides the theoretical base for the thesis, by exploring how 'the child' and childhood have been conceptualised within western thought. Drawing on the sociology of childhood, it also probes a number of the implications of this tradition and examines how it has shaped research on children both in terms of the methods that have been employed and the topics that have been of interest.
 
 Both chapters in Part Two focus on the empirical component of the study. The first is an extended methodology chapter which explores not only the method employed and the research setting but also some of the challenges that the author faced in the field and a discussion of issues such as ethics and the status of the researcher. Using logs of the children?s activities and the author's field journal, the next chapter explores how the initial research question altered and the issues that came to the fore during the research.
 
 Part Three reconsiders a number of the theoretical issues raised in Part One in light of the fieldwork discussed in Part Two. It asks how certain ethnographic studies, claiming affiliation with the sociology of childhood, nevertheless ended up with depictions of children not far from the positivistic studies their authors had critiqued. It argues that this can be explained by the persistence of a 'problem centred' adultcentric frame which privileges understanding of a particular issue (e.g. the development of racism in children) over the actual experiences of individual children. Given the renewed interest in consulting children this proposition has practical as well as theoretical significance as it reveals how easy it is for slippage to occur and the importance of preventing it.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/175/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of community-derived Hymenolepis infections in Australia</field><field name="creator">Macnish, Marion</field><field name="description">Hymenolepis nana is a ubiquitous parasite, found throughout many developing and developed countries. Globally, the prevalence of H. nana is alarmingly high, with estimates of up to 75 million people infected. In Australia, the rates of infection have increased substantially in the last decade, from less than 20% in the early 1990's to 55 - 60% in these same communities today. Our knowledge of the epidemiology of infection of H. nana is hampered by the confusion surrounding the host specificity and taxonomy of this parasite. The suggestion of the existence of two separate species, Hymenolepis nana von Siebold 1852 and Hymenolepis fraterna Stiles 1906, was first proposed at the beginning of the 20th century. Despite ongoing discussions in the subsequent years it remained unclear, some 90 years later, whether there were two distinct species, that are highly host specific, or whether they were simply the same species present in both rodent and human hosts. The ongoing controversy surrounding the taxonomy of H. nana has not yet been resolved and remains a point of difference between the taxonomic and medical literature.
 
 The epidemiology of infection with H. nana in Australian communities is not well understood as the species present in these communities has never been identified with certainty. It is not clear which form of transmission commonly occurs in Australia, whether the H. nana 'strain/species' present in the north-west of Western Australia is present in human and rodent hosts, or whether humans harbour their own 'strain/sub-species' of Hymenolepis. Furthermore, it is not known whether mice are a potential zoonotic source for transmission of Hymenolepis to human hosts. In this study, 51 human isolates of H. nana were inoculated into highly susceptible laboratory rodent species. However, these failed to develop into adult worms in all instances, including when rodent species were chemically and genetically immunosuppressed. In addition, 24 of these human isolates were also cross-tested in the flour beetle intermediate host, Tribolium confusum. Of these, only one isolate developed to the cysticercoid stage in beetles, yet when inoculated into laboratory rodents, the cysticercoids also failed to develop into adult stage.
 
 Since isolates of H. nana infecting humans and rodents are morphologically indistinguishable, the only way they can be reliably identified is by comparing the parasite in each host using molecular criteria. In the current study, three regions of ribosomal DNA, the small subunit (18S), the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) and the intergenic spacer (IGS) were chosen for genetic characterisation of Hymenolepis spp. from rodent and human hosts from a broad geographic range. In addition, a mitochondrial gene, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (C01) gene and a non-ribosomal nuclear gene, paramyosin, were characterised in a number of Hymenolepis isolates from different hosts. 
 
 A small PCR fragment of 369 bp, plus a larger fragment of 1223 bp, were sequenced from the 18S gene of reference isolates of H. nana and the rat tapeworm H. diminuta. Minimal sequence variation was found in the two regions of the 18S between these two morphologically distinct, phylogenetically recognised species, H. nana and H. diminuta, and this indicated that the 18S gene was too conserved for further genetic characterisation of isolates of H. nana from different hosts.
 
 A large number of human isolates of H. nana (104) were characterised at the ITS1 using PCRrestriction length fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The profiles obtained were highly variable and often exceeded the original size of the uncut fragment. This was highly suggestive of the existence of ribosomal spacers that, whilst identical in length, were highly variable in sequence. To overcome the problems of the variable PCR-RFLP profiles, further characterisation of the ITS1, by cloning and sequencing 23 isolates of H. nana, was conducted and this confirmed the existence of spacers which, although similar in length (approximately 646 bp), differed in their primary sequences. The sequence differences led to the separation of the isolates into two clusters when analysed phylogenetically. This sequence variation was not, however, related to the host of origin of the isolate, thus was not a marker of genetic distinction between H. nana from rodents and humans. Indeed, the levels of variability were often higher within an individual isolate than between isolates, regardless of whether they were collected from human or mice hosts, which was problematic for phylogenetic analysis. In addition, mixed parasite infections of H. nana and the rodent tapeworm H. microstoma were identified in four humans in this study, which was unexpected and surprising, as there have been no previous reports in the literature documenting humans as definitive hosts for this parasite. Further studies are required, however, to determine if the detection of H. microstoma in humans reflects a genuine, patent infection or an atypical, accidental occurrence. 
 
 Sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene (C01) in a number of isolates of Hymenolepis nana from rodents and humans identified a phylogenetically supported genetic divergence of approximately 5% between some mouse isolates compared to isolates of H. nana from humans. This provided evidence that the mitochondrial C01 gene was useful for identifying genetic divergences in H. nana that were not resolvable using nuclear loci. Despite a morphological identity between isolates of H. nana from rodent and human hosts, the genetic divergence observed between isolates at the mitochondrial locus was highly suggestive that H. nana is a species complex, or 'cryptic' species (= morphologically identical yet genetically distinct). In addition, whilst not supported by high bootstrap values, a clustering of the Australian human isolates into one uniform genetic group that was phylogenetically separated from all the mouse isolates was well supported by biological data obtained in this study. To confirm the phylogeny of the C01 tree a small segment of the nuclear gene, paramyosin, was sequenced in a number of isolates from humans and rodents. However, this gene did not provide the level of heterogeneity required to distinguish between isolates from rodent and human hosts. The high sequence conservation of the paramyosin gene characterised in this study did not refute the finding that H. nana may be a cryptic species that is becoming host adapted. It simply did not provide additional data to that already obtained. 
 
 A DNA fingerprinting tool, PCR-RFLP, of the ribosomal intergenic spacer (IGS), was developed in this study in order to evaluate its usefulness in tracing particular genotypes within a community, thus determining transmission patterns of H. nana between rodent and human hosts. Analysis of the IGS of numerous H. nana isolates by PCR-RFLP identified the presence of copies of the IGS that, whilst similar in length, differed in their sequence. Similar to that observed in the ITS1, the existence of different IGS copies was found in both rodent and human isolates of H. nana, thus the variability was not evidence of the existence of a rodent- or humanspecific genotype. Evaluation of the intergenic spacer (IGS) as a fingerprinting tool suggests that this region of DNA is too variable within individuals and thus, cannot be effectively used for the study of transmission patterns of the tapeworm H. nana between different hosts. 
 
 In summary, it appears that the life cycle of H. nana that exists in remote communities in the north-west of Western Australia is likely to involve mainly 'human to human' transmission. This is supported by both the biological and genetic data obtained for the mitochondrial locus in this study. The role of the intermediate hosts, such as Tribolium spp., in the Hymenolepis life cycle is still unclear, however it would appear that it may be greatly reduced in the transmission of this parasite in remote Australian communities. In the future, it is recommended that further genetic characterisation of faster evolving mitochondrial genes, and/or suitable nuclear genes be characterised in a larger number of isolates of H. nana. The use of techniques which can combine the characterisation of genotype and phenotype, such as proteomics, may also be highly valuable for studies on H. nana from different hosts.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/176/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assisting reading and analysis of text documents by visualization</field><field name="creator">Maloney, Ross J.</field><field name="description">The research reported here examined the use of computer generated graphics as a means to assist humans to analyse text documents which have not been subject to markup. The approach taken was to survey available visualization techniques in a broad selection of disciplines including applications to text documents, group those techniques using a taxonomy proposed in this research, then develop a selection of techniques that assist the text analysis objective. Development of the selected techniques from their fundamental basis, through their visualization, to their demonstration in application, comprises most of the body of this research. A scientific orientation employing measurements, combined with visual depiction and explanation of the technique with limited mathematics, is used as opposed to fully utilising any one of those resulting techniques for performing complete text document analysis. 
 
 Visualization techniques which apply directly to the text and those which exploit measurements produced by associated techniques are considered. Both approaches employ visualization to assist the human viewer to discover patterns which are then used in the analysis of the document. In the measurement case, this requires consideration of data with dimensions greater than three, which imposes a visualization difficulty. Several techniques for overcoming this problem are proposed. Word frequencies, Zipf considerations, parallel coordinates, colour maps, Cusum plots, and fractal dimensions are some of the techniques considered. 
 
 One direct application of visualization to text documents is to assist reading of that document by de-emphasising selected words by fading them on the display from which they are read. Three word selection techniques are proposed for the automatic selection of which words to use.
 
 An experiment is reported which used such word fading techniques. It indicated that some readers do have improved reading speed under such conditions, but others do not. The experimental design enabled the separation of that group which did decrease reading times from the remaining readers who did not. Measurement of comprehension errors made under different types of word fading were shown not to increase beyond that obtained under normal reading conditions. 
 
 A visualization based on categorising the words in a text document is proposed which contrasts to visualization of measurements based on counts. The result is a visual impression of the word composition, and the evolution of that composition within that document.
 
 The text documents used to demonstrates these techniques include English novels and short stories, emails, and a series of eighteenth century newspaper articles known as the Federalist Papers. This range of documents was needed because all analysis techniques are not applicable to all types of documents. This research proposes that an interactive use of the techniques on hand in a non-prescribed order can yield useful results in a document analysis. An example of this is in author attribution, i.e. assigning authorship of documents via patterns characteristic of an individual's writing style. Different visual techniques can be used to explore the patterns of writing in given text documents. 
 
 A software toolkit as a platform for implementing the proposed interactive analysis of text documents is described. How the techniques could be integrated into such a toolkit is outlined. A prototype of software to implement such a toolkit is included in this research. Issues relating to implementation of each technique used are also outlined.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/177/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transpersonal literature</field><field name="creator">Marrable, Joseph</field><field name="description">What do you get if you apply Ken Wilber's theories of transpersonal psychological development within human consciousness to William Golding's Lord of the Flies or Conrad's Heart of Darkness, or Shakespeare's Hamlet? Can they provide a clear interpretative tool in order to uncover the intentional or unintentional aspects of consciousness development contained within them? Do these literary texts reveal a coherent quest for knowledge of human consciousness, the nature of good and evil, and the ineffable question of spirit? Is there a case for presenting a transpersonal perspective of literature in order to expound the theories of this psychological discipline? Can literary texts provide materials that are unique to that art form and can be explicated by knowledge of transpersonal psychology? Is there an evolutionary motion, which is not necessarily historically chronological but nonetheless displays a developmental map of human consciousness across literary works? In other words, can we see a hierarchical framework along the lines of consciousness development as proposed by Ken Wilber, that suggests a movement up the evolutionary ladder of consciousness from Lord of the Flies to Hamlet and beyond? Can we counter oppose Lord of the Flies and Hamlet, suggesting that the first is a fable of regression to transpersonal evil within a cultural community and the second sees Hamlet attempt to avoid this path in order to move toward the transcendence of ego and self, within the individual? If this is so then we should be able to plot both paths relative to the models of development traced in Wilber's theories and interpret the texts according to this framework. What is the relationship between transpersonal aspects of consciousness and literature? And what are the effects upon the cultural consciousness of human evolution that literature has had so much to inform? How do the literary works of individuals inform the cultural consciousness and transcend the age in which they are written? Equally we should be able to test the theories with the aid of some texts of literature - especially those works which are of, and about consciousness. What does this mean to the literary interpretation of these texts? How does it differ from other interpretations? What are the pitfalls and what disclaimers need to be put in place?

However, greywater reuse from domestic houses appears to have received very little attention and the role of indigenous wetland plants, especially submergents, in contributing to nutrient reduction in wastewater is largely unknown.
 
 Species of Triglochin, commonly known as water ribbons, are fast growing submergent macrophytes. In Western Australia, Triglochin huegelii is mainly a submergent plant but as water recedes, the leaves become emergent. Triglochin huegelii can tolerate a range of water regimes and high nutrient concentrations, and this is useful in wastewater treatment applications. The aims of this present study were to examine the use of Triglochin huegelii for domestic greywater treatment, to compare the effectiveness of this plant with other better known, and more frequently used, emergent macrophytes, and to investigate why Triglochin huegelii is so successful in nutrient accumulation.
 
 A series of investigations using Triglochin huegelii in greywater treatment experiments showed that Triglochin has consistently removed more nitrogen and phosphorus, in all parts of the plant - leaves, tubers and roots, than most other indigenous emergent macrophyte species, including those of Schoenoplectus, Baumea and Juncus which are commonly used for wastewater nutrient-stripping. In some cases, such as in the leaves, twice as much nitrogen (N) and one and a half times more phosphorus (P) is assimilated in the Triglochin tissue. In all parts of the plant there has been an increase in Total N and Total P.
 
 Investigations were conducted using different environmental conditions for the plants. A comparison was made between root zone (substrate-only) and complete pond conditions, with some changes to loading rate and retention times. Triglochin huegelii has many practical applications in wastewater management, especially if the level of influentlwastewater can be controlled, thus allowing sufficient time for Triglochin huegelii to respond with changed structure and morphology. Proline, a substance known to be produced by plants under stress (such as changing water levels), was detected in Triglochin huegelii.
 
 In a pond, the leaves of Triglochin can be directly involved in nutrient absorption and assimilation. A study of leaf structure and other aspects of its biology showed that nutrients can easily pass into leaf tissue and then into other regions in the plant. In Triglochin huegelii, nitrogen was primarily stored or found in leaves then tubers then roots, while levels of phosphorus 
 were higher in tubers then roots then leaves.
 
 The above-ground:below-ground (AG:BG) ratio of Triglochin huegelii also depends on the water regime. For all samples, whether pond or substrateonly, the ratio was 0.84. However, when consideration is given to pond conditions the ratio increases to 1.11. It appears that in pond conditions, and especially with long retention times, proportionally more above-ground growth (leaves) occurs and in substrate-only conditions, proportionally more biomass is found below-ground, with the number and size of leaves reduced in these plants.
 
 The highest nutrient levels recorded for Triglochin huegelii were 11.74 mgP/g and 35.7 mgN/g dry weight. Triglochin huegelii has been found to have a protein content of at least 1.7 g/100 g wet weight in the leaves, and less in roots and tubers. Triglochin huegelii could have potential as a fodder source because of its high protein content, similar to that of lucerne.
 
 Triglochin huegelii seems to remove nitrogen and phosphorus at a greater rate than many other types of aquatic macrophytes. Other parameters such as BOD, Suspended Solids and fecal coliforms were also examined, with reductions of up to 90%, 84% and 99% respectively. The implication is that instead of only planting the perimeter of lagoons, artificial wetlands and constructed basins we should be planting the bulk of the waterway with submergent species such as Triglochin spp which are far more effective in stripping nutrients than emergents currently used for that purpose. In addition, systems need to be designed that mimic natural ecosystems, and yet are economical and functional.
 
 This current research can be used as a basis for further study to establish the extent of nutrient removal by Triglochin huegelii and its interactions with other macrophytes in polyculture systems.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/180/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary genetics of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in the Australian region</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Carina Rynn Ecremen</field><field name="description">Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is a centropomid teleost with a wide distribution across the Indo Pacific. In Australia, barramundi are native to the tropical zone from Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia, across the northern part of the continent, to the Mary River in Queensland. Barramundi are protandrous hermaphrodites, and are euryhaline, with a catadromous life history. Barramundi are a valuable Australian resource, with important commercial and recreational fisheries and aquaculture production to the value of $11 million dollars per year. Recent declines in the availability of the fish in some rivers has led to an interest in the possibility of restocking rivers with barramundi from other areas.
 
 Determining the genetic structure of barramundi populations in Australia is important for understanding biogeographic history, and appropriate management practices for both aquaculture and recreational and commercial fishing. Previous studies have concentrated on the east coast of Australia, and have largely ignored the western populations. In this study, I obtained DNA data from barramundi populations across the Australian range of the species, as well as populations from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The aims of this study were to use the genetic data to determine: 1. if populations in Western Australia show genetic differences between geographic regions 2. if these populations show an ancestral split from populations in the east of Australia and 3. the ancestral origins of Australian barramundi.
 
 Previous studies of DNA data from barramundi have discovered an east/west split occurring at the Torres Strait that was assumed to be caused by the closing of the strait during lowered sea levels. However, these studies suffered from a bias in sampling area, concentrating either on the eastern half of the range of barramundi, or on the western tip of the range. Data from these studies were combined and reanalyzed. Two major clades were discovered, with considerable biogeographic structuring, but their geographic locations did not coincide with the reported vicariance event at the Torres Strait. Instead,historical divisions among freshwater drainage systems appeared to have driven the evolutionary history of barramundi in Australia.
 
 In order to investigate these historical divisions further, a 290 bp section of the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced in 284 barramundi from seven populations across the Australian geographic range of the species and from one population in Papua New Guinea and one population in Indonesia. Analyses of molecular variance within and among populations showed significant geographic structuring, based on biogeographical provinces and drainage divisions. Nested clade analyses indicated that these geographical associations were the result of restricted gene flow, range expansion, and past fragmentation events. I hypothesise that the Ord River area in the west of the continent was the ancestral source population for the rest of the species' range across Australia, with Indonesia being the most likely origin of this source. Populations of barramundi from the Pilbara region are genetically distinct and geographically isolated, with strong evidence of an ancestral divide along geographical barriers to dispersal. There is a strong association between Papua New Guinea and Australia, although further investigations using the cytochrome b region of mitochondrial DNA indicated a more ancestral divide between the two than is currently evident, which could reflect an ancient geographical divide between the two, or could be evidence of a secondary migration route to Australia.
 
 For a more detailed study of evolutionary processes acting on populations of barramundi in Western Australia, allelic diversity was examined at five microsatellite loci. All loci were polymorphic and genotypic frequencies conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, with no significant linkage between loci evident in any population. Measures of within population diversity were significantly related to latitude, suggesting southerly migration from a northern source population. The Ord River was the most genetically diverse population, and the most likely ancestral migration source to the area, with diversity decreasing down the west coast. Although there were significant differences among populations, the nuclear microsatellite data do not indicate the same degree of genetic structuring as is evident in the mitochondrial data. This may be a consequence of rapid evolutionary change at microsatellite loci, with past separations or population differences masked by recombination and back mutation of the microsatellite alleles. However, the nature of nuclear and mitochondrial inheritance may also indicate life history differences between the sexes, where significant genetic contribution to gene flow by males and limited female gene flow may lead to preservation of maternally inherited population substructure.
 
 The principal findings from this study are:
 * There is no genetic evidence for an east/west division of barramundi populations in Australia, as suggested by previous research.
 * Despite barramundi's catadromous life history, and ability to disperse through marine waters, the present genetic structure indicates a division principally among river drainages. From a population genetic viewpoint, the species can be regarded as freshwater, rather than marine.
 * The most likely origin of barramundi in Australia is the Ord River region, with Indonesia as the route of migration.
 * Differences in the population structure demonstrated by nuclear and mitochondrial data indicate possible life history differences between the sexes. 
 * Barramundi populations in different biogeographical provinces may have been substantially isolated over a long period of time, and may therefore represent independently evolving populations. This has important implications for fishery management and translocation issues for restocking rivers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/181/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student and teacher perceptions of preparation in mathematics in middle school and its impact on students' self-efficacy and performance in an upper secondary school in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Aurbrey, Ron</field><field name="description">Middle school initiatives (including heterogeneous classes and an integrated, flexible curriculum together with promotion of student input) have been implemented in schools in Western Australia in response to a perceived need to align schools more closely with a more student-centred approach to learning, in the expectation of meeting more students' needs and thereby reducing student dissatisfaction and increasing the possibility of students pursuing life long learning. Specific goals underlying the initiative include the development of independent learning and student responsibility for learning through a series of strategies such as self-paced learning, student involvement in negotiating their own learning, and a strong emphasis on respecting and valuing student input into the implementation of curricula. However, owing to the way that the curricula for Middle and Upper secondary school mathematics are currently structured, problems might arise for students in the transition from a relaxed to a highly discipline-based organization of content (as described by Venville, Wallace, Rennie, Malone (1998). Students accustomed to the current approaches implemented in Middle schools (Years 8 to 10) may be disadvantaged in the transition to Upper secondary school courses (Years 11 and 12) compared with those students who have been exposed to a more discipline-based organization of content throughout early adolescence and prior to entry into courses leading to tertiary entrance (T.E.E. courses). The aim of this project was to investigate the possible effects of Middle school initiatives in a group of students from three Middle schools in Western Australia in one subject area - mathematics - on the perceptions of self-efficacy and preparation in mathematics once the students encounter Year 11 Upper school courses.
 
 A survey containing Likert-type rating scales pertinent to four areas of interest - Self-efficacy in mathematics; Self-Directed Regulation; Views on current teaching; and Views on prior teaching were administered to students transferring from three 'feeder' Middle schools to Year 11 (Upper secondary school) classes in one Senior College in Western Australia for each of 4 consecutive years. Students were also asked for their comments regarding preparation for the challenges of their chosen courses in mathematics. In addition, their levels of performance in a range of mathematical skills were assessed using a teacher-developed test. The perceptions of their Middle and Senior School teachers were also sought. As the survey was administered to all students as a routine part of action research within the mathematics faculty at the Senior College, only the results of those students who subsequently agreed to be participants in the study are reported in this dissertation. Results indicated that a mismatch existed in approaches and skills between Middle School and Senior College Mathematics. The reliance on students making suitable choices for themselves, the absence of specialist teachers of mathematics in middle schools, mixed ability classes in which specialist teachers of mathematics find it difficult to operate successfully and a curriculum that was so flexible that teachers omitted key elements required for later studies were the main factors that resulted in a significant number of students making the transition from middle to senior school with insufficient preparation. Implications for the teaching of mathematics in these three Middle schools and the Upper school are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/182/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jesus and the banquets: an investigation of the early Christian tradition concerning Jesus' presence at banquets with toll collectors and sinners</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Mary Jeanette</field><field name="description">The topic is approached from the perspective of table fellowship, the primary focus being Jesus' commensality with toll collectors and sinners. The fundamental hypothesis is that Jesus typically arrived akletos at meals as an itinerant stranger, and that this explains the epithet glutton and drunkard.
 
 Part One sets the parameters, and delineates the materials, methods, and approach adopted in the study. In Part Two, ancient traditions of hospitality and feasting are examined, providing the background material for exegesis of relevant NT texts in Part Three.
 
 It is found that toll collectors represent hosts to Jesus, while sinners gain entry to meals as his umbrae. Both groups are eligible for the kingdom, as are paidia (young slaves/servants), who exemplify humility. Some possible reasons are advanced for Jesus' criticism of Pharisees, but it is emphasised that they are not implicated in his death. The importance of hospitality is indicated by the fact that reception of Jesus and/or his disciples necessarily entails an invitation to a shared meal. In contrast, merely giving alms to strangers/wayfarers who seek hospitality signifies rejection. Any such breach of hospitality mores will incur harsh punishment at the final judgment.
 
 The supposition that Jesus was a guest at the Last Supper allows for an innovative interpretation of his words and actions, particularly since it is proposed that as well as the Twelve, akletoi were present, viz. women, slaves/servants, and possibly Gentiles. It is suggested that the depiction of Jesus in the Synoptics may have been influenced by a pre-existing literary archetype that facilitated the combination of some fictional characteristics with historical elements. The proposed reconstruction of the historical Jesus demonstrates the centrality of hospitality, commensality, and humility in his teaching and practice, a finding that is consistent with the ideals and table fellowship of early Christian communities. The apparent dichotomy between hospitality and hostility indicates a need to follow Jesus' injunction to love one's enemies, i.e. to practise philoxenia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/183/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community participation in government and private sector planning: a case study of health and telecommunications planning for rural and remote Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Martini, Angelita</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in the context of health service planning in an environment of changing government strategies for regional, rural and remote area health care and telecommunications infrastructure planning in Western Australia. The study provides an account of the State Government of Western Australia's planning for the implementation of a telecommunications network infrastructure, and specifically the Telehealth Project, conducted between 1998 and 2002.
 
 The purpose of this study was to examine influences on community participation in planning within the dynamic political, economic and social forces that impact on the development of regional, rural and remote area health services. Specifically, the study outlines the issues and barriers in providing for significant local participation in projects that are centrally initiated and controlled. It examines the influences in planning for projects that incorporate local community based beliefs and needs, the requirements of collaborating with multiple state and national government departments, and the private sector.
 
 This study was situated within the interpretive paradigm, and is conceptualised within Donabedian's (1969) framework for assessing and assuring quality in health care. The methodological approach is bound within a case study and consists of a participatory action research approach. The research method uses the single case to undertake in-depth interviews, observations and a survey to collect data from community, government and industry members as a basis for reflection and action.
 
 The findings of the study clearly indicated that there was consensus between all rural, remote and metropolitan area participants that telecommunications did offer the opportunity to provide increased, improved or alternative health services. However, there were a number of obstacles to the success of the planning process, including a lack of local community inclusion in planning committees, poor communication within central government agencies, overuse of external consultants, a bias toward the medical view, a limited scope of invitation to contribute, and local information being overlooked in the final implementation plan.
 
 Analysis of planning for the Telehealth Project reveals the implications of organisational and political stakeholders making final decisions about outcomes; and provides a reminder of the importance of engaging communities authentically when planning for health and telecommunications services which involve the public and private sectors.
 
 The originality and significance of this study stems from understanding how technology can advance community health; through measures such as the use of community participation strategies, through authentic community based leadership, truly representative participants, decentralised decision making, a focus on community based health needs and change management strategies that include all of these. Consequently, the study advances knowledge of community participation in planning and the evidence suggests implications for practice, education and further research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/184/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interrogating masculinities: regimes of practice</field><field name="creator">Martino, Wayne</field><field name="description">This thesis draws on post-Foucauldian theories of governmental power and technologies of the self to critically examine the deployment of post-structuralist, psychoanalytic, sociological and cultural studies' paradigms for theorising and researching masculinities. It is argued that a particular dialectical mode of rationality and a project of cultural completion inform these approaches which are based on a requirement to reconcile oppositional categories such as freedom and determination, subject-determining state and self-determining subject, social structure and social actor. The limits are outlined of theorising subjectivity in terms of the restoration of consciousness to the individual and as the means by which 'culture' is mediated via repressive andlor ideological mechanisms.
 
 An alternative theorisation of subjectivity, conceiving of masculinities as enacted within regimes of historically contingent nomalising practices, is applied to an investigation of how specific groups of boys learn to relate as gendered subjects in a particular school. Surveys, observational methods and semi-structured interviews are used to trace the specific effects of practices implicated in the formation of masculinities for the boys. Attention is also drawn to the relationship of specific models of masculinity to the boys' literacy practices.
 
 On the basis of this research, important implications for practice at policy and pedagogical levels are identified.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/185/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching Hatha yoga: an auto-ethnographic study</field><field name="creator">Maw, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">This dissertation is grounded in my praxis as a Hatha yoga teacher in the community. I noticed that particular students were drawn to specific styles of Hatha yoga, whilst avoiding others. I took the styles of Hatha yoga into consideration, but further exploration also gave rise to whether methods of instruction were a fundamental component of the class demography. This in turn led to an examination of my own teaching pedagogy to explore how my philosophical approach to teaching, was in fact, carried over into to my praxis and if this was a factor in student retention in my classes. Studying my own pedagogy as a Hatha yoga teacher meant reviewing my philosophies, both from a theoretical perspective and later from a practical level, to see if my practice followed my philosophy. This could only be realised through a full investigation of my teaching methods, which was achieved by video taping one of my Hatha yoga classes. I believe that understanding originates from personal knowledge; therefore, the research must begin by examining my own pedagogy. In order to answer these questions I have investigated the historical foundations of yoga and the meaning of yoga in the modern Western world. During this process I became aware of the misrepresentations of Hatha yoga and the misconceptions that have derived from this. In order to answer my research question, whether my teaching pedagogy directly influenced the cohort of students who attended my yoga class, I have had to be cognisant of my own pedagogy. In order to achieve this I employed heuristic enquiry and more specifically the methods outline by Clark Moustakas (1990). Heuristic epistemology is achieved by creating phases in which the researcher uses her own experience to investigate and create meaning in which to discover a phenomenon. This method of enquiry offers the researcher non-linear steps with which to structure the process of a personal reflection. Explication of the pedagogy resulted from numerous viewings of the video recording. I reviewed my teaching methods to ascertain if what I said and thought I was doing was what I actually taught.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/186/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The taxonomy, phylogeny and impact of Mycosphaerella species on eucalypts in South-Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Aaron</field><field name="description">Plantation eucalypts are a recent and rapidly growing industry in Australia, and will eventually replace the logging of old-growth forests. Over 40% of these plantations have been established in south-western Australia, where more than 160 000 ha of Eucalyptus globulus plantations now occur. In the early 1900s, this species was widely planted as an exotic in South Africa, but succumbed to severe pest (Gonipterus sp.) and disease (Mycosphaerella sp.) problems. Similarly, in south-western Australia E. globulus is an exotic species, but with the additional threat that it is planted adjacent to indigenous eucalypts, which increases the possibility of pests and pathogens switching between closely related eucalypt hosts. Over the past ten years, there have been anecdotal reports of increasing levels of Mycosphaerella leaf disease (MLD) in E. globulus plantations in south-western Australia. This increase in disease level is of concern to the industry. To date there have been no comprehensive studies into the taxonomy, biogeography and population genetics of MLD in south-western Australia. This thesis investigated the impact of MLD in south-western Australia with a focus on its impact, taxonomy, biogeography and population genetics. It is the first study worldwide to quantify the relative impact of different Mycosphaerella species in a regional plantation estate. 
 
 A survey of pest, disease and nutritional disorders (Chapter 2) found that MLD was the most severe and frequently occurring, single taxonomic health threat to 1 and 2-year-old E. globulus plantations in south-western Australia. For the first time, this survey identified and quantified the impact of pest and disease damage to E. globulus plantations in the region. There were differences in the disease levels between plantations and this was due to initial Mycosphaerella species composition and inoculum level, and local climatic conditions favourable for disease, rather than to the provenance planted or the nutritional status of the individual plantations.
 
 The survey for Mycosphaerella pathogens of eucalypts (Chapter 3) identified two new species of Mycosphaerella (M. ambiphylla and M. aurantia) and extended the known geographic range of eight other species (M. cryptica, M. gregaria, M. lateralis, M. marksii, M. mexicana , M. nubilosa, M. parva and M. suberosa). Of these: M. lateralis and M. mexicana were new records for Australia; and M. gregaria, M. nubilosa and M. parva were new records for Western Australia. A new anamorph, Phaeophloeospora ambiphylla was described and linked to M. ambiphylla. The occurrence of these new species and disease records in south-western Australia is significant for the plantation-eucalypt industry worldwide. The finding of two new species highlighted the need to quantify the disease impact of these on eucalypt plantations; and the extension of the range the remaining species raised important quarantine issues, concerned with the movement of plant material between regions and countries. 
 
 The biogeographical investigation of Mycosphaerella (Chapter 4) identified that the most widespread and serious cause of MLD in south-western Australia is M. cryptica. In addition to occurring on the exotic E. globulus, it also occurs on two of the three important indigenous forestry eucalyptus species in this region. That is, on E. diversicolor, and E. marginata, but not on Corymbia calophylla. In terms of the plantation estate of E. globulus, however, M. nubilosa is the most widespread pathogen. The current study found that MLD on E. globulus is a complex of several different species, whereas, on E. diversicolor and E. marginata it is caused by only M. cryptica. Two species, M. cryptica and M. marksii were found commonly on adult E. globulus leaves. Although M. cryptica was the most frequent and serious cause of disease on adult leaves, M. marksii levels appear to be increasing and the future epidemiology of this pathogen should be closely monitored. There is some concern that these two MLD species could become an economically important problem on adult leaves of E. globulus. At present severe levels of MLD is significantly more common on juvenile than on adult foliage. 
 
 The phylogenetic analysis (Chapter 5), based on ITS rDNA sequences from the present study and those obtained from GenBank accessions, found that Mycosphaerella is an assemblage of largely polyphyletic anamorph genera. Ten distinct clades emerged from the analysis. With the exception of the Dissoconium and the M. recutita clade, which comprised of two and one species respectively, none were comprised entirely of one anamorph genus alone. The anamorph genera represented were often dispersed across more than one clade, indicating that these anamorphs have arisen separately in different phylogenetic lineages. Cercospora, Stenella and Uwebraunia anamorphs each occurred in more than one separate clade. Although on the basis of rDNA sequence data Mycosphaerella appeared mostly monophyletic there was some evidence that the Mycosphaerella genus may be polyphyletic. This was particularly evident from the Dissoconium clade which grouped as closely to the outgroup Botryosphaeria taxon as it did with the remaining Mycosphaerella species. It was argued that a multi-gene phylogeny, which includes sequencing many species in other genera aligned with Mycosphaerella, is required in order to satisfactorily answer the question of whether Mycosphaerella is truly monophyletic. 
 
 The phylogenetic analysis also showed that the taxonomy of Mycosphaerella based on ITS sequence data needs further clarification. Some species that are morphologically distinct, such as M. vespa and M. molleriana, shared identical ITS sequences. Other morphologically distinct species differed by as little as one or two nucleotides. Yet in other cases, the sequence variation amongst isolates from the same species differed substantially. Much of this variation in M. cryptica and other species was attributed to poorly edited sequences that had been lodged with GenBank. It was postulated that although a part of the remaining variation reflected the existence of cryptic species, some was likely to be genuine intra-species differences. It was concluded that further genes need to be sequenced, and more standardised cultural studies conducted in order to define species boundaries within Mycosphaerella.
 
 Based on the ITS rDNA sequence data, two different molecular methods for the identification of Mycosphaerella species from eucalypts were developed (Chapter 6). The first of these was a PCR-RFLP method that enabled the identification of Mycosphaerella species present on eucalypts in south-western Australia. A key is provided, which enabled the identification of species on a combination of PCR-RFLP DNA fragment migration patterns and a small number of morphological features. This key enables the identification of Mycosphaerella species more easily than keys that rely on morphological features alone. Therefore, this has made it easier for non-Mycosphaerella specialists to identify species from this genus. The second molecular method developed for the identification of Mycosphaerella species was that of primers that selectively amplify the DNA of M. cryptica and M. nubilosa, the two most important causes of MLD (Chapter 6). This will allow the rapid identification of these two species by non-specialists in Mycosphaerella taxonomy. The primers from the current study will also enable early diagnosis of the possible causal organism of MLD in a plantation. Once the use of these primers for amplifying DNA from leaf tissue has been optimised, they will also facilitate studies into the early infection process of M cryptica and M. nubilosa. For example, the presence of the pathogen may be detected prior to the appearance of symptoms. Studies may be conducted to determine the length of a hemi-biotrophic phase, and the extent of tissue colonisation both spatially and temporally, beyond the necrotic lesion in these two Mycosphaerella species. Previously, such studies have been hampered by the slow growth rate of these fungi in culture and the lack of media that would allow their selective isolation and detection by directly plating diseased and non-diseased host tissue. 
 
 This study has clearly indicated that Mycosphaerella species are the major disease threat to E. globulus plantations in Western Australia. It has also shown that over the relatively short period of time of less than ten years the number of species recorded has increased from three to ten, and that disease severity has increased in plantations. It is therefore critical to continue the research on this genus in order to understand the biology, epidemiology and population genetics of this pathogen. This is necessary in order to inform tree selection and silvicultural practise that will minimise the future impact of MLD. This is particularly important if the industry moves towards clonal and hybrid forestry as has occurred elsewhere in the world. This study has laid the foundations for future research on this disease through the elucidation of the taxonomy of Mycosphaerella in south-western Australia and by providing some important molecular tools for its diagnosis and further study.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/187/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The postmodern sacred: popular culture spirituality in the genres of science fiction, fantasy and fantastic horror</field><field name="creator">McAvan, Em</field><field name="description">In my thesis I argue that the return of the religious in contemporary culture has been in two forms the rise of so-called fundamentalisms in the established faiths-Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, even Buddhist-and the rise of a New Age style spirituality that draws from aspects of those faiths even as it produces something distinctively different. I argue that this shift both produces post-modern media culture, and is itself always-already mediated through the realm of the fictional. Secular and profane are always entangled within one another, a constant and pervasive media presence that modulates the way that contemporary subjects experience themselves and their relationship to the spiritual. I use popular culture as an entry point, an entry point that can presume neither belief nor unbelief in its audiences, showing that it is 'unreal' texts such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Matrix and so on that we find religious symbols and ideas refracted through a postmodernist sensibility, with little regard for the demands of 'real world' epistemology. 
 
 I argue that it is in this interplay between traditional religions and New Age-ised spirituality in popular culture that the sacred truly finds itself in postmodernity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/188/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catching the ball: constructing the reciprocity of embodiment</field><field name="creator">McCardell, Elizabeth Eve</field><field name="description">This interdisciplinary dissertation is a study of the ways in which we sensually embody and experience ow world. It is a metaphilosophical account that begins within orporeality; indeed, it is suggested that this is the place where the philosophic urge is argued, elaborated, and reflected upon.
 
 While many studies of embodiment tend to focus upon the body as object, cultural artefact, or text for cultural inscription, the approach used in this dissertation is with the incarnation (the making flesh) of interaction in particular socio-physical milieux. The shift is thus from investigation of bodies to bodying, from noun form to transitive verb of incorporealization. This shift is felt necessary in order to better understand the so-called dualisms of traditional Western philosophic thought: mindbody, self-other, self-world, nature-culture, etc., and Tantric inspired Eastern philosophies of self-all relationality. It will be suggested, taking the lead from Leder (1990), that these apparent dualisms are not so much add-ons to philosophies of being, but arise in the experiential body itself.
 
 This dissertation endeavours to rethink certain givens of everyday life, such as perception of time and space, place, enacted memory, having empathic feelings for others, and so on, from within bodily experience and occidental-oriental philosophies of being. Certain neurological disorders are examined for their way of deconstructing elements required to construct a meaningful incarnated life-world. 
 
 The process of embodiment is not only what the body is, but what it does.
 
 My construction of what is necessary for embodiment studies therefore considers bodily praxes (cultural and individual), as well as the sensual, sensate experiences arising in the body.
 
 The image of a ball game is evoked in various ways throughout the dissertation not only because it well describes the dense layers of interaction and an emergent sense of bodiliness, but it also illustrates reciprocity and situatedness.
 
 This thesis is intended to contribute to the health sciences as well as cultural studies. It draws upon the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, J. J. Gibson's ecological psychology, neurological studies and case histories, and the Eastern tradition of Tantrism in its Mahayanist Buddhist and Taoist forms.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/189/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saprophytic ability and the contribution of chlamydospores and oospores to the survival of Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="creator">McCarren, Kathryn</field><field name="description">Phytophthora cinnamomi has been recognised as a key threatening process to Australia's biodiversity by the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.  Despite over 80 years of extensive research, its exact mode of survival is still poorly understood.  It is widely accepted that thin- and thick-walled chlamydospores are the main survival propagules while oospores are assumed to play no role in the survival of the pathogen in the Australian environment, yet evidence is limited.  The saprophytic ability of the pathogen is still unresolved despite the important role this could play in the ability of the pathogen to survive in the absence of susceptible hosts.  This thesis aimed to investigate chlamydospores, oospores and the saprophytic ability of P. cinnamomi to determine their contribution to survival.  
 
 Phytophthora cinnamomi did not show saprophytic ability in non-sterile soils.  The production of thick-walled chlamydospores and selfed oospores of P. cinnamomi in vitro was documented.  Thick-walled chlamydospores were sporadically formed under sterile and non-sterile conditions in vitro but exact conditions for stimulating their formation could not be determined.  The formation of thick-walled chlamydospores emerging from mycelium of similar wall thickness was observed, challenging the current knowledge of chlamydospore formation.  
 
 Selfed oospores were abundant in vitro on modified Ribeiro's minimal medium in one isolate.  Three other isolates tested also produced oospores but not in large numbers.  Although the selfed oospores did not germinate on a range of media, at least 16 % were found to be viable using Thiozolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide staining and staining of the nuclei with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.2HCl (DAPI).  This indicated the potential of selfed oospores as survival structures and their ability to exist dormantly.  
 
 The ability of phosphite to kill chlamydospores and selfed oospores was studied in vitro.  Results challenged the efficacy of this chemical and revealed the necessity for further study of its effect on survival propagules of P. cinnamomi in the natural environment.  Phosphite was shown to induce dormancy in thin-walled chlamydospores if present during their formation in vitro.  Interestingly, dormancy was only induced by phosphite in isolates previously reported as sensitive to phosphite and not those reported as tolerant.  
 
 Chlamydospores were produced uniformly across the radius of the colony on control modified Ribeiro's minimal medium but on medium containing phosphite (40 or 100 mcg ml-1), chlamydospore production was initially inhibited before being stimulated during the log phase of growth.  This corresponded to a point in the colony morphology where mycelial density changed from tightly packed mycelium to sparse on medium containing phosphite.  This change in morphology did not occur when the pathogen was grown on liquid media refreshed every four days, and chlamydospores were evenly distributed across the radius of these colonies.  This trend was not observed in selfed oospores produced in the presence of phosphite.  Selfed oospore production was found to be inhibited by phosphite at the same concentrations that stimulated chlamydospore production.  
  
 Isolates of P. cinnamomi were transformed using a protoplast/ polyethylene glycol method to contain the Green Fluorescent Protein and geneticin resistance genes to aid in future studies on survival properties of the organism.  Although time constraints meant the stability of the transgene could not be determined, it was effective in differentiating propagules of the transformed P. cinnamomi from spores of other microrganisms in a non-sterile environment.  Two different sized chlamydospores (approximately 30 mcg diameter and &lt; 20 mcg diameter) were observed in preliminary trials of transformed P. cinnamomi inoculated lupin roots floated in non-sterile soil extracts and these were easily distinguished from microbial propagules of other species.  The growth and pathogenicity was reduced in two putative transformants and their ability to fluoresce declined over ten subcultures but they still remained resistant to geneticin.  
 
 This study has improved our knowledge on the survival abilities of P. cinnamomi in vitro and has provided a useful tool for studying these abilities under more natural glasshouse conditions.

Discourses around the notion of the civil society and the ways in which social and cultural capital can be acquired and transferred, have led to renewed interest in the economic and social functions of the voluntary, not-for-profit sector of Australian society. 
 
 This thesis aims to advance the critical study of regional cultural development. It examines the role and function of the performing arts within regional communities through a case study of the city of Bunbury, Western Australia. Regional performing arts are often trivialised or marginalised by metropolitan practitioners, critics and academics, particularly as they are almost entirely, in Australia, a volunteer/amateur pursuit. However volunteer performing arts groups provide physical and social spaces that encourage networks of civil engagement that have implications for the functioning of the broader community; and, in the case of Bunbury, a degree of independence from the bureaucratic requirements of arts funding bodies. The thesis proposes that volunteer, not-for-profit (amateur) theatre has a stronger claim on the title 'community theatre' than the state-funded community theatre movement of the 1970s and 1980s. 
 
 The thesis also examines the strong community affiliations that have been generated by the community-owned, professionally-managed Bunbury Regional Entertainment Centre. It situates this discussion in the context of the rapidly changing urban landscape in which the Entertainment Centre is placed and its affiliations with local, regional, state and national funding, networking and touring structures. It argues that considerable social and cultural capital is generated through the active involvement of citizens at many levels of the performing arts in a regional community such as Bunbury. Although for most, the involvement is voluntary and recreational, it also has direct economic outcomes in terms of the developing creative industries of the region.
 
 A major contribution of the thesis is the provision of a model for the function and impact of regional community performing arts as it theorises the tensions between governmental (funding) models and self-generated regional arts practices through case study and detailed analysis. In doing so the thesis contributes to key debates in two significant ways, firstly by providing an important historical/cultural document and secondly, by highlighting new ways of thinking and speaking about the role of the performing arts in regional communities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/191/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of women in Femina: an Indonesian women's magazine</field><field name="creator">Azeharie, Suzy</field><field name="description">Since the advent of the women's movement, the mass media and literary classics have become targets for intensive scrutiny by some feminists who are concerned with the role and influence the media and literature play in promoting a gendered society. This thesis, focuses mainly on representations of Indonesian women as presented by the Jakarta-based women's magazine, femina. By analysing six articles that appeared in the magazine from the 1970s to the 1990s, representations of gender relationships have been highlighted.
 
 Shaped dominantly by Islamic beliefs, and the Javanese values, which consist of a syncretic blend of Animist, Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic beliefs, contemporary Indonesian society is dominated by a strong political state and patriarchal value system which downgrades women. Resulting from the political changes introduced by the New Order, there has been a pivotal transformation of Indonesian women's organisations. The regime strongly encourages wives' organisations, despite the full equality guaranteed to men and women by the 1945 Constitution. It is demanded of Indonesian women that their foremost duties are their motherly and wifely roles. The influence of the priyayi, the Javanese elite, who believe that woman's destiny is primarily centred on her role as wife and mother, is partially responsible for the continuing influence of this ideal and the way it subordinates women to men. The religious traditions are also not without considerable influence in this area. These values can be found in the articles examined. Further, the thesis investigates attitudes to women who work outside the home, the double burden that they carry, and any changes in the representations of women and gender relations over the twenty years as revealed infemina.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/193/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is pay TV meeting its promise?</field><field name="creator">McCutcheon, Marion</field><field name="description">The broadcasting sector is a subject of continual debate in modern society. One of the oldest segments of the rapidly-evolving information technology and communications industry, it is still the most content rich and the most popular. Australians who watch television spend more time doing so than doing any other leisure activity - except those who fish (ABS 1998). Broadcasting is highly pervasive. Some kind of service is available and used in every Australian household. Everyone is an expert, everyone has an opinion. Since the Federal Government decided to allow the introduction of domestic subscription television in 1992, pay television has been broadly dismissed by its media rivals as being unpopular, unprofitable and unnecessary. In turn, the Australian pay television industry considers that it is over-regulated, especially compared to the free-to-air sector, and that much of this regulation severely constrains its ability to grow its subscriber base. This thesis examines whether the Australian subscription television industry has achieved the aims set for it by the legislators in 1992 - that is, whether it has 'met its promise'. To achieve this, the thesis first identifies the 'promises' of an Australian subscription television industry. In assessing whether the industry has met its promise, the thesis considers various aspects of the industry, including what the industry has needed to do to make itself profitable and ensure its longevity and the environment within which the industry operates. The thesis examines the role that content plays in attracting subscribers and considers whether minimal content regulation has resulted in a paucity of local content on subscription television in Australia. The thesis draws on existing academic literature, government publications, information released by the subscription television industry itself and interviews conducted in the course of the project with the Australian subscription television sector. It also uses and builds on ratings data to examine the programs and channels that are offered by Australian pay television services. In concluding, this thesis makes an assessment of whether the Australian pay television industry has met its promise.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/194/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of end user development success</field><field name="creator">McGill, Tanya</field><field name="description">User development of applications provides end users with an alternative to the traditional process of systems development by allowing them to solve job related problems by developing their own software applications. User developed applications (UDAs) support decision making and organisational processes in the majority of organisations, and the ability to develop small applications forms part of the job requirements for many positions. Despite its pervasiveness, there are many risks associated with user development of applications. These risks result primarily from decreases in application quality that arise when end users have had little training and do not follow system development methodologies. 
 
 The primary aim of the research described in this thesis is to gain a better understanding of UDA success. In particular, the thesis considers the role of system quality in UDA success and the ability of end user developers to judge whether the applications they develop will have a positive impact on their performance of tasks. The research also investigates factors that might impact upon this ability. 
 
 The research objectives were addressed through two empirical studies. Two possible models of UDA success provided the starting point for Study 1. The first model is DeLone and McLean's (1992) model of IS success, and the second model is a version of this model that was modified to address concerns about the DeLone and McLean model and to reflect current research about UDA success. The models were tested using data from a field study involving business people participating in a business policy simulation, where they developed spreadsheet applications to assist in decision making. Structural equation modelling was used to test the models. Neither of the models was well supported by the data. However, the analysis provided strong support for relationships between perceived system quality and user satisfaction, information quality and user satisfaction, user satisfaction and intended use, and user satisfaction and individual impact. It is notable that the model paths that were supported in Study 1 were primarily those that reflect user perceptions rather than objective measures. This study highlighted that user perceptions of information systems success play a significant role in the UDA domain. The results did, however, suggest that there might be a direct relationship between system quality and individual impact. 
 
 Study 2 was a laboratory experiment and the participants were end users from a range of organisations. A revised research model was developed based on the findings of Study 1, and structural equation modelling was again used to test the model. The model paths that were supported suggest that for small to moderate applications, increases in spreadsheet development knowledge lead to increases in system quality and consequently the development of better quality spreadsheets. They also suggest that for these kinds of applications, end users have realistic perceptions of system quality and hence that user satisfaction may be an appropriate measure of UDA success. The results of Study 2 also provided insight into the role of user involvement in end user development, clarifying the process by which benefits are obtained. The study also provided insight into the importance of spreadsheet development knowledge for successful use (as well as development) of a spreadsheet application. 
 
 The results described in this thesis have practical implications for the management of user development of applications. They highlight the need either to increase end user levels of development knowledge via training so that end users can cope with applications of greater complexity, or to provide other forms of support for development. The role of organisational standards and guidelines is also be considered in the thesis and it is suggested that there is a particular need for guidelines on what kinds of applications are suitable for end user development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/196/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dialoguing in the desert for sustainable development: ambivalence, hybridity and representations of indigenous people</field><field name="creator">McGrath, Natalie</field><field name="description">Sustainable development is becoming institutionalised across culture and geography as a framework in which to address ecological and social crises that are increasingly apparent and manifesting in diverse ways across local spaces. It is however, dominated by binary thought which is uncomfortable with ambivalence and seperates self from nature and 'the other' of Indigenous people. Indigenous people are beginning to use the discourse of sustainable development but approach this from relational and holistic perspectives. The negotiation of representational structures and responsibility for implementating strategies towards sustainable development must account for these cultural differences and will require dialogue. This thesis explores how institutional practice and discourse frames Indigenous representation and responsibility and how this either enables or disenables dialogue with Indigenous people. 
 
 A case study approach informed the research, and included two consultancy participatory projects in 2001-2004. The case study was located in the Western Desert of Western Australia and involved the Martu people in addition to people working within institutional structures. The first project required extending community development strategies and strengthening Martu representation to take responsibility for a housing development. The second project, titled Dialogue with the Pilbara: Newman Tommorrow, involved encouraging Martu representation in a process based upon deliberative democracy. Reflections from the fieldwork form a considerable part of the analysis. The research also included analysis of a number of interviews with local institutional actors in Newman. Two major themes are outlined: power and representation; and culture. The research is reflexive and involves the use of an autoethnographic story technique which enables a better understanding of the researcher's implicit and changing perspectives. The lessons that emerged from the reflections from the case study are insightful for sustainable development.
 
 The thesis involves two layers (and is structured accordingly): the first relates to a case study and the second to the theory and practice of sustainable development. The concluding section combines these two layers and emphasises the need for greater attention to Indigenous participation and autonomy in order to achieve Indigenous sustainable development. This thesis argues that diverse and hybrid Indigenous voices require considerable amplification within the discourse of sustainable development in order to provide relational and holistic perspectives. Particular focus is required upon the negotiation of representative structures to allow for Indigenous voices to be heard, and thus permit for the negotiation of responsibility across culture (an important consideration of sustainable development). This requires ongoing dialogue, creativity and reflexivity in context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/197/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of ecclesiastical and community cultures on the development of Catholic education in Western Australia, 1846-1890</field><field name="creator">McKenna, Eugene</field><field name="description">Historians have generally tended to represent the pioneering Catholic mission in Western Australia as an homogenous ecclesiastical entity with little cultural diversity. With a few notable exceptions the nature of the Western Australian colonial Catholic mission is portrayed as a 'hibernised' form of Catholicism with an Irish clergy taking care of the pastoral needs of a predominantly working class Irish Catholic constituency. This thesis challenges the traditional paradigm as restrictive, and argues that it ignores significant contextual influences and veils the wider cultural tapestry in which the Western Australian pioneering Catholic mission proceeded.
 
 The traditional analysis of the internal dynamics of the Catholic mission implies that there was a beneficial, almost symbiotic relationship between sympathetic bishops and their 'valiant helpers.' Internal conflicts concerning administrative issues have been represented as little more than mere personality clashes.
 
 The thesis takes a more critical contextual approach and argues that the manifestation of internal dissension during this period can only be fully explained by taking account of external influences rather than local conditions. These influences include both Gallican and Ultramontane ecclesiastical perspectives as well as the individual community cultures that were transported from Europe to the Perth diocese by missionary personnel.
 
 This new perspective corrects the more traditional approach which overlooked the different ecclesiastical approaches, orientations and community cultures that were represented within the colonial Catholic mission. This expansion of the existing interpretative paradigm through which historians view the West Australian Catholic mission in general and the development of the school system in particular marks a significant shifi in the existing historiography. As a consequence, scholars will in future take a more critical approach to the study of not only the Catholic education system but also the Western Australian Catholic mission in general. Rather than representing the definitive closing chapter it is intended that this work will invigorate renewed historical interest in the development of the Australian Catholic mission.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/198/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Questions of popular cult(ure)</field><field name="creator">McRae, Leanne Helen</field><field name="description">Questions of Popular Cult(ure) works in the uncomfortable and unclear spaces of popular culture. This thesis demonstrates how cult cauterizes ambiguity and functions as a framing agent for unpopular politics in popular culture. In tracking the flows and hesitations in the postwar period through the rise of the New Right and identity politics, this thesis shows how cult contains moving and malleable meanings that maneuver through everyday life. It is a slippery and slight subject that denies coherent categorization in definitional frames. 
 
 This thesis negotiates this liminality by tracking broad social shifts in race, class and gender through textualised traces. The complicated concept of cult is activated within a series of case studies. These chapters are linked together to demonstrate the volatile variance of the cult category.
 
 Section one contextualises the terrain of the intellectual work in this thesis. It paints broad brush-strokes of the postwar period, through an animated intersection of politics and popular culture. The first chapter defines the currency of cult in contemporary times. It is devoted to investigating the relationships between colonisation and popular culture. By pondering postcolonialism, this chapter prises open thirdspace to consider how writing and madness performs proximity in the pre and post-colonial world. The 'maddening' of cargo cults by colonisers in Melanesia operates as a metonym for the regulation of marginal modalities of resistance. In popular culture, this trajectory of insane otherness has corroded, with the subversion of cult being appropriated by fan discourses, as worship has become 'accountable' for the mainstream market.
 
 Chapter two unpacks The X-Files as a text tracking the broad changes in politics through popular culture. This innovative text has moved from marginality into the mainstream, mapping meanings through the social landscape. Consciousness and reflexivity in the popular embeds this text in a cult framework, as it demonstrates the movement in meanings and the hegemonic hesitations of the dominant in colonising (and rewriting) the interests of the subordinate as their own.
 
 Section two creates a dialogue between gendered politics and contemporary popular culture. The changes to the consciousness in masculinity and femininity are captured by Tank Girl, Tomb Raider, Henry Rollins and Spike (from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer). These texts perform the wavering popularity of feminism and the ascent of men's studies in intellectual inquiry. Tank Girl articulates unpopular feminist politics through the popular mode of film. The movement to more mainstream feminism is threaded through the third wave embraced by Tomb Raider that reinscribes the popular paradigms of femininity, via colonisation. The computer game discourse permits a pedagogy of power to punctuate Lara Croft's virtual surfaces and shimmer through the past into the present.
 
 Tracking this historical movement, two chapters on masculinity brew the boom in men's studies' questioning of manhood. Henry Rollins is a metonym for an excessive and visible masculinity, in an era where men have remained an unmarked centre of society. His place within peripheral punk performance settles his inversionary identity. Spike from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer demonstrates the contradictions in manhood by moving through the masculine hierarchy to deprioritise men in the public sphere. This is a mobile masculinity in a time where changeability has caused a 'crisis' for men. Both these men embody a challenging and confrontational gender politics. Cult contains these characters within different spaces, at varying times and through contradictory politics.
 
 Section three ponders the place and role of politics at its most persistent and relevant. It demonstrates the consequences for social justice in an era of New Right ideologies. The chapter on South Park mobilises Leftist concerns within an overtly Rightist context, and Trainspotting moves through youth politics and acceleration to articulate movement in resistive meanings. 
 
 These case studies contemplate the journey of popular culture in the postwar period by returning to the present and to the dominant culture. The colonisation of identity politics by the New Right makes the place of cultural studies - as a pedagogic formation - powerfully important. Colonisation of geographical peripheries is brought home to England as the colonisation of the Celtic fringe is interpreted through writing and resistance.
 
 This thesis tracks (and connects) two broad movements - the shifting of political formations and the commodification of popular culture. The disconnecting dialogue between these two streams opens the terrain for cult. In the hesitations that delay their connection, cult is activated to cauterize this disjuncture.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/199/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chineseness at the crossroads: negotiations of Chineseness and the politics of liminality in diasporic Chinese women's lives in Australia</field><field name="creator">Meerwald, Agnes May Lin</field><field name="description">Chineseness at the crossroads examines how Chineseness is negotiated by diasporic Chinese women in Australia. I question the essentialist notions of Chineseness by deploying Homi Bhabha's theory of liminality. This concept of being neither here nor there helped me examine the women's ambiguous experiences of acceptance and rejection, within and across marginal and dominant Australian circles. My position disrupts the binaric frames that divide the old from the new, and the eastern from the western practices for cultural appropriation. It recognises instead the past and the present in the creation of new but familiar versions of Chineseness.
 
 I argue that essentialist norms are commuilicated through cultural semantics to inform how Chineseness is rehearsed. I assert that liminality exposes the power structures that inform these cultural semantics by disrupting the naturalised norms. I posit that the diasporic women's awareness of these interdependent processes enables them to question their practices and ideologies.
 
 I used an autoethnographic technique to collapse the divide between the researcher and the researched. It created a liminal space between the researcher and the researched. This subverted norms of the researcher as the archaeologist of knowledge by enabling the other women's narratives to tell their stories alongside mine. This methodological frame also serves as a prism to examine the intersections of gender, sexuality, family, relationships, language, education, class, age, and religion with Chineseness in the lives of the 39 Malaysian and Singaporean women interviewed.
 
 My results indicate that Chineseness is precarious and indeterminate, and specific to the particular moments of articulation at the crossroads of geopolitical and socioeconomic factors. The versions of Chineseness rehearsed are complexly influenced by the various cultural semantics that impact on the women's negotiations of who they are as diasporic Chinese women in Australia. I conclude with a discussion of how these results challenge current curriculum and pedagogical practices in English classrooms. I argue that a re-examination of these practices will contribute to a more inclusive Australia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/200/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the antiprotozoal activity of some tubulin inhibitors following cyclodextrin complexation</field><field name="creator">Menon, Kathleen Ilona</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of tubulin inhibitors when complexed with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) against a range of protozoan parasites. This approach involved investigations into the complexation of these drugs with HP-beta-CD, and subsequent investigations of these drugs and their complexes in regard to cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, in vitro efficacy against Giardia, Cryptosporidium and rodent malaria (Plasmodium chabaudi), and their in vivo efficacy against Giardia and malaria.
 
 Albendazole (ABZ) is a benzimidazole carbamate with a broad anti-parasite spectrum, while the dinitroanilines trifluralin (TF) and oryzalin (OZ) have recently been found to exhibit activity against certain parasites. All three compounds are microtubule antagonists in either nematodes or weeds and have poor aqueous solubility, with the solubility of ABZ and OZ dependent on pH. Cyclodextrins (CD) have a hydrophobic cavity that allows them to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic drugs, resulting in increased drug aqueous solubility, and often, improved drug dissolution and bioavailability. Thus the complexation of these drugs with HP-beta-CD was investigated. All three compounds exhibited type AL phase solubility diagrams with HP-beta-CD complexation, with additional increases in ABZ and OZ solubility achieved through the manipulation of temperature and pH. OZ displayed a stronger interaction with HP-beta-CD when ionised over its neutral form. However, insufficient concentrations of the TF/HP-beta-CD complex were achieved for drug efficacy studies. The cytotoxicity of the drugs and their complexes was assessed using the assay kit Cytotox 96 with human carcinoma cells. This is a colourimetric assay that measures lactate dehydrogenase release as a consequence of compromised cellular and membrane integrity. Both ABZ and OZ are cytotoxic to rapidly proliferating and differentiating cells but are not cytotoxic to cells in the stationary phase. Complexation did not affect drug cytotoxicity. 
 
 In pharmacokinetic studies, complexation improved ABZ (and metabolites) bioavailability, but had no significant affect on OZ bioavailability. In vitro drug assessment studies found ABZ to be highly effective against Giardia, and effectiveagainst Cryptosporidium and malaria. OZ on the other hand exhibited no activity against Giardia, but was effective against Cryptosporidium and malaria. Complexation did not improve the antiprotozoal efficacy of either ABZ or OZ. In particular, excess HP-beta-CD decreased the antigiardial effects of ABZ, possibly due to competitive complex formation. In addition, complexation did not improve the antiprotozoal effects of ABZ in vivo. 
 
 However, the cytotoxic effect of the ABZ/HP-beta-CD complex was more evident in the treatment of malaria in vivo, resulting in increased anaemia and suppression in weight gain, due to the improved bioavailability of ABZ and metabolites. HP-beta-CD alone was found to be cytotoxic at greater than 2.5%, and inhibited Giardia both in vitro and in vivo at greater than 1% and 2% respectively. This was attributed to membrane disruption caused by the dissolution and removal of membrane components.
 
 In comparison, malaria grew better in the presence of HP-beta-CD in vitro, with no detrimental effect observed at up to 8% HP-beta-CD. This was attributed to either the increased solubilization of a necessary media component, or the complexation and removal of an inhibitory compound from the cultivation medium. Therefore HP-beta-CD complexation did not improve the antiprotozoal activity of the tubulin antagonists ABZ and OZ. However, the results of the pharmacokinetic studies suggest that anthelmintic activity of ABZ, particularly against systemic infections, may be improved with oral administration of the ABZ/HP-beta-CD complex. In addition, the antiparasitic activity of HP-beta-CD alone may be promising, especially against intestinal infections. Finally, the improved in vitro cultivation of P. chabaudi in the presence of HP-beta-CD presents a promising approach to its potential long term cultivation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/201/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Similarities and differences of ecosystems in Mediterranean Australia and Southern Africa, with special reference to infertile sites at the Barrens and the Caledon coast</field><field name="creator">Milewski, Antoni</field><field name="description">Similar ecosystems may be expected where climates and landforms on different continents match. The most detailed tests of such convergence have examined mediterranean areas of Europe, North and South America. This thesis compares mediterranean Australia and southern Africa, two relatively nutrientpoor areas largely neglected in previous studies. Inparticular, two study areas very similar in climate, landform and soils were compared, one at the Barrens on the south coast of Western Australia and the other at the Caledon coast in the southwestern Cape of South Africa.
 
 The less frequent, but heavier, rain in Australia probably led to the anomalous presence of trees there. The height and density of vegetation appeared only weakly related to soil nutrients but strongly correlated with moisture. Conversely, nutrient status rather than climate appeared to govern many of those features of plants that interacted with animals, such as flowers and fruits . This applied particularly to ants, which took seeds bearing elaiosomes, and birds, which took fleshy fruits . Soil fertility thus determined the occurrence of agents which both consumed plants and aided their propagation. Climate, soil and fire, together with the consequent regimes of fiutrient cycling and predation, determined the relativeroles played by endotherms, such as mammals, and by ectotherms, such as reptiles, amphibians and their invertebrate prey.
 
 Despite close matching, small differences in physical factors remained between the two study areas, with commensurate differences in their biological communities. It is suggested that co-adaptation is not a major cause of differences between ecosystems on different continents but rather a consequence of inevitable differences in physical conditions.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/202/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A genealogical study of 'the child' as the subject of pre-compulsory education in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Millei, Zsuzsa</field><field name="description">The study produces a genealogy of 'the child' as the shifting subject constituted by the confluence of discourses that are utilized by, and surround, Western Australian precompulsory education. The analysis is approached as a genealogy of governmentality building on the work of Foucault and Rose, which enables the consideration of the research question that guides this study: How has 'the child' come to be constituted as a subject of regimes of practices of pre-compulsory education in Western Australia?
 
 This study does not explore how the historical discourses changed in relation to 'the child' as a universal subject of early education, but it examines the multiple ways 'the child' was constituted by these discourses as the subject at which government is to be aimed, and whose characteristics government must harness and instrumentalize. Besides addressing the research question, the study also develops a set of intertwining arguments. In these the author contends that 'the child' is invented through historically contingent ideas about the individual and that the way in which 'the child' is constituted in pre-compulsory education shifts in concert with the changing problematizations about the government of the population and individuals. Further, the study demonstrates the necessity to understand the provision of pre-compulsory education as a political practice. 
 
 Looking at pre-compulsory education as a political practice de-stabilizes the takenfor-granted constitutions of 'the child' embedded in present theories, practices and research with children in the field of early childhood education. It also enables the de- and reconstruction of the notions of children's 'participation', 'empowerment' and 'citizenship'. The continuous de- and reconstruction of these notions and the destabilization of the constitutions of 'the child' creates a framework in which improvement is possible, rather than a utopian, wholesale and, thus revolutionary, transformation in early education (Branson and Miller, 1991, p. 187). This study also contributes to the critiques of classroom discipline approaches by reconceptualizing them as technologies of government in order to reveal the power relations they silently wield.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/203/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding pastorally to the ageing population: with a proposed training programme for clergy and lay pastoral workers</field><field name="creator">Barrett-Lennard, Julie</field><field name="description">The increased longevity in contemporary western society is impacting on many service and caring organisations in that they are needing to find ways of responding to the increasing number of older persons who need support.  The Church is not immune from this as statistics demonstrate that the age demographic within the Church is rapidly changing to include many more older persons.  However, evidence is strong that the Church to date has not been as alert as it could have been to the implications of the ageing population, nor has it been awake to the potential available within adult ministry.  Therefore scholars and gerontologists are strident in their attempts to wake the Church from its slumber with respect to responding to the ageing population.
 
 The impetus of this research was to determine how alert the Anglican Diocese of Perth is to this rapidly increasing age demographic, and how well equipped its clergy and lay pastoral workers are to respond to the increasing number of older persons both within the Church and within society.  To achieve this, a survey was conducted amongst a selection of clergy and lay pastoral workers in the Diocese of Perth.  As part of the survey, comments were sought from participants on how important they believed training in ministry to older persons was for them, and what factors would enable and encourage them to attend training in this area. 
 
 The literature reviewed for this research, the survey results, and the ensuing discussion combine to underline the need for ministry to older persons to be taken seriously by the Church.  As a way of stimulating interest, and equipping clergy and lay pastoral workers, in the area of pastoral care of older persons, this thesis provides the structure of a training programme that it is envisaged will be offered to the Anglican Diocese of Perth.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/204/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microcrystalline silicon thin films prepared by hot-wire chemical vapour deposition</field><field name="creator">Mohamed, Eman</field><field name="description">Silicon is widely used in optoelectronic devices, including solar cells. In recent years new forms of silicon have become available, including amorphous, microcrystalline and nano-crystalline material. These new forms have great promise for low cost, thin film solar cells and the purpose of this work is to investigate their preparation and properties with a view to their future use in solar cells.
 
 A Hot Wire-Deposition Chemical Vapour Deposition CVD (HW-CVD) system was constructed to create a multi-chamber high vacuum system in combination with an existing Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) system; to study the amorphous to crystalline transition in silicon thin films. As the two chambers were linked by a common airlock, it was essential to construct a transfer mechanism to allow the transfer of the sample holder between the two systems. This was accomplished by the incorporation of two gate valves between the two chambers and the common airlock as well as a rail system and a magnetic drive that were designed to support the weight of, and to guide the sample holder through the system. 
 
 The effect of different deposition conditions on the properties and structure of the material deposited in the combined HW-CVD:PECVD system were investigated. The conditions needed to obtain a range of materials, including amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline silicon films were determined and then successfully replicated. 
 
 The structure of each material was analysed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The presence of crystallites in the material was confirmed and the structure of the material detected by TEM was compared to the results obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectrum of each sample was decoupled into three components representing the amorphous, intermediate and crystalline phases. The Raman analysis revealed that the amorphous silicon thin film had a dominant amorphous phase with smaller contribution from the intermediate and crystalline phase. This result supported the findings of the TEM studies which showed some medium range order. Analysis of the Raman spectrum for samples deposited at increasing filament temperatures showed that the degree of order within the samples increased, with the evolution of the crystalline phase and decline of the amorphous phase. The Selected Area Diffraction (SAD) patterns obtained from the TEM were analysed to gain qualitative information regarding the change in crystallite size. These findings have been confirmed by the TEM micrograph measurements.
 
 The deposition regime where the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline silicon took place was examined by varying the deposition parameters of filament temperature, total pressure in the chamber, gas flow rate, deposition time and substrate temperature. 
 
 The IR absorption spectrum for [mu]c-Si showed the typical peaks at 2100cm-1 and 626cm-1, of the stretching and wagging modes, respectively. The increase in the crystallinity of the thin films was consistent with the evolution of the 2100cm-1 band in IR, and the decreasing hydrogen content, as well as the shift of the wagging mode to lower wavenumber. IR spectroscopy has proven to be a sensitive technique for detecting the crystalline phase in the deposited material.
 
 Several devices were also constructed by depositing the [mu]c-Si thin films as the intrinsic layer in a solar cell, to obtain information on their characteristics. The p- layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited in the PECVD chamber, and the sample was then transferred under vacuum using the transport system to the HW-CVD chamber where the i-layer (microcrystalline silicon) was deposited. The sample holder was transferred back to the PECVD chamber where the n-layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited. 
 
 The research presented in this thesis represents a preliminary investigation of the properties of [mu]c-Si thin films. Once the properties and optimum deposition characteristics for thin films are established, this research can form the basis for the optimization of a solar cell consisting of the most efficient combination of amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline materials.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/205/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The culture of coccolithophorid algae for carbon dioxide bioremediation</field><field name="creator">Moheimani, Navid Reza</field><field name="description">The culture of coccolithophorid algae is an attractive option for sequestration or recycling of CO2 as they can fix carbon by photosynthesis as well as in calcium carbonate scales known as coccoliths. They also produce high amounts of lipids which have a potential application as a renewable fuel. 
 
 Five species of coccolithophorids (Pleurochrysis carterae, CCMP647, Pleurochrysis sp. CCMP1211, Gephyrocapsa oceanica CS-335/2, Emiliania huxleyi CCMP371, and Emiliania huxleyi CS-369) were screened for their ability to grow at high temperature. All species grew up to 28oC except E. huxleyi CS-369. However, Pleurochrysis sp. CCMP 1211 which was found to clump and can therefore not be recommended for large-scale cultivation. The salinity tolerance of these species was also examined. 
 
 Growth of P. carterae, G. oceanica, and E. huxleyi in laboratory scale closed photobioreactors (plate, carboy, airlift, and tubular photobioreactors) showed the plate photobioreactor to be the best closed cultivation system. The highest productivities were achieved by P. carterae in the plate photobioreactor and were 0.54 g.L-1.d-1, 0.12 g.L-1.d-1, 0.06 g.L-1.d-1 for total dry weight, lipid and CaCO3 respectively. The growth of P. carterae and E. huxleyi was also examined in an outdoor raceway pond. The E. huxleyi culture was easily contaminated resulting in the loss of the culture in less than three weeks, but P. carterae grew well over a period of 13 months. The overall total dry weight productivity of P. carterae was 0.19 g.L-1.d-1 with lipid and CaCO3 contents of up to 33% and 10% of dry weight respectively. There was little protozoan and bacterial contamination. Medium pH increased to pH 11 during the day and was found to be a reliable variable for maintaining the health of the culture. A maximum pH achieved during the day of less than pH 8.5 indicated the imminent collapse of the culture. Heavy rain and low temperature were the main reasons for culture loss in mid winter, whereas high temperature during summer favoured P. carterae growth. A comparison of the growth of P. carterae and Dunaliella salina MUR8 in the raceway ponds showed no significant differences between these two species with regard to areal total dry weight productivity and lipid content. 
 
 The effects of several limiting factors were also examined. A reduction in medium pH resulting from CO2 addition inhibited the growth of E. huxleyi in the plate photobioreactor, whereas P. carterae growth and productivities increased in the pH range of pH 7.7 to 8.0 in the plate photobioreactor and pH 9.1 to 9.6 in the outdoor raceway pond. The best operational pond depth for outdoor raceway culture of P. carterae was between 16 cm and 21 cm. Early morning temperatures, especially during the winter, highly affected the growth of P. carterae in the raceway pond, whereas artificially increasing the medium temperature improved the health of the culture but resulted in little increase in productivity. Photosynthesis of P. carterae was found to be highly inhibited by high oxygen concentration in the medium irrespective of temperature or irradiance. 
 
 An economic model of P. carterae in a 63 ha raceway plant resulted in a cost for the biomass of between 7.35 Aus$.Kg-1 and 14.17 Aus$.Kg-1 depending on the harvesting method used.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/206/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediating classrooom culture based on democratic values: an exploration of a teacher's facilitative role</field><field name="creator">Morcom, Veronica</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to examine the teacher's facilitative role to engage students in Values Education (Curriculum Council, 1998) based on a cooperative and collaborative learning pedagogy. The study was conducted in a primary school classroom with thirty-one year 4/5 students aged 9-10 years of age. 
 
 During the research process the core shared values underpinning the Western Australian Curriculum Framework (Curriculum Council, 1998) provided the foundation to negotiate agreements for behaviour based on The Tribes process (Gibbs, 2001), which included mutual respect, in order to foster a safe, supportive and democratic classroom culture. The Tribes process was used to operationalise the teaching of values, social skills, cooperation and collaboration. Hart's (1992) collaborative framework informed the organisation of the classroom to create the conditions that supported collaboration amongst peers and the teacher. 
 
 An action research approach was used to reflect on the classroom context and provide a focus for a range of qualitative research methods. Multiple data sources such as teacher observations, interviews, student and teacher reflection logs and sociograms were used to triangulate findings from parents, students and teachers. A sociocultural perspective (Vygotsky, 1978) provided the conceptual framework for this study as the underlying assumption is that students learn from each other, mediated by the teacher or more capable peers. The focus on the action within the social context during the development of interpersonal relationships is a key feature of peer mediated learning, which complemented the processes chosen by the teacher researcher to elucidate how a safe, supportive and democratic classroom was created. Class meetings, group work and reflective practices were used to scaffold students' understandings of interpersonal relationships to promote a culture that was consistent with Australia's democratic traditions. Reflective practices in the classroom provided opportunities for new perspectives to be developed, as new knowledge and experiences were integrated with existing personal practical knowledge.
 
 The major findings reflected the foci of student and teacher conversations about students' interpersonal skills and their ability to get along with each other. In the first phase of the study establishing positive 'relationships' based on trust, through teambuilding activities provided the impetus for the next phase of the study about 'leadership'. This phase continued for most of the study, and provided authentic opportunities for students to develop leadership skills, which permeated the last phase of the study about 'friendships'. Students established mutually beneficial relationships that broadened their views about discriminatory behaviours, friendship and leadership.
 
 The major conclusions drawn from the study is that teachers play a significant role in mediating positive relationships amongst peers. Further, it was evident that the explicit teaching of core shared values (Curriculum Council, 1998) provided the foundations of productive and active citizenship during the process of creating the conditions for a safe, supportive and democratic classroom.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/207/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pulp literature: a re-evaluation</field><field name="creator">Morgan, David Ellis</field><field name="description">The purpose of this dissertation is to redress the literary academy?s view of Pulp Literature as an inconsequential form, which does not merit serious contemplation, or artistic recognition.

Therefore, rather than continuing along this downward path, this thesis focuses more on the subversive machinations of Pulp Literature as a social, economic, political, and theoretical force with its own strategies and agendas, opening with an investigation of the history of Pulp Literature as a cultural form. 
 
 I argue that, from its very conception with the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century, Pulp has always offered a radical alternative to the mainstream by providing a voice for the marginalised and the oppressed in the societies of the world. The thesis traces this political role as the aesthetic evolves into the new forms and technologies of a contemporary culture, where many academics still refuse to acknowledge Pulp as an important agent for the transmission of ideological views, and an impetus to instigate social change. The concluding arguments move away from the quantitative, to the more theoretically evaluative section of the thesis. This consists of a discussion of the conceptual boundaries surrounding the aesthetic of Pulp, broaching such subjects as literary evaluation, canonicity, and canon formation. This debate ultimately revolves around the question, 'if literary theorists cannot 'objectively' determine what literary 'quality' is, then how can we hope to define Pulp?'
 
 In an attempt to answer this question, the thesis juxtaposes the criteria of a number of literary theorists from this field of inquiry, namely, Thomas R. Whissen, Clive Bloom, Thomas J. Roberts, Harold Bloom, Andrew Calcutt and Richard Shephard, to formulate an aesthetic that is not only markedly different to their's, but more significantly, one which situates Pulp Literature at the head of the literary academic table.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/208/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bad habits temptation and the divided self: a work of fiction and a critical accompaniment using the lunatic asylum, the theatre and the uncanny motif of the double, in the context of nineteenth-century Fremantle, to explore female sexuality and fractured</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Joanna</field><field name="description">Bad Habits: Temptation &amp; The Divided Self is a thesis comprising an original work of fiction and a critical accompaniment, which use the lunatic asylum, the theatre and the uncanny motif of the double, in the context of nineteenth-century Fremantle, to interrogate social conformity and the patriarchal repression of female sexuality.
 
 Victorian society polarised women into either selfless, virtuous angels of the house or fallen women beyond redemption. While the former exemplified an unforgiving, patriarchal notion of femininity, the latter bore the stigma of 'moral insanity' and, given the right circumstances, could lead to a period of incarceration in the lunatic asylum. Thus, in fledgling Fremantle, psychiatry and the gothic lunatic asylum were deeply implicated in enforcing a patriarchal ideology on women. 
 
 The Victorian rhetoric of virtue considered women more susceptible than men to the contaminating forces of such cultural phenomena as novels and the theatre. As such, actresses were both cause and effect of social contamination: not quite fallen, but similarly tainted. The protagonist in my historical fiction is an actress who experiences an uncomfortable dual consciousness when on stage as her 'awareness' watches from the wings, surveyor of herself surveyed. This duality is further entrenched when she is photographed by a local portrait artist and is admitted to Fremantle's lunatic asylum for wilful and 'promiscuous' behaviour, diagnosed as suffering symptoms of 'moral insanity'. 
 
 Deprived of her freedom, she learns to view her past as something shameful and unnatural and is thus triumphant when she makes permanent the cleavage between her new conscience and her old. It is only on her release that she discovers the consequences of that division: an uncanny but inescapable relationship with her living, breathing double.
 
 Today, women are bombarded with images of the ideal feminine and girls are sexualised at an increasingly young age, and so a discussion of femininity, as defined by patriarchy, and the way it shapes a woman's identity are as relevant as it has ever been. 
 
 Bad Habits is designed to evoke a gothic Fremantle in which to explore motifs that arise in the numerous texts on the gothic and the uncanny manifestation of the divided self. These literary texts, read alongside those which analyse the fixation of Victorian society on the bodies, minds and weaknesses of women, have provided the framework for a critical analysis of the finished work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/209/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independent scholarly reporting about conflict interventions: negotiating aboriginal native title in south Australia</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Judith Ellen</field><field name="description">This thesis uses an action research methodology to develop a framework for improving independent scholarly reporting about interventions addressing social or environmental conflict. As there are often contradictory interpretations about the causes and strategic responses to conflict, the problem confronting scholar-reporters is how to address perceptions of bias and reflexively specify the purpose of reporting. It is proposed that scholar-reporters require grounding in conventional realist-based social theory but equally ability to incorporate theoretical ideas generated in more idealist-based peace research and applied conflict resolution studies. To do this scholar-reporters can take a comparative approach systematically developed through an integrated framework as described in this thesis. 
 
 Conceptual and theoretical considerations that support both conventional and more radical constructions are comparatively analysed and then tested in relation to a case study. In 2000 Aboriginal people throughout South Australia deliberated whether their native title claims could be better accorded recognition through conservative court processes or a negotiation process to allay deep-seated conflict. The author, in a scholar-reporter capacity, formulated a report attributing meaning to this consultative process. 
 
 As such a report could have been formulated according to alternative paradigms, methodological approaches and theoretical frameworks, the analysis of the adopted framework highlights how different approaches can bias the interpretation of the process and prospects for change. Realist-based conservative interpretations emphasise 'official' decision-making processes where legitimacy is expressed through political and legal frameworks based on precedent. Idealist-based interpretations emphasise that circumstances entailing significant conflict warrant equal consideration being given to 'non-official' 'resolutionary' problem-solving processes where conflict is treated as a catalyst for learning and outcomes are articulated as understanding generated about conflict and how different strategies can transform it. 
 
 The developed integrated framework approach establishes the independence of scholarly reporting. Its purpose goes beyond perpetuating scholarly debate about alternative 'objective' understandings of conflict; it focuses primarily on communicating a more inclusive understanding of the contradictions inherent in a particular conflict. It increases the capacity to understand when, where, why and how conflict precipitates social change, and articulates possibilities for reconceptualising what might be the more sustainable direction of change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/210/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable urban water systems: policy and professional praxis</field><field name="creator">Mouritz, Mike</field><field name="description">The provision of water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure is an essential ingredient of cities. However, questions are being raised about the type and form of urban infrastructure, for economic and environmental reasons. Traditionally these techologies have offered linear solutions, drawing increasing volumes of water into cities and discharging waste at ever increasing levels, causing escalating stress on the environment. In addition the costs of water infrastructure provision and replacement, both in the developing and developed world, is becoming prohibitive. In response, a new paradigm has been called for and new solutions are emerging that have been labelled as Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM). This concept can be considered to consist of both technical and philosophical dimensions, and represents a new form of professional praxis. However, the adoption of these techniques and concepts is constrained by the inertia of the existing urban water systems. It is therefore argued that the introduction of any change must occur across a number of dimensions of the technoeconomic system of the city. These dimensions-artefacts and technical systems (i.e. the technology and knowledge systems), professional praxis and socio-political context (i.e. institutions, culture and politics) and biophysical realities and world views (i.e. the environment and underlying values) - provide a framework for analysis of the change process - both how it is occurring and how it needs to occur. This framework is used to illustrate the link between environment values and the process of technological innovation, and points to the need for the emerging values and innovations to be institutionalised into the professional praxis and socio-political context of society. Specifically, it is argued  that a new form of transdisciplinary professional praxis is emerging and needs to be cultivated. A broad review of the literature, an evaluation of selected emerging technologies and three case studies are used to illustrate and argue this position. These examples show the potential economic, social and environmental benefits of IUWM and provide some insight into the potential which this approach has to influence the form and structure of the city and at the same time highlighting the institutional arrangements required to manage urban water systems.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/211/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Larval fish assemblages in coastal, shelf and offshore waters of south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Muhling, Barbara</field><field name="description">Larval fish assemblages were investigated during a three-year multidisciplinary project conducted off the coast of south-western Australia. Larvae were sampled using replicated oblique bongo net tows along a five-station transect extending from inshore (18m depth) to offshore waters (1000m depth). A total of 148 taxa from 93 teleost families were identified. Larvae of Gobiidae, and Blenniidae were abundant inshore, while larvae of pelagic and reef-dwelling families, such as Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Carangidae and Labridae were common in continental shelf waters. Larvae of oceanic families, particularly Myctophidae, Phosichthydae and Gonostomatidae, dominated offshore assemblages. Inshore larval fish assemblages were the most seasonal, in terms of species composition and abundance, with offshore assemblages the least so. 
 
 Multivariate statistical analyses revealed larval fish assemblages to have a strong temporal and spatial structure. Assemblages were closely correlated to water masses, with species distributions reflecting both cross shelf and along-shore oceanographic processes and events. The strength and position of the warm, southward flowing Leeuwin Current, and of the cool, seasonal, northward flowing Capes Current were shown to drive much of the variability in the marine environment, and thus larval fish assemblages.
 
 Many of the distinctions between larval fish assemblages on the continental shelf were attributable to patterns of abundance in clupeiform larvae. While larvae of Engraulis australis and Spratelloides robustus showed clear seasonal and spatial distribution patterns, larvae of Sardinops sagax and Etrumeus teres were found throughout the year, with high interannual variability in abundance. Abundances of larvae from all pelagic clupeiform species were negatively correlated to microzooplankton concentrations. Peaks of abundance of S. sagax and E. teres, in particular, appeared to be better aligned with favourable transport and retention conditions. 
 
 A detailed comparison of the horizontal and vertical distribution of larval fishes highlighted the influence of contrasting oceanographic conditions between summer and winter on larval fish assemblages. Although most fish larvae were found above the thermocline, depth distributions differed between taxa, and were shown to influence their offshore transport. Neustonic fish larvae showed potential for significant dispersion during summer, as a result of offshore Ekman transport. 
 
 Mesoscale Leeuwin Current eddies were a feature of the oceanography of the region, and their influence on larval fish assemblages was examined in both an anti-cyclonic eddy (warm-core) and a cyclonic eddy (cold-core). The warm-core eddy contained larval fish assemblages that were distinct from those in the cold-core eddy, with lower larval fish concentrations, especially in the eddy centre. Although the eddies originated near the continental shelf, larval fish assemblages within both eddies were largely oceanic, probably a result of the age of the eddies when they were sampled (about 5 months). 
 
 Overall, larval fish assemblages showed strong temporal and spatial structure, and were well aligned to water masses in the region. The unique oceanography off south western Australia thus has considerable implications for both larval fish transport, and potential recruitment to regional fisheries.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/212/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc requirements of transplanted oilseed rape</field><field name="creator">Mulyati,</field><field name="description">Transplanting is a common practice for many horticultural crops and some field crops. Recently, transplanted oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops have been reported to be sensitive to zinc (Zn) deficiency. However, Zn nutrition in transplanted field crops has not been investigated in detail. The objectives of this present research were to investigate whether transplanting increases external Zn requirements of transplanted oilseed rape, and the mechanisms of root function, growth and Zn uptake after transplanting including rhizosphere modification capacity by plant roots. The second objective was to examine the relative effects of root pruning and transplanting on Zn responses of oilseed rape, and the third objective was to determine external and internal Zn requirements of transplanted oilseed rape for diagnosing and predicting Zn deficiency. 
 
 An experiment on a low Zn sand  (DTPA extractable Zn 0.14 mg kg-1) was set up to determine whether transplanted oilseed rape had a higher Zn requirement than that of direct-sown plants. Low Zn supply depressed shoot dry weight, however, root growth was relatively more strongly suppressed than shoots. Maximum root dry weight required much higher external Zn for transplanted plants compared to direct-sown plants, whilst shoot dry weight required a similarly low external Zn supply. In addition, transplanted plants were sensitive to zinc deficiency during the early post-transplanting growth, and the response weakened as the plants recovered from root injury or transplanting stress. However, the transplanted plants also experienced root pruning before transplanting and so in this experiment the higher Zn requirement could have been due to root pruning or transplanting or both. 
 
 A further experiment was undertaken to determine the comparative external Zn requirements of direct-sown and transplanted plants in well-stirred chelate-buffered solution culture where a rhizosphere effect on plant availability of Zn forms is absent and the effects of  poor root-soil contact on post-transplanting growth are minimized.  In solution culture at the same level of Zn supplied, direct- sown plants produced higher shoot and root dry matter and greater root length than those of transplanted plants.  However, since a higher external Zn requirement was found for transplanted plants in buffered solution culture than for direct- sown plants, it was concluded that the higher Zn requirement was not related to decreased rhizosphere modification, to greater demand for Zn or to poor root-solution contact, but rather to the time required for transplanted plants to recover from transplanting and root injury. The recovery of root function in solution culture was more rapid than that in soil culture and expressed as a higher Zn requirement for shoot as well as root growth. It suggested that the delay in root recovery in soil culture was due to slower absorption of Zn from the soil after transplanting than was the case in solution culture. 
 
 Chelate-buffered nutrient solution culture and harvesting plants successively at 5 day intervals until 25 days after transplanting was used to examine the mechanisms of the recovery of root growth and function. In this experiment, the external Zn requirement of transplanted plants was investigated with unpruned or pruned root systems. Plants with unpruned root system and sufficient Zn supply exhibited faster recovery from transplanting than those with pruned root system plants. The results suggest that root pruning impaired Zn uptake by plant roots and slowed down the root and shoot growth after transplanting. Increased solution Zn partly alleviated the effects of root pruning and presumably this is a major reason why transplanted oilseed rape had a high external Zn requirement. However, root pruning also appeared to impair water uptake, and may have suppressed shoot growth through sequestering carbon for new root growth and through decreased phytohormone production by roots. 
 
 Since rapid root recovery of transplanted plants is essential for successful of growth in the field, Zn application to the nursery bed was explored as a starter   fertilizer to stimulate root growth after transplanting. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether increasing the seedbed Zn would stimulate new root growth of transplanted oilseed rape, and therefore would alleviate the need for increased external Zn for post-transplanting growth. Results showed that adequate Zn concentration in the seedbed promoted the post-transplanting growth by stimulating the new root growth especially increased root length, and also hastened the recovery of root systems. However, high Zn concentration at transplanting still had a more dominant effect in stimulating the new root growth of oilseed rape after transplanting. 
 
 The final experiment was set up using rhizobags with three rates of Zn supply and unpruned or pruned root systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the chemical change in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere or bulk soil and its relationship to the recovery of root function after transplanting, and also to identify and quantify the organic acids in soil extracts of direct-sown and transplanted plants. The rhizosphere soil pH was lower than that of non-rhizosphere soil, and the decrease of soil pH was suggested as the mechanism of the increase of Zn availability and mobility in the rhizosphere soil. Direct-sown plants were more efficient in utilizing Zn than those of transplanted plants especially compared to those of plants with pruned root system. Zinc deficient plants excreted higher concentration of organic acids particularly citric acid, suggesting this was a mechanism of Zn mobilization and Zn uptake by roots of oilseed rape. 
 
 The main implications of the present study for the management of Zn nutrition of transplanted crops were: the need to increase the Zn application to crops in the nursery and at transplanting compared to direct-sown plants; the possibility that external requirements of other nutrients will be greater in transplanted crops also requires further consideration; and in cropping systems where transplanting is practised, greater attention should be given to the avoidance of root damage during the transplanting.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/213/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficacy and immunological mechanisms of type 1 interferon gene therapy in murine cytomegalovirus</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, Emmalene J.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a comparative analysis of the type I Interferon (IFN) subtypes and an evaluation of their potential as DNA vaccines in a model of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and disease. MCMV induces acute and chronic phases of myocarditis, a heart disease characterised by an inflammatory cell infiltrate, in susceptible BALB/c mice.
 
 The type I IFNs comprise 14 IFN alpha genes in the human and &gt;10 IFN alpha genes in the mouse with a single IFN beta gene in both species, however, the purpose of their multiplicity has remained unclear to date. An extensive panel of murine type I IFN subtype genes, including IFNA1, A2, A4, A5, A6, A9 and B, were sub-cloned into the mammalian expression vector pkCMVint (Vical, Inc.) for expression in BALB/c mice. These DNA constructs express biologically active IFN both in vitro and in vivo with systemic, low level expression persisting in the mouse for up to 4 weeks. The individual type I IFN subtypes differentially affect the immune response to MCMV challenge. IFNA6 proved most efficacious, reducing viral replication and inflammation in the acute and chronic phase of disease. Data suggests this occurs via induction of a Th1-like cytokine and antibody response. Furthermore, IFNA6 inoculation after the acute phase was shown to protect mice from the onset of chronic myocarditis. Characterisation of the immune cell response in IFN-treated, MCMV-infected mice demonstrated that type I IFN subtypes modulate the type of immune cells infiltrating the myocardium during myocarditis. Notably, reduced CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and B cell numbers in the heart was associated with reduced chronic myocarditis. Finally, coadministration of type I IFNs, in particular, IFNA6 and IFNB, synergistically improved immunotherapy against MCMV infection and myocarditis. 
 
 The findings detailed here highlight the potential for the type I IFNs as DNA vaccines and most importantly, demonstrate that the type I IFNs have differential antiviral and immunomodulatory efficacies in the MCMV model of infection and myocarditis.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/214/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scientific literacy for sustainability</field><field name="creator">Murcia, Karen</field><field name="description">We only need to consider public media reports to appreciate that there is growing concern amongst citizens for sustainability. This concern arises from increasing appreciation that the current direction and rate of exploitation of resources is not sustainable and humanity's actions today are arguably compromising future generations' ability to meet their living needs. By drawing on the research of scientists, ranging from their evidence of the problems of sustainability to those promising solutions, the same press reports show strong links between sustainability and science. The appearance of such reports in the public media implies that citizens understand the interaction of science and sustainability and that they can engage critically with scientific research, including its applications and implications for sustainability. In this dissertation this understanding and capacity to engage critically is termed scientific literacy. The general question governing the research reported in this dissertation arose from this context and is: What does it mean for citizens to be scientifically literate within the context of sustainability? More specifically, because it is expected that university graduates are well educated in a socially relevant manner, with commensurate responsibilities and influence, the focus question studied in this dissertation is: What does it mean for university graduates to be scientifically literate?
 
 It became apparent from the review of the literature, that the concept of scientific literacy was multidimensional. The three key dimensions that emerged were (i) the fundamental and enduring ideas and concepts of science, (ii) the nature of science and (iii) the interaction of science with society. These dimensions provided the framework for the research reported in this dissertation. Within this framework and based on the literature, two relationships amongst these dimensions were proposed. The first relationship was that the dimensions were in a conceptual hierarchal order, with successive dimensions including the previous dimensions and expanding upon them. The second relationship was that students' scientific literacy developed sequentially along the same hierarchy. It was proposed that development occurred sequentially, with development of concepts of science first, nature of science second and interaction with society last. It was proposed that a scientifically literate person would have reached the level of understanding that includes the interaction of science with society. Specific indicators of the successive dimensions were functional, conceptual/procedural and multidimensional, which at this highest level, includes the relationship between the first two dimensions and society.
 
 This framework and the associated indicators were used as a structure and lens for interrogating the development of scientific literacy of 244 first year university students enrolled in Australia's Murdoch University's foundation unit, Life and the Universe. This is one of five units from which first year students are required to select one. The units are interdisciplinary in nature with Life and the Universe being a unit that covers generic issues in science. In part because of its content and in part because it allows students from all backgrounds to enrol, it was considered suitable for studying, illustratively, the development of scientific literacy of potential university graduates. The development of scientific literacy was studied in three ways. First, participants responded to open questions about a newspaper report of science, before and after their studying in Life and the Universe, second, they responded to a Likert style questionnaire regarding the nature of science, again before and after studying the unit, and third, a subset of participants were involved in a focus group run over two years.
 
 The participants' responses to the open questions on the questionnaire were analysed for their critical engagement with the news brief, in terms of their ability to give reasons why the text should be accepted or rejected. The nature of requests for extra information about the news brief's content was also analysed. Analysis of the initial responses to the open questions showed that more than fifty percent of the participants in this study did not demonstrate the ability to critically engage with science reported in the news.
 
 The Likert style questionnaire assessed participants' conception of the nature of science, with one end of the continuum reflecting a traditional view that science was a body of unchanging facts, derived from objective and value free observations, and the other reflecting a more contemporary view, that scientific knowledge was dynamic, open to change, had subjective components, and had scientists socially located so that their work was not free of values. Analysis of the initial responses to the Nature of Science questionnaire showed that more than fifty percent of the participants were located on the continuum towards the contemporary, socially located end. However, it also showed that the majority were still not sufficiently located towards the contemporary end of the continuum to view science as dynamic, with a changing body of knowledge. There was no statistically significant difference in these analyses in relation to participants' gender, time out of school, course of enrolment or science background.
 
 Unexpectedly, the comparison in the analysis of the news brief pre and post Life and the Universe showed that the number of participants engaging critically did not increase. More expectedly, the comparison of the pre and post Life and the Universe responses to the Likert scale showed that there was overall a statistically significant increase in the group's contemporary, socially located, perspective of the nature of science during their participation in the foundation unit. Specifically, the participants demonstrated raised awareness of the tentative and subjective nature of science and that scientists study a world in which they are a part and, as such, their work is not objective or value free. Nevertheless, there was substantial possibility of higher locations on the scale which the majority of participants did not reach. This statistically significant increase, but possibility for further improvement, is compatible with the lack of increase in critical engagement with the news brief and suggests that the statistical increase was not educationally significant.
 
 The focus group data contributed greater depth of understanding to the researcher about the range in participants' conceptions of the nature of science. The conceptions evident were consistent with the conclusions from the open questions and Likert style questionnaire and also highlighted limited understandings of scientific processes or scientific methods. It was evident that misconceptions and naive understandings of the contemporary nature of science were present at the beginning and retained throughout the foundation unit learning experience. These limitations helped explain participants' inability to engage meaningfully and to question critically the science news briefs contained in the questionnaires. Data from the focus group also suggested that a limited understanding of science terms prevented critical engagement with the content of the news briefs.
 
 Following closely the focus group participants' development of scientific literacy over a two year period, allowed the researcher to gain a greater depth of understanding of the participants' development of scientific literacy than that which could be gained alone from the large scale administrations of the questionnaire. This experience highlighted that the development of scientific literacy was far more complex than the originally proposed sequential development across the three dimensions. The analysis of converging sources of data challenged this proposition and resulted in a reconstruction of understanding about the development of scientific literacy. It was evident that the ability and disposition to critically question and act scientifically required parallel development of science content, socially located conceptions of the nature of science and understanding of its interaction with society. It was the blended and parallel development of these knowledge dimensions, at any level, that demonstrated scientific literacy.
 
 In order to characterise the more complex structure amongst the dimensions in which parallel development occurred, a rope metaphor was used. This metaphor effectively represented the observed development of scientific literacy, as it made concrete the interwoven threads of multidimensional knowledge. It represented more realistically the complex, intertwining and multidimensional aspects of participants' development of scientific literacy. Re-thinking the development of scientific literacy and representing the construct with the rope metaphor offered possibilities for effective pedagogy in higher education. The interaction of multidimensional threads of knowledge seems an integral part of the development of scientific literacy and suggests the need for teaching and learning experiences that are holistic in nature and driven by socially relevant contexts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/216/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bitch: the politics of angry women</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Kylie</field><field name="description">'Bitch: the Politics of Angry Women' investigates the scholarly challenges and strengths in re theorising popular culture and feminism.

 Feminism is a large and brawling paradigm that struggles to incorporate a diversity of feminist voices. This thesis joins the fight. It argues that feminism is partly constituted through popular cultural representations. The separation between the academy and popular culture is damaging theoretically and politically. Academic feminism needs to work with the popular, as opposed to undermining or dismissing its relevancy.
 
 Cultural studies provides the tools necessary to interpret popular modes of feminism. It allows a consideration of the discourses of race, gender, age and class that plait their way through any construction of feminism. I do not present an easy identity politics.

 I mine a series of sites for feminist meanings and potential, ranging across television, popular music, governmental politics, feminist books and journals, magazines and the popular press. The original contribution to knowledge that this thesis proffers is the refusal to demarcate between popular feminism and academic feminism.

In practice, the scientist-practitioner model of psychotherapy, a seemingly dualistic model, prefers determinism of science to free will of choice in humans.
 
 In particular, the model does not see reason and emotion as co-conditioning causes of human behaviour and suffering within the interdependent aggregates of self, other, and environment. Instead, it argues for wrong reasoning as the cause of emotional suffering.
 
 In Western thought, such narrative began at the arrival of scripted language and abstract thought in Greek antiquity that has led psychotherapy to think ignorantly that emotions are un-reasonable therefore they are irrational. Only rational thinking can effectively remove un-reasonable emotions.
 
 This belief creates confusion between rational theory and rational method of studying change in emotion because of the belief that science cannot objectively measure emotions. As a result, rational epistemologies that are ignorant of moral and metaphysical issues in human experience have multiplied. These epistemologies not only construct an unchanging rational identity, but also uphold the status of permanent self-authority.
 
 Fortunately, recent developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience research have quashed such ideas of permanent self-identity and authority.
 
 Buddhist theory of Interdependent Arising and Conditional Relations sees such identity and authority as arisen together with deluded emotional desires of greed and hatred.
 
 These desires co-condition interdependent states of personal feeling and perception (metaphysics), conceptual thinking and consciousness (epistemology) and formation of (moral) emotion and action within the context of self-other-environment matrix. Moral choices particularly highlight the intentional or the Aristotelian final cause of action derived from healthy desires by valued meaning makings and interpretations.
 
 Theravada formulation aims to end unhealthy desires and develop the healthy ones within the matrix including the client-clinician-therapeutic environment contexts.
 
 Theravada treatment guides a tripartite approach of practicing empathic ethics, penetrating focus and reflective understanding, which integrates ecologically with Western rational analysis. It also allows scientific method of studying change in emotion by applying the theory of defective desires.
 
 In addition, interdependent dimensions of thinking and feeling understood from Theravada perspective present a framework for developing theory and treatment of self disorders.
 
 Thus, Theravada treatment not only allows scientific method of studying change in emotion and provides an interdependent theory and treatment but also ecologically integrates with Western rational analysis. Moreover, Theravada approach offers an open framework for further development of theoretical and treatment models of psychopathology classified under Western nomenclature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/218/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A semiotic investigation of the digital: what lies beyond the pixel</field><field name="creator">M&#252;ller, Martina</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores the implications of new photographic and computer technologies that offer the transduction of modalities. The fundamental argument, here, is that such technologies 'change' the process of sense-making resulting in a new asymmetry that informs the visual language of the creative work.
 
 I argue that the processes of language analysis can assist us in the interpretation of multimodal texts and that a digital illustration can be analysed via the theoretical framework 'built' from the first linguistic concepts such as those to be found in the texts of Plato, Aristotle, Augustine and Locke. A semiotic method applied in the context of digital artwork, and developed from the linguistic-semiotic stand-point, is well suited for an examination of the intermodal relations (the relations between layers in a multi-layered image file). By examining the layered structures of my images I demonstrate the evident similarity between the disconnection of the components of the linguistic sign on the one hand and the visual sign on the other hand. The analysis of a digital image, especially created for this purpose, is expanded by an investigation that offers a partial reading from an insider's point of view that involves an image being analysed on the conceptual level. This involves the examination of the primary internal relations between the layers of the image, and on the level of expression, the examination of the primary external relations between the layers and the narrative of the image.
 
 In its deployment the semiotic method I use investigates the existence and the conditions of a space in which the individual readings from the perspective of outsider and insider might be conceptualized and presents a partial reading derived from an outsider's interpretation of the same image. After comparing both readings I arrive at the conclusion that the different texts' modalities have an impact on the degree of the sign components' disconnection. My conclusion, then, is that an outsider who cannot view the image in its multimodal form assigns sign components in a higher degree of disconnection than an insider who has access to the intermodal relations of the image file.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/219/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marriage, migration and the international marriage business in Japan</field><field name="creator">Nakamatsu, Tomoko</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of the international marriage business in Japan in the 1980s and 1990s, and the experiences of female participants from China, South Korea, and the Philippines who married through this system and currently live in Japan.
 
 The study treats these women as active female migrants and contributes to a gendered understanding of the process of contemporary migration. The thesis argues for an acknowledgement of the way in which the international marriage business served the purposes of marriage and migration for women in male dominant and economically stratified societies in Asia, without downplaying the fact that the same system and its ideology oppresses women. The study argues that, for these women, participation in international marriage by introduction was about marriage and migration. Analysis of the intricate sites of marriage and migration was thus critical to understanding their experiences. The thesis also argues for recognition of the diverse and complex experiences of the women participants.
 
 Part I of this study investigates the macro-economic, social and political factors that influenced development of the international marriage business in Japan. It analyses representations of international introduction marriage and its female participants, and maps the ways in which patriarchal gender ideology in the international marriage business system intersects with global capitalism, and other hegemonic power relations operating in contemporary Japan.
 
 Part II examines the marriage and migration experiences of 45 women. The section identifies conflicts faced by the women and examines processes of negotiation inside and outside the family domain. It investigates the extent of the women's agency in their decision to many and live in a foreign country, covering interconnected arenas of marriage, family, paid work, involvement in women's groups and questions of legal citizenship. The women's narratives demonstrate the importance of articulating a structurally embedded analysis with active female agency in the study of international marriage migration.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/220/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid evolution of diversity in the root nodule bacteria Biserrula plecinus L</field><field name="creator">Nandasena, Kemanthi Gayathri</field><field name="description">Biserrula pelecinus L. has been introduced to Australia from the Mediterranean region, in the last decade due to many attractive agronomic features. This deep rooted, hard seeded, acid tolerant and insect resistant legume species provides high quality food for cattle and sheep, and grows well under the harsh edaphic and environmental conditions of Australia. In 1994, B. pelecinus was introduced to a site in Northam, Western Australia where there were no native rhizobia capable of nodulating this legume. The introduced plants were inoculated with a single inoculant strain of Mesorhizobium sp., WSM1271. This study investigated whether a diversity of rhizobia emerged over time. A second objective was to investigate the possible mechanisms involved in the diversification of rhizobia able to nodulate B. pelecinus.
 
 Eighty eight isolates of rhizobia were obtained from nodules on B. pelecinus growing at the Northam site in August 2000, six years after introduction. These plants were self-regenerating offspring from the original seeds sown. Molecular fingerprinting PCR with RPO1 and ERIC primers revealed that seven strains (novel isolates) had banding patterns distinct from WSM1271 while 81 strains had similar banding patterns to WSM1271. A 1400 bp internal fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced for four of the novel isolates (N17, N18, N45 and N87) and WSM1271. The phylogenetic tree developed using these sequences clustered the novel isolates in Mesorhizobium. There were &gt;6 nucleotide mismatches between three of the novel isolates (N17, N18, N87) and WSM1271 while there were 23 nucleotide mismatches between N45 and WSM1271. 
 
 When B. pelecinus cv. Casbah was inoculated with the novel isolates, five (N17, N18, N39, N46 and N87) yielded &lt;40% of the shoot dry weight of the plants inoculated with the original inoculant (WSM1271). Novel isolates N15 and N45 were completely ineffective on B. pelecinus cv. Casbah. 
 
 Physiological experiments to test the ability of the novel isolates and WSM1271 to grow on 14 different carbon sources (N acetyl glucosamine, arabinose, arbutine, dulcitol, beta-gentiobiose, lactose, maltose, melibiose, D-raffinose, saccharose, L-sorbose, D-tagatose, trehalose and D-turanose) as the sole source of carbon, intrinsic resistance to eight different antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, spectinomycin, streptomycin and tetracycline) and pH tolerance (pH 4.5, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0) revealed that the novel isolates had significantly different carbon source utilization patterns to WSM1271. However, pH tolerance and intrinsic resistance to antibiotics were similar between the novel isolates and WSM1271 except for streptomycin (100 mcg/ml). Novel isolates N17, N18, N46 and N87 were susceptible for this antibiotic while the other novel isolates and WSM1271 were resistant.
 
 Host range experiments were performed for the novel isolates N17, N18, N45, N87, WSM1271 and two other root nodule bacteria (RNB) previously isolated from B. pelecinus growing in the Mediterranean region (WSM1284 and WSM1497) for twenty one legumes (Amorpha fruticosa, Astragalus adsurgens, Astragalus membranaceus, Astragalus sinicus, Biserrula pelecinus cv Casbah, Dorycnium hirsutum, Dorycnium rectum, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Hedysarum spinosissimum, Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus corniculatus, Lotus edulis, Lotus glaber, Lotus maroccanus, Lotus ornithopodioides, Lotus parviflorus, Lotus pedunculatus, Lotus peregrinus, Lotus subbiflorus, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Ornithopus sativus). Only isolate N17 have the same host range as WSM1271 in that they both nodulated B. pelecinus and A. membranaceus, while the other three novel isolates, WSM1284 and WSM1497 had a broader host range than WSM1271. Three isolates N18, N45 and N87 formed small white nodules on M. atropurpureum, in addition to nodulating the above hosts. Isolates N18 and N45 also nodulated A. adsurgens while N45 was the only isolate to nodulate L. edulis. Isolate N87 was the only isolate to nodulate A. fruticosa. WSM1497 nodulated A. adsurgens, A. membranaceus, B. pelecinus and L. corniculatus while WSM1284 was a promiscuous strain that nodulated 16 host species out of the 21 tested. A 710 bp internal region of nifH, a 567 bp internal region of nodA and a 1044 bp internal region of intS were sequenced for N17, N18, N45, N87 and WSM1271. The sequence comparison showed that the sequences of the above three genes of the four novel isolates were identical to that of WSM1271. 
 
 Eckhardt gel electrophoresis revealed that WSM1271, three other RNB isolates from B. pelecinus from the Mediterranean region and isolate N18 each have a plasmid of approximately 500 kb while N17, N45 and N87 are plasmid free. Probing of the plasmid DNA from the Eckhardt gel with nifH and nodA probes indicated that these two genes were not located on the plasmid.
 
 Furthermore, the results of this study demonstrated that 92% of the nodules on B. pelecinus growing in the Northam site six years after the introduction of this plant were occupied by the inoculant strain and the N2 fixation efficiency of the progeny strains of WSM1271 remain similar to the mother culture. This study also showed that the carbon source utilization pattern, intrinsic antibiotic resistance and pH range of the progeny strains of WSM1271 remain relatively similar, except for few variations in carbon source utilization patterns. 
 
 This thesis clearly demonstrated that phenotypicaly, genetically and phylogenetically diverse strains capable nodulating B. pelecinus evolved through symbiotic gene transfer from the inoculant strain to other soil bacteria within six years. The presence of intS, and the evidence of gene transfer between these Mesorhizobium strains indicates that transfer of symbiotic genes may have occurred via a symbiosis island present in WSM1271.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/221/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychic phenomena: meditation, perception actuality: an Australian study</field><field name="creator">Nattress, Emma</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of an investigation into contemporary psychic phenomena as reported by Australian students.

 The study is an empirical one of reported psychic phenomena.

The questionnaire is based on a medical diagnostic model. Its findings are benchmarked against a previous study and compared with other empirical studies.
 
 A comparison of the study's findings with those of more directly religious investigations undertaken overseas in countries with a longer monotheistic religious history than Australia: 
 * provides insight into the Australian attitude, generally recognised as being secular, towards psychic and or spiritual experiences; 
 * indicates that meditation is not necessarily a prerequisite for experience of psychic and or spiritual phenomena; and 
 * argues that commonalities between specific experiences, reported not only within the Australian secular survey but also as reported in the predominantly religious overseas studies, demonstrate that the scientific requirement of repeatability has been met, thus providing ground to believe in the actuality of the reported experiences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/222/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bankruptcy and intellectual property in the People's Republic of China</field><field name="creator">Neelen, Ubbo Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the new system of bankruptcy law in the People's Republic of China.
 
 A major issue of the thesis is the analysis of the possible links and side effects of the upcoming bankruptcy law on intellectual property rights in China.
 
 The fact that the People's Republic of China is one of the fastest growing economies with the intention of becoming accepted as a market economy has various influences upon the political decisions and legal developments in China and the rest of the world.
 
 All changes of the legal environment in China aim at increasing the faith of foreign investors and the growth of foreign investment in China. China continuously allows foreigners to invest in more and more business areas and there is a wide variety of different types of investment in China.
 
 On the one hand, companies have the possibility to invest their capital. On the other hand, companies have the option to invest their technical knowledge. Technical knowledge is of particular interest to Chinese partners. Because of this strong interest, western companies are in great danger of losing their intellectual property. 
 
 The Chinese legal system meanwhile offers western companies a range of different corporate forms. The corporate forms Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise and joint venture in particular are very attractive to foreign investors. Due to the large variety of corporate forms, this thesis focuses on the involvement of foreign investors in a joint venture.
 
 Usually, western companies choose to invest intellectual property in the form of a joint venture. This generates a special need for the foreign company to receive a guarantee for their property. Foreign companies fear that a third party might use their intellectual property and, in order to reduce this risk, they have to be very careful as to how they invest their intellectual property in China.
 
 The new bankruptcy law can create a new form of this well-known threat to foreign companies who invest in the People's Republic of China. The aim of this thesis is to identify some of these new risks and to attempt to find solutions to help foreign investors reduce potential risks for their investments.
 
 Globalisation and international investors are currently focusing on the Chinese market. In order to understand the contemporary situation in China, it is important to understand Chinese history and culture. Taking this into account, this thesis summarises the historical and cultural aspects in the initial chapters.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/223/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The providence of God: a trinitarian perspective</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Haydn D.</field><field name="description">The primary focus of this dissertation is the doctrine of the Providence of God and it is approached from a distinctive perspective - that of the doctrine of the Trinity. Its fundamental thesis is that the adoption of a trinitarian perspective on Providence provides us with a conceptual paradigm in which varying theological emphases, which often divide understandings of Providence, are best understood in a form of paradoxical tension or creative balance with each being correctly understood only in the context that the other provides.
 
 To demonstrate this, it addresses four issues of Providence that have on occasion divided understandings of Providence in the past and which have become significant issues of contention in the contemporary debate on Providence occasioned by a proposal known as Open Theism. These issues concern the nature of divine transcendence, sovereignty, immutability and impassibility and how each should be understood in the context of divine Providence. Through a detailed examination of three recent trinitarian theologies, which have emanated from the three main communities of the Christian church, it argues that a trinitarian perspective is able to provide significant illumination and explication of these identified issues of Providence and of the tensions that are often intrinsic to this doctrine.
 
 In relation to these identified issues of Providence, it affirms tensional truths in our understanding of the issues of Providence and an articulation that necessarily incorporates a binary form of language - that is, utilising language of both-and rather than either-or. In other words, it posits that divine transcendence ought to be held in paradoxical tension with divine immanence; divine sovereignty ought to be held in paradoxical tension with human responsibility; and divine immutability and impassibility ought not to be understood as immobility or impassivity but as affirming the paradoxical tension of active constancy. The articulation of these tensional truths is followed and completed by an examination of how they might be applied pastorally in the specific area of prayer and its relationship to Providence.
 
 Consequently, this dissertation not only constructively impacts our understanding of divine Providence but also significantly advances the contemporary debate on Providence concerning Open Theism.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/224/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complete numerical solution of electron-hydrogen collisions</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, Philip Lindsay</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an extensive computational study of electron-impact scattering and ionisation of atomic hydrogen and hydrogenic ions, which are fundamental to many diverse disciplines, from astrophysics and nuclear fusion to atmospheric physics. The non-relativistic Schrodinger equation describes these collisions, though finding solutions for even hydrogen, the simplest electron-atom collision, has proven to be a monumental task. Recently, Rescigno et al [Science 286, 2474 (1999)] solved this equation in coordinate space using exterior complex scaling (ECS), and presented the first electron-hydrogen differential cross sections for ionisation that matched with experiment without requiring uncontrolled approximation. This method has significant potential for extension to larger collision systems, but its large computational demand has limited its energy range and target configurations, and its application to discrete final-state collisions has been largely unexplored.
 
 Using radically different numerical algorithms, this thesis develops methods that improve the computational efficiency of ECS by two orders of magnitude. It extends the method to calculate discrete final-state scattering cross sections and enhances the target description to include hydrogenic ions and excited initial states. In combination, these developments allow accurate solutions over a broad range of energies and targets, for both scattering and ionisation, including the important near-threshold energy region where accurate calculations have been unavailable. The refined ECS method implemented in this work now offers complete numerical solutions of electron-hydrogen collisions, and its computational efficiency will facilitate its future application to more complex targets. The thesis culminates with the first ab initio quantum mechanical confirmation of ionisation threshold laws for electron-hydrogen collisions [Bartlett and Stelbovics, 2004, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 233201], which have resisted confirmation through the complete solution of the Schrodinger equation for more than half a century.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/225/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro soil-less (IVS) rooting medium</field><field name="creator">Newell, Christopher Jack</field><field name="description">The principle hypothesis of this thesis is that hypoxia, in agar-based media, compromises rooting in vitro. From a practical point of view this is important because most plant tissue culture activities require the material to be successfully acclimatised in a nursery environment. Compromised rooting often results in excessive losses at this stage which are costly and inconvenient. In addition, many plants with commercial and/or scientific interest remain unavailable as they are not able to be rooted and acclimatised reliably. The use of agar as a rooting medium has limited the capacity of plant tissue culture to clonally propagate many plants.
 
 The thesis begins by demonstrating how poorly some plants respond to agar rooting media. Juvenile Chamelaucium hybrid microcuttings were pulsed with IBA 40 mcg M and then placed for 3 weeks on either M1 (1/2 MS) or aerated in vitro soil-less substrate (IVS) (Chapter 2). IVS had 42-82% rooting at the end of Stage 3 compared with 0-1% in agar. Shoot survival for IVS-rooted microcuttings was significantly greater than M1-rooted shoots. Pulsed shoots placed in IVS showed root primordia after 7 days. In contrast, shoots placed in agar showed no root primordia after 21 days and formed callus but did not root when subsequently placed in IVS for a further 4 weeks. The agar medium almost totally and permanently inhibited the capacity of competent shoots to form root primordia and roots.
 
 The effectiveness of different types of aerated and non-aerated media, including IVS, were tested to validate the hypothesis (Chapter 3). Microcuttings from shoot cultures of two Australian plants Grevillea thelemanniana and Verticordia plumosa x Chamelaucium uncinatum were pulsed for 7 days on a high auxin (40 mcg M IBA), agar-solidified medium in the dark. Rooting of the microcuttings was then compared on five experimental substrates: a) standard agar M1 medium (1/2 MS, no hormones, 8 g agar L-1), b) porous-agar medium (1/2 MS, no hormones, 30 g agar L-1, solidified then blended to provide aeration), c) white sand wet with liquid M1, d) white sand with M1 medium containing agar, and e) IVS. A separate experiment involved flushing the IVS soil profile with low or normal oxygen. Low and variable rooting percentages were recorded on the controls on M1 medium. Root induction and average total root length per microcutting at final harvest were significantly higher using the porous media including IVS, blended agar or white sand. The M1 medium and the addition of M1 medium to sand suppressed the percentage rooting and elongation. Flushing the IVS rooting medium with low oxygen also suppressed rooting. The experiments showed that increasing the air-filled porosity of the rooting medium has a positive effect on rooting and this is most likely due to the increased oxygen at the base of the microcutting. The role of ethylene, and the sugar and nutrients in M1 were not investigated.
 
 The efficacy of the IVS protocol on a range of Australian herbaceous and woody species was investigated to determine whether the observed benefits were generic or plant specific (Chapter 4). Improved rooting in IVS compared to agar was shown for 28 Australian species and genotypes from the families Liliaceae, Haemodoraceae, Myrtaceae, Thymelaeaceae, Proteaceae, Goodeniaceae and Rutaceae. Twenty-seven of the 28 species rooted in IVS medium at equal or better rates than in M1. In three cases - Actinodium cunninghamii, one of the Pimelea physodes genotypes and one of the Eriostemon australasius genotypes - shoots did not root in M1 but showed good root development in IVS medium. With few exceptions average root length and number in microcuttings rooted in IVS was superior to those in agar medium.
 
 To further test the resilience of the hypothesis, it was tested on nodal microcuttings of lentil which are recalcitrant to root in vitro (Chapter 5). The veracity of a published conclusion that inverted lentil microcuttings (with their base in the air) root better because of their altered polarity was also examined. It was found that, as is the case for many species, roots initiated and grew only at the proximal end of the microcutting regardless of its orientation. When the proximal end was in agar (a hypoxic environment) the rooting percentage was low (9-25%) even when the orientation of the microcutting was altered by inverting the culture tube. In contrast, when the proximal end of the microcutting was in an aerobic environment (from the shoot being placed upside down in agar medium or placed normally or upside down in an aerated medium) rooting percentages were higher (62-100%).
 
 Given that Stage 2 microcuttings are prepared with the objective to root and acclimatise them to nursery conditions, the duration of this activity becomes important as it can impact on plant quality and costs. The pulsing protocol and the length of time that Stage 3 cultures remain in the culture room during the rooting phase is a component of the unit cost of production of each rooted microcutting. Initially a 7-day IBA pulse was used after which the pulsed microcuttings were transferred to IVS to root. Chapter 6 shows that the pulsing period can be shortened to one day or replaced with a single auxin dip while still achieving high rooting percentages and maintaining plant quality. These materials handling improvements go some way to realising the logistical benefits of ex vitro rooting but without compromising the positive influences of hygiene and a stable environment of the in vitro environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/227/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breeding strategies and community structure in an assemblage of tropical seabirds on the Lowendal Islands, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Lisa</field><field name="description">Information about tropical seabird communities is less abundant in the literature than for those that occur at higher latitudes. In research papers examining seabird breeding communities in tropical environments, it has been found that food availability was temporally and spatially variable in comparison to higher latitudes. This environmental variability would be expected to influence the life-history traits of tropical seabird species, and in turn, the structure of the communities in which they occur.  To examine the impact of environmental variability upon the life-history traits and community structure of tropical seabirds, a comparative study of the breeding strategies of three tropical tern species and an outlier, shearwater species was carried out, at the Lowendal Islands, Western Australia (20 degrees 39'52S; 115 degrees 34'44E) between 1996 and 2000. 
 
 Bridled Terns Sterna anaethetus and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters Puffinus pacificus shared the life-history traits of migration or dispersal from the breeding colony and east-Indian Ocean metapopulation when not breeding, a summer breeding schedule, nest-site fidelity, concealed nest-sites, clutch size of one, offshore and pelagic foraging regime, and protracted post-natal growth.  Crested Terns Sterna bergii and Lesser Crested Terns Stern bengalenis bred within the same colony and shared the life-history traits of presence at the breeding colony when not breeding, an autumn breeding schedule, change in colony site each season, open dense nest-sites, brood size of one. inshore foraging regime (as well as offshore for Crested Terns) and rapid post-natal growth. 
 
 It was found that each species experienced variation in nest-site occupancy and/or colony size, as well as variation in timing of breeding and breeding success between years.  The effects upon each species seemed to operate independently, as concurrently breeding species did not appear affected by the same events, with the exception of cyclones.  Late and/or poor breeding success in a species often coincided with oceanographic changes in the north-west region, such as fluctuations in the strength of flow and temperature of the Leewin Current.  The Leewin Current is a warm water, low salinity current flowing southwards along most of the Western Australian coastline and has a stronger, warmer flow during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Cyclone activity is also influenced by ENSO induced changes in the region's water temperature. Changes in the Leewin Current affected the timing of breeding for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, and feeding conditions for all study species, presumably as a result of changes in prey availability, while cyclone events delayed breeding for Crested Terns and Lesser Shearwaters in the years studied.  Cyclone events were the most obvious cause of re-laying in the case of Crested Terns and Lesser Crested Terns, and breeding failure in the case of Bridled Terns and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters.  Breeding failure was common among later breeders in the Crested Tern colonies.  Breeding success was relatively high for lesser Crested Terns in all years studied, as they hatched and fledged their chicks within the Crested Tern colony among the first wave of breeders.  
 
 There was some overlap in the diets and foraging grounds of the four study species.  Crested terns and Lesser Crested Terns had the most similar diet, however, Crested Terns appeared to be the most opportunistic foragers, with the highest diversity of dietary prey, while Lesser Crested Terns diet consisted of a high proportion of atherinids.  Bridled Terns has the next highest prey diversity, while half the diet of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters in this region, similar to conspecifics elsewhere, consisted of squid.  Wedge-tailed Shearwaters were observed to be offshore and pelagic foragers.  Their distribution in the waters surrounding the Lowendal Islands ranged to the full extent of observation transects(63 Km), and most likely beyond, excluding inshore waters (i.e. within 5 km of islands).  They were not present in the vicinity of the Lowendal Islands when they were not breeding.  Bridled Terns were observed to be offshore foragers, also ranging to the full extent of transects, and most likely beyond, occasionally including inshore waters.  They were rarely observed when not breeding, with the exception of a small number of fledglings at the end of the breeding season.  Crested Terns were observed to combine inshore and offshore foraging grounds, only ranging to the full extent of transects during their breeding season.  Lesser Crested Terns were observed foraging inshore only. 
 
 Chick provisioning, in terms of meal size and frequency, varied between years and within seasons for all species.  It was demonstrated that there were differences in mean corrected meal sizes between years for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, and the same was inferred from chick growth curves for Bridled Terns.  Wedge-tailed Shearwaters provisioned their chicks with larger meal sizes and a higher occurrence of double feeds in 1996/97 than in other years studied.  The amount of time spent feeding chicks in the burrow by Wedge-tailed Shearwaters adults became shorter as the breeding season progressed.  It was demonstrated that all three tern species increased the meal size delivered to chicks as they grew.  Wedge-tailed Shearwaters did not increase meal size as the season progressed, however they did increase feeding frequency.  The feeding frequency of Crested Terns was highest in 1999, nearly doubling that observed in 1997 and 1998.  In 1998 Lesser Crested Terns fed their chicks up to six times more frequently than Crested Terns. 
 
 Chick growth varied for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and Bridled Terns between seasons.  Bridled Tern chicks grew more rapidly in 1997/98, were heavier and reached higher asymptotes for all linear parameters, the exception of wing length, than in 2000.  On the other hand, Wedge-tailed Shearwater chicks grew more rapidly in 1999/2000 than in 1997/98, however, they attained similar asymototes for all parameters in both years.  In the absence of repeat measures of same individuals, Crested Tern and Lesser Crested tern growth was examined using age categorization based on wing and tail feather development.  Both species appeared to attain similar sizes at similar rates in each year.  
 
 Wedge-tailed Shearwaters accumulated weight up to 30% in excess of mean adult weight in all seasons. This is a common trait exhibited in procellarigorms, and some weight loss occurs prior to fledging.  It is suggested, based upon evidence from other studies in which weight loss prior to fledging was found to be water loss, that lipid accumulation acts as an insurance for the period after fledging when young are leaning to forage for themselves.  
 
 The information gathered for this project found no direct evidence of competition among the species comprising the seabird community if Lowendal Islands.  Niche overlap occurred amongst all species, particularly in the case of lesser Crested Terns and Crested Terns, which shared breeding phenology, breeding colonies, foraging grounds and dietary overlap.  Niche overlap also occurred between Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and Bridled Terns, which shared breeding phenology and foraging grounds.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/228/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge production and transfer in physical and life sciences</field><field name="creator">Nicolau, Daniela</field><field name="description">Questions about knowledge flows between different fields of science are important from a policy perspective. This thesis focuses on knowledge transfer between physical sciences and life sciences. Science and technology are increasingly intertwined in a complex continuum. This complexity of the science and technology today asks for a concerted, articulated and comprehensive understanding of the process of science and technology. The approach that this research has taken is to analyse the process of science and technology. The thesis asks: What is the trade of science and technology? In order to answer this question we developed an anatomy of knowledge and we analysed the internal developments in science via the analysis of the role of the researchers as carriers and producers of knowledge.
 
 Secondly the thesis asks: What are the mechanisms and directions on which scientfic knowledge migrates? This research postulates that the analysis of the process of science and technology translates to the analysis of the production and transfer of scientific and technological knowledge.
 
 What is obvious and essential for science and technology is the difference between the specific mechanisms of knowledge production. This thesis suggests that the modem mode of knowledge production is characterized by an increasing density of communication on three levels: between science and technology - on one hand - and society on the other-; between scientific practitioners; and with the entities of the physical and social world. Central to our research is the concept of 'mode of knowledge production ' with mode 1 and mode 2 being defined by Gibbons.
 
 The four case studies employed emphasise on how collaboration across disciplines is highly important for the production of new knowledge. The main characteristic of newly emerging fields in an increasing synergy between disciplines, which leads to several types of communication between them. With the increasing of the interdisciplinary intensity the border between the production of knowledge and the transfer of knowledge begins to be blurred. The transfer of knowledge occurs today at a more conceptual level. It follows that the production of knowledge has a large component of knowledge transfer. To study it, this thesis proposes a quasiquantitative model. In this unified framework for the knowledge transfer mechanisms, transfer is seen as a process with a number of stages and forms. We tested our framework on four case studies.
 
 The third part of the thesis proposes a taxonomy of interdisciplinarity. and deals with the social engineering of knowledge transfer that is the design of adequate guidelines for policies aiming at maximization of knowledge transfer. In this way the thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of processes of development of new emerging scientific fields.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/229/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The electrochemistry of the leaching of pre-reduced nickel laterites in ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution</field><field name="creator">Nikoloski, Aleksandar N.</field><field name="description">A fundamental study was undertaken in order to establish the mechanisms of the leaching of pre-reduced nickel laterites in ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution. Although the process has undergone various improvements since it was first introduced, the total recoveries are still relatively low, averaging at 80% for nickel and 45-50% for cobalt. The lack of sound fundamental information regarding the mechanisms and the kinetics of the dissolution of nickel and cobalt from iron-alloy grains produced by the reduction roasting of lateritic ores is seen as the main obstacle to establishing the reasons for the lack of adequate recovery and to defining alternative processing strategies which would lead to improved extraction and better process optimisation. Based on fimdamental electrochemical studies and bench scale leaching tests, as well as on-site measurements at an industrial plant where this process is applied, the work presented in the thesis introduces significant new evidence and sheds more light on the understanding of the mechanism of the dissolution process and on the reasons for the low extractions of nickel and cobalt.
 
 It has been established that the oxidative dissolution of the iron-alloy grains formed during the reduction roasting takes place primarily via a reaction involving reduction of dissolved cobalt (111) to cobalt (11), and also that the reduction of water is not a significant component of the reactions involved in the dissolution process. Open-circuit potential measurements with various metals and iron-alloys selected to model the reduced material in various solutions which simulated the leaching conditions were also
 
 conducted and revealed that passivation takes place during the leaching process. This brings to light a possible new reason for the low recoveries of nickel and cobalt which has not been previously considered. In addition, a kinetic study was conducted, in which the dissolution rates for the various metals, iron-alloys and solutions were measured as a function of time, and the results of which shed more light on the development of the process of passivation.
 
 The passivation itself is attributed to formation of iron-oxide on the surface of the dissolving iron-alloy grains, which restricts the transfer of electrons to the reduced metal and brings the oxidative leaching reaction to an end. It has been shown that the passivation can occur in two ways.
 
 On the one hand, particularly high concentration of dispersed and dissolved oxygen in the leaching reactors causes passivation by overcoming the limiting current density for the oxidation of iron to divalent iron ions and taking the potential to the region where the direct oxidation to trivalent ions becomes favourable resulting in the formation of an iron-oxide film on the surface.
 
 On the other hand, in normally aerated solutions, the passivation of the dissolving ironalloy grains occurs due to the formation of a cobalt and nickel sulphide layer, as a byproduct of the reduction of thiosulphate on the metal surface, which in turn gradually shrinks the area available for the oxidation of iron, again leading to a situation where the oxidising agents present in the solution under standard aerated conditions become sufficient to shift the mixed potential to the region where the iron-oxide forming reaction becomes favourable.
 
 The presence of thiosulphate has a decisive role in the second type of passivation. What is more, besides preventing further dissolution of the nickel and cobalt locked in the iron-alloy matrix, the loss of nickel and cobalt by precipitation in the presence of thiosulphate can further reduce the recovery of these metals. For this reason, a method was developed for the oxidation and removal of thiosulphate fkom the actual plant liquor.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/230/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology and ecotourism industry of the whale shark Rhincodon typus in North-Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Norman, Bradley  Michael</field><field name="description">The conservation status of the widely-distributed whale shark Rhincodon typus is presently listed as 'Indeterminate - Data Deficient'. One of the main hindrances to obtaining biological data on whale sharks that is relevant to determining its 'conservation status' is that this species has rarely been recorded as occurring in sufficient numbers to obtain quantitative data. However, R. typus does form aggregations at Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), Western Australia, annually between March and June. This has enabled studies to be made of aspects of the biology of R. typus and of the possible impacts of the ecotourism industry on this species.
 
 Using a position provided on vessels involved with the whale shark ecotourism industry at NMP, R. typus was observed on 360 separate occasions in 1995, 1996 and 1997, and it was possible to sex 90.3% of these sharks. The majority of the sexed sharks (84.6%) were male and ranged in length from 4 to 12 m, with a mean of 7.4 m, while the females ranged in length from 4.5 to 8.5 m, with a mean of 6.2 m. The size and degree of abrasion of the claspers was used as an indicator of whether or not a male shark had mated. Using such criteria, it was estimated that male whale sharks start to mature at ca 8 m and that ca 50% are mature by the time they reach 8.6m.
 
 Observations suggested that R. typus feeds by using both suction and flow-through mechanisms. The prey that were observed being ingested included coral spawn, tropical krill, mysids and small jellyfish. The contents of a faecal sample contained parts of the exoskeleton of copepods and the scales of small fishes. The degree of mouth distension, which is assumed to be related to feeding activity, was low during most observation periods.
 
 Photographs of the scars and natural patterning on the skin of individual sharks were used to construct a photographic library for subsequent identification of these sharks. The features used for identifying individual sharks were chosen because they were considered likely to remain for a protracted period. The Whale Shark Photo -identification Library that was produced provides details on the characteristic features of 52 R. typus that were present at NMP. Six individuals were recorded at NMP in both 1995 and 1996, four in both 1996 and 1997, and one in both 1995 and 1997. No identified whale sharks were recorded in all three years.
 
 Rhincodon typus was distributed widely throughout NMP, with most boat and aerial sightings lying within 1 - 2 Ism of the reef crest between Tantabiddi and Turquoise Bay. Rhincodon typus was typically sighted in water depths of 10 to 30 m. The sharks were predominantly travelling parallel to Ningaloo Reef, with significantly more moving in a northward than southward direction. Acoustic tracking of R. typus in 1997 suggested that this species remains within NMP for extended periods and is at the surface for ca 17% of daylight hours.
 
 The number and species of fauna observed to be associated with R. typus were recorded, and a new species of copepod, Pandarus sp. nov., which lives on the skin of R. typus has been described. Golden trevally (Gnathanodon speciosus), miscellaneous trevally (Carangid sp.), remora (Remora sp.) and slender suckerfish (Echeneis naucrates) were common. The prevalence of Pandarus sp. nov. was inversely proportional to the number of Remora sp. and E. mucrates in 1996, while the opposite was true in 1997, suggesting that Pandarus sp. nov. were preyed on by these diskfish.
 
 Rhincodon typus is the basis of the ecotourism industry that operates within NMP each year. While there was considerable variation in the number of tour vessels searching for whale sharks at NMP each year, the greatest mean number of vessels operating per week in successive whale shark seasons were 6.7 during Week 8 (April 19 - 25) of 1995, 6.1 during Week 7 (April 12 - 18) of 1996 and 6.9 during Week 8 (April 19 - 25) of 1997. The greatest mean numbers of whale sharks sighted per week in each year were 5.1 during Week 14 (May 31 - June 6) of 1995,4.2 during Week 6 (April 5 - 11) of 1996 and 4.1 during Week 8 (April 19 - 25) of 1997.
 
 Tourists, who were permitted to swim alongside R. tyus, interacted with sharks for a mean period of 19.3 rnin in 1995, 14.2 min in 1996 and 9.5 rnin in 1997. The reduction in the duration of interaction in three successive years suggests that, over time, R. typus may have become slightly less tolerant of the ecotourism industry at NMP. The mean minimum distance between vessel and shark during each interaction was 20.7 m in 1995, 21.3 m in 1996 and 31.0 m in 1997. The mean minimum distance between tourist and shark during each interaction was 1.5 m in 1995, 2.05 m in 1996, and 2.1 m in 1997. The mean minimum distance of vessel and tourist from R. typus during each individual interaction decreased as the duration of the interaction increased. Therefore, both R. typus and this industry must be carefully monitored to ensure that the impacts of humans are kept to a minimum and thereby ensure that whale sharks return to NMP each year.
 
 An ethology of whale shark behaviours, which included banking, porpoising, diving and eye-rolling, was produced in an attempt to determine whether there is evidence that the ecotourism industry has a negative impact on R. opus at NMP. The frequency of behavioural change was greatest in the first 0 - 5 min of an observation. Eye-rolling by R. typus was recorded as a reaction to flash-photography, while banking was often recorded when SCUBA was used and/or tourists swam beneath the head of the shark. The swimming speed of R. typus at NMP was rarely too fast for tourists to maintain proximity to the sharks.
 
 Several sharks possessed both recent and healed scars, which were probably inflicted by vessel contact. The recent wounds indicate that vessels had caused injuries to R. typus within NMP. These individuals tended to display a higher frequency of avoidance behaviours and reduced interaction times.

The thesis argues that Karl Barth developed his theology with an explicit ecclesial and ethical motive, that is, he developed his theology as a deliberate attempt to shape the ethical life of the church in the context within which he lived and worked. It contends that criticisms suggesting that Barth does not have an ethics are inaccurate assessments of his work, and in fact, that although it is evident that his ethical thought continued to develop throughout his career, major trajectories of Barth's development are present in germinal form even at this early stage.
 
 Following the lead and suggestion of John Webster, the thesis adopts a chronological and exegetical reading of Barth's work from his initial dispute with his liberal heritage circa 1915 until the publication of the second edition of his commentary on Romans. Materials examined from this period include sermons, lectures, book reviews, personal correspondence and biblical commentaries, with particular care being taken to identify the occasion and historical context within which Barth presented his thought. This reading seeks to uncover and present the development, structure, content and logic of Barth's own thought, in hope that the central concerns of this thesis will be validated. Examination of these materials has indeed shown that Barth developed his theology with an ecclesio-ethical motive.
 
 The significance of this thesis is twofold. First, it contributes to broader understanding of Barth's theology both in its early development, and with regard to his ecclesiology and ethics. Second, it provides a significant framework and material for contemporary ecclesial reflection on its own identity and mission.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/232/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ageing in Australia: financial independence and work disincentive issues</field><field name="creator">Ong, Rachel</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates issues central to population ageing in Australia. A principal policy concern is financing the retirement incomes of an increasing number of aged retirees from a shrinking working age population. The investigation has two primary aims. The first is to measure the budgetary savings that alternative social security reforms may yield, and the implications of these reforms for the economic wellbeing of the elderly. The second is to examine how the aged can become more self sufficient through an exploration of the potential role of home equity conversion, an understanding of why the labour force participation of mature age Australians is low, and how labour force participation may be promoted as retirement approaches.   
 
 A microsimulation model is employed to conduct empirical analyses in the context of the new tax system introduced in July 2000. The main microsimulation exercises include measurement of the impacts of potential social security reforms and home equity conversion on the economic well-being of the elderly, and estimation of work disincentive measures, that is, effective marginal tax rates and replacement rates. The Replacement rate estimates are then used in econometric models of labour force participation. Innovative approaches are developed to overcome methodological problems that have prevented the inclusion of replacement rates in previous models.
 
 The major findings are that reforms motivated by budgetary savings can have sizeable adverse impacts on the economic well-being of the elderly. Home equity conversion can promote financial independence, but significant risks are borne by elderly homeowners in those states and regions with less buoyant house prices. Blunt work incentives are experienced by specific mature age socio-economic groups, in particular persons whose partners' incomes help to cushion their economic position on quitting employment. The replacement rate is found to have a significant impact on the participation decision of mature age persons.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/233/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Syntheses of the enantiopure quinones A and A' and their C-1 epimers</field><field name="creator">Oosthuizen, Francois Jacobus</field><field name="description">The 3,4-dihydro-1H-naphtho[2,3-c]pyran ring system is found in many natural products as the 5,10- or 6,9-quinones. These compounds have been synthesized by various research groups as a result of their wide range of biological activities. This thesis describes several investigations directed towards syntheses of compounds in this general area. Quinone A (16) and quinone A'(17), derived from the naturally occurring aphid insect pigments protoaphin-fb and protoaphin-sl respectively, were of particular interest.
 
 The first chapter describes the previous syntheses of some naphtho[c]pyrans including those relating to the aphid pigment derivatives, followed by the isolation and identification of the aphid pigments. Also described was the ability of these naphthopyranquinones to act as potential bioreductive alkylating or dealkylating agents. The latter part of the chapter deals with the syntheses of the racemates of the aphid pigment derivatives quinones A and A' and deoxyquinone as well as model studies toward the non-quinonoid cleavage product, glucoside B. The chapter concludes with the progress made towards the first asymmetric synthesis of these compounds.
 
 Chapter 2 reports the establishment of conditions which led to ortho or para regioselectivity in the intramolecular cyclisation of tethered lactaldehydes to form benzo[c]pyrans. This regioselectivity depended on whether either benzyl or tbutyldimethylsilyl was used as protecting group. This chapter also described a model for the control of stereochemistry leading to quinone A'.
 
 Chapter 3 describes the syntheses of naphthalenes as potential precursors to the naphthopyranquinones derived from the aphid insect pigments. This followed after problems were encountered in previous work with inappropriate protection in the oxidation of halogenated benzopyrans.
 
 Chapter 4 develops the first successful syntheses of enantiopure quinone A and quinine A' with the correct absolute stereochemistry. This involved the regioselective addition of 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-1-methoxybuta-1,3-diene toselectively halogenated benzopyranquinones. The latter were obtained through complementary series of highly diastereoselective transformations based on 2,5- dihydroxyacetophenone as starting material and (R)-lactate from the chiral pool as the source of asymmetry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/234/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sojourn in Paris 1824-25: sex and sociability in the manuscript writings of Anne Lister (1791-1840)</field><field name="creator">Orr, Dannielle</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the day to day practices that constituted Anne Lister's (1791-1840) sexuality and sociability within the range of her writings, as well as her society. Anne's writings were a detailed account, spanning her lifetime, of her own love and relationships with the 'fairer sex' (Whitbread 1988, 145). Anne's sociality, seen in her correspondence and plain handwritten journal entries, has been explored by Muriel Green in Miss Lister of Shibden Hall and Jill Liddington in Female Fortune and Nature's Domain (Green 1992; Liddington 1998; 2003). As a gentlewoman of adequate means, Anne has garnered some attention from women's historians interested in her agency within an early nineteenth century social and historical context. Anne's sexual identity has been extensively analysed over the past nearly twenty years by lesbian feminists, queer theorists, women's historians and historians of sexuality concerned with the history and development of modern Western female homosexuality and gender. The source for theorising Anne's sexuality has been the edited selections of the crypted journal entries, published by Helena Whitbread in I Know My Own Heart and No Priest but Love (Whitbread 1988; 1992). However, many analyses deal either with the theorisation of Anne's sexuality or her sociality; the theoretical difficulty with reconciling these categories has troubled the analysis of her complex subjectivity. Drawing upon the archival materials, I have used an interdisciplinary feminist approach to analyse the sexual and social processes of Anne's everyday interactions in her writings. Taking the seven month period of the sojourn to Paris in 1824-25, I have focused upon Anne's textual practices within her journal volume and letters during her residence in Paris, her social practices with the other guests at the guesthouse 24 Place Vendome and her sexual practices with her lover, the widow Mrs. Maria Barlow. The journal volumes and correspondence are a valuable historical record of one gentlewoman's engagement with early nineteenth century British culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/235/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental education in the workplace: inducing voluntary transport behaviour change to decrease single occupant vehicle trips by commuters into the Perth CBD</field><field name="creator">Baudains, Catherine</field><field name="description">As populations increase and air quality continues to decline in many cities around the world, there is growing recognition that human dependency on car based transport is a serious pollution issue. The potential exists to  change this aspect of human behaviour using environmental education to develop more sustainable transport practices. The application of education strategies to achieve behaviour change in transport mode choice may benefit from an interdisciplinary approach.
 
 This research examined the effectiveness of three different educational strategies in a workplace situation in achieving a shift in transport mode away from the single occupant vehicle. This research aimed to determine if workplace based education interventions that stimulate a deeper level of learning, and encourage self-regulated learning and reflective practice, are more likely to achieve positive behaviour change than interventions based on more superficial learning. A secondary aim was to determine if the characteristics or type of workplace influence the effectiveness of particular education strategies. The research focuses specifically on people's perceptions of transport behaviour and air pollution.
 
 The research examined the effectiveness of three workplace based interventions which aimed at reducing the use of single occupant vehicles (SOV) for commuting to work resulting in an increase in the use of green transport (alternatives to the SOV). The primary goal of the three educational interventions was to achieve an increased awareness, development of positive attitudes and increased empowerment regarding sustainable transport choices. Based on a combination of environmental education and self-regulation of learning theory it was theorized that achieving the three afore mentioned educational outcomes would be highly likely to result in a change in behaviour.
 
 The three interventions differ in level of participant involvement, while the information and structure of each intervention was controlled as much as is possible in a naturalistic study. The intervention designs were based on educational theories including cognitivist information processing, Vygotskian/social constructivism, and self-regulation of learning. The first intervention provided information to participants impersonally with no additional support. The second intervention incorporated a volunteer to model pro-environmental behaviour, facilitate discussion of issues, and aid in planning commute trips using alternatives to the single occupant vehicle. The
 third intervention included the formation of a green transport planning group within the workplace which aimed to identify and address barriers to using alternative transport in the workplace through the development of a green transport plan.
 
 In the naturalistic workplace setting, mixed methodologies (qualitative and quantitative) were employed to examine the relative effectiveness of the three interventions in terms of participants knowledge about, attitudes towards and behaviour (action) in regard to transport, as well as changes at an organizational level. Multiple case studies and surveys were used to collect data about employee transport behaviour, attitudes, and knowledge in 13 workplaces situated in the central area of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, before and after a period of intervention. To allow comparability between workplaces in terms of organisational structure and function six of the 13 workplaces were selected to examine in detail,one government and one engineering organization in each of the three intervention groups.
 
 It was found that the level of knowledge about car use and air quality was increased in all three intervention groups, suggesting increased involvement does not improve the chance of increasing knowledge. In contrast, significantly more positive attitudes to car use and air quality issues were developed in only the two most involving interventions, suggesting information distribution alone is unlikely to influence attitude. There were no changes in the general environmental attitudes across the intervention groups. Single occupant vehicle trips were significantly reduced in the second intervention group only. An overall significant increase was reported for self efficacy (as a measure of empowerment) but no significant change was reported for any particular intervention group. At an organizational level the third intervention resulted in the greatest organizational change, and it is likely that the measures implemented as a result of the green transport planning process will have an ongoing impact on employee transport behaviour in the participant workplaces.
 
 The effectiveness of each intervention type also varied between workplaces. Structural factors such as design of the work environment, internal mail and email systems, and work hours influenced the delivery of the interventions in some workplaces and qualitative data indicates this may have influenced success. There was also an indication that management involvement and workplace culture were major factors influencing participant perceptions of effectiveness of particular education strategies.
 
 Overall it is concluded that while the second intervention involving leadership (but without participant ownership) achieved the greatest reduction in use of the single occupant vehicle, the third intervention achieved the greatest long-term impact on participants and organizations. As a result the definition of effectiveness is complicated and is dependant on whether preferred outcomes have a short-term or a long-term focus. These findings have implications for the way in which achieving sustainable transport in metropolitan areas is approached, as well as other environmentally sustainable behaviours.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/236/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of four commercial fish species in a seasonally closed estuary</field><field name="creator">Orr, Pia</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to determine the size and age compositions, growth rates, reproductive biology, dietary compositions and mesh selectivity of the King George whiting Sillaginodes punctata, the Australian herring Arripis georgiana, the yelloweye mullet Aldrichetta forsteri and the sea mullet Mugil cephalus in Wilson Inlet. These biological variables were chosen for analysis since the resultant data would be of use for managing these commercially important marine species in this seasonally closed estuary, which is located on the southern coast of Western Australia. Samples of each of the above species were typically collected, in at least every other month between April 1988 and April 1990, by using seine netting and gill netting at several sites, distributed at regular intervals throughout the 48 km2 basin of Wilson Inlet, and by gill netting at one site in each of two tributary rivers. The ages of Sillaginodes punctata, Aldrichetta forsteri and Mugil cephalus were determined using the annuli on scales, whereas those of Arripis georgiana were determined using the annuli on otoliths. The annuli on the above hard structures of the four species were shown to be formed annually before they were used for aging purposes. Although at least four year classes of each species were found in Wilson Inlet, the 0+ year class of none of the species was well represented in this estuary. The paucity of this age class was probably attributable, in most cases, to the spawning grounds of these species being located some distance away on the lower west coast of Australia. However, the absence of any 0+ S. punctata in one year was attributed to the mouth of Wilson Inlet being closed at a crucial time, which thereby prevented the recruitment of this species into this estuary.
 
 Virtually all of the S. punctata caught in Wilson Inlet were less than the LSo at first maturity, which implies that none of this species return to this estuary after they have emigrated to sea, matured and spawned. However, appreciable numbers of each of the other three species were found at lengths greater than their respective Lsos. There was clear evidence that large A. forsteri tended to leave the estuary soon after the bar at the estuary mouth was breached. In contrast, length-frequency distributions indicated that large A. georgiana often tended to remain in the estuary, even when they exceeded the LSo at first maturity and the estuary mouth was open. The maximum lengths attained by S. punctata, A. georgiana, A. forsteri and M. cephalus were 491,373,430 and 525 mm, respectively, while the maximum ages attained by these four species were 5+, 7+, 5+ and 4+, respectively. While there was no significant difference between the growth rates of the two sexes of either S. punctata or M. cephalus, the overall growth rates of the females of A. georgiana and A. forsteri were both greater than those of their males.
 
 Each fish was assigned a maturity stage using the criteria of Laevastu (1965). The maximum maturity stage recorded for the gonads of S. punctata was IV (maturing). The fact that no S. punctata with spawning (stage VI), spent (stage VII), recovering spent (stage VIII) or resorbing gonads were found provides overwhelming evidence that this whiting species neither spawns in Wilson Inlet nor returns to this estuary after it has spawned at sea. Furthermore, spawning and recently-spent gonads were never found in individuals of either A. georgiana, A. forsteri or M. cephalus, whch implies that these species also do not spawn in the estuary. However, some A. georgiana and A. forsteri with recovering spent gonads were found in Wilson Inlet, which indicates that some individuals of these two species enter the estuary after spawning at sea. There was no indication that this also applied with M. cephalus. Yet, the gonads of some individuals of this latter species and also of A. georgiana contained resorbing gonads, i. e gonads that had reached a reasonably advanced stage, but not maturity, and which were now undergoing regression. The fish with these gonads had presumably been trapped in the estuary at the time their gonads were developing and could not therefore emigrate out to their marine spawning areas.
 
 The dietary compositions of the four species were shown to be significantly different. Sillaginodes punctata and A. georgiana fed mainly on benthic macroinvertebrates, while all but the smallest M. cephalus were detritivores and A. forsteri was an omnivore. Furthermore, S. punctata fed mainly on errant polychaetes and nemerteans, whereas A. georgiana ingested decapods, mysids and other teleosts. The diets of each species underwent size-related changes. The differences in dietary compositions among and within species would reduce the likelihood of inter- and intraspecific competition for food resources. Comparisons have been made between traditional methods for estimating the selectivity of S. punctata, A. georgiana, A. forsteri and M. cephalus in gill nets and a new method of analysis developed (with Dr. N. Hall), which incorporates the best features of the traditional methods.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/237/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human impacts on Australian sea lions, Neophoca cinerea, hauled out on Carnac Island (Perth, Western Australia): implications for wildlife and tourism management</field><field name="creator">Orsini, Jean-Paul</field><field name="description">Over the last 15 years, pinniped tourism has experienced a rapid growth in the Southern Hemisphere, and particularly in Australia and New Zealand where at least four sites attract more than 100,000 visitors per year. Tourism focused on the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), a protected species endemic to Australia, occurs in at least nine sites in South Australia and Western Australia. Australian sea lions haul out on several offshore islands in the Perth region.
 
 Carnac Island Nature Reserve is one of the main sites where people can view sea lions near Perth, either during recreational activities or on commercial tours.
 
 This study sought: (1) to investigate the potential impact of human visitors on Australian sea lions hauled out on Carnac Island, (2) to consider implications of the results for the management of Carnac Island Nature Reserve, and (3) to examine under which conditions tourism and recreation around sea lions can be sustained in the long term.
 
 Sea lion numbers, rate of return to the site, behavioural response to human presence and incidents of disturbances of sea lions by visitors were recorded over a period of four months on Carnac Island. A survey of 207 visitors was also carried out.
 
 Findings indicated that there were two main types of human impacts on the sea lions:
 * A specific state of sea lion vigilance induced by low level, but ongoing, repetitive disturbances from human presence, sustained at various approach distances ranging to more than 15 m, vigilance that is different from the behaviour profile observed in the absence of human disturbance,
 * Impacts resulting from incidental direct disturbances of sea lions by visitors from inappropriate human recreational activities or from visitors trying to elicit a more 'active' sea lion response than the usual 'sleeping or resting' behaviour on display; these impacts included sea lions retreating and leaving the beach, or displaying aggressive behaviour.
 
 Impacts on sea lions from these disturbances may range from a potential sea lion physiological stress response to sea lions leaving the beach, a reduction in the time sea lions spend hauling out, and, in the longer term, the risk of sea lions abandoning the site altogether. Repeated instances of visitors (including unsupervised young children) approaching sea lions at very short distances of less than 2.5 m represented a public safety risk.
 
 Results also indicated that (1) the numbers of sea lions hauled out and their rate of return to the beach did not appear to be affected by an increase in the level of human visitation (although longer-term studies would be required to confirm this result); and (2) there appeared to be a high turnover rate of sea lions at the site from day to day, suggesting that there are frequent arrivals and departures of sea lions to and from Carnac Island.
 
 The visitor survey indicated that many visitors to Carnac Island had a recreational focus that was not primarily directed towards sea lion viewing ('incidental ecotourists'). Although many visitors witnessed incidental disturbance caused by humans to sea lions, they did not seem to recognise that they themselves could disturb sea lions through their mere presence. Visitors also seemed to have a limited awareness of the safety risk posed by sea lions at close range. Visitors expressed support for the presence of a volunteer ranger on the beach and for more on-site information about sea lions. Finally, visitors indicated that they greatly valued their sea lion viewing experience. It is anticipated that the continued increase in visitation to Carnac Island from recreation and from tourism will result in intensified competition for space between humans and sea lions. Long-term impacts of human disturbances on sea lions are unknown, but a physiological stress response and/or the abandonment of haulout sites has been observed in other pinniped species.
 
 The findings of this study highlight the need to implement a long-term strategy to reduce disturbance levels of sea lions by visitors at Carnac Island to ensure that tourism and recreation around sea lions can be sustained in the long term.

 It begins with a summary journey into the concepts of the postcolonial, presenting some of the challenges with which the concept has been confronted finding nonetheless it enabling as an 'anticipatory discourse' in appreciating the literatures from once-colonised nations such as Australia and South Africa.
 
 I then take a cursory look at the concept of myth while focussing on how writers like Sam Watson and Barney, Mtwa and Mbogeni put such cultural myths as the Biamee deity in The Kadaitcha Sung and the second coming of Jesus in Woza Albert! to use.
 
 In the next section, I focus on how the writers Mudrooroo (then Colin Johnson) in Australia and Mda from South Africa confront and reconstruct some of the historical myths upon which European colonialism was founded, using the texts, Dr Wooreddy's Prescription for Enduring the Ending of the World and The Heart of Redness.
 
 The achievement of this thesis has simply been one of the canonical expansions recommended of postcolonial criticism; the stressing an appreciation of the differences that exist even when postcolonial writers seek to achieve the same goal with their literatures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/239/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and characterization of rickettsiae in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Owen, Helen Clare</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to address the shortfall in current, in-depth knowledge of Western Australian rickettsiae investigating in particular, the role of native and feral animals as reservoir hosts.  Two novel species of rickettsiae were detected in ticks collected from native and feral animals and humans, these were characterised using molecular methods.  A preliminary investigation into the pathogenic potential of one of the isolates was also undertaken.
 
 To facilitate investigation, ectoparasites (principally ticks) were opportunistically collected from across the State, with an emphasis on native and feral animals and people. All ectoparasites were screened for rickettsial infection using a polymerase chain reaction incorporating Rickettsia-specific citrate synthase gene (gltA) primers. Preliminary sequencing was performed on representative PCR-positive samples from each geographical location, vertebrate host and ectoparasite in order to identify and characterize the infecting rickettsia. Isolation in cell culture and further genotypic characterization was then performed. Finally, a serosurvey and questionnaire were implemented in one of the study areas to determine whether people were being infected with a Rickettsia spp. and whether infection was associated with clinical signs. 
 
 Ectoparasite collection produced three genera of ticks (Ixodes, Amblyomma and Haemaphysalis) from native animals, feral pigs and people, primarily from the southwest of Western Australia and Barrow Island in the Pilbara region. Ticks from a number of sources were shown to be infected with rickettsiae by the PCR, including feral pigs, people, bobtail lizards, kangaroos, bandicoots, burrowing bettongs, common brushtail possums and yellow-footed antechinus. Genotypic characterization of positive amplicons from ticks revealed the presence of two novel spotted fever group rickettsiae. Rickettsia gravesii sp. nov., named in honour of Dr Stephen Graves, was identified extensively throughout the southwest of the State and on Barrow Island in Ixodes, Amblyomma and Haemaphysalis spp. ticks from multiple hosts. Candidatus Rickettsia antechini was detected in Ixodes spp. only from yellow-footed antechinus in Dwellingup.  In addition, a novel Bartonella spp. (Bartonella sp. strain Mu1) was also detected from Acanthopsylla jordani fleas collected from yellow-footed antechinus in Dwellingup.
 
 Rickettsia gravesii sp. nov. is most closely related to the Rickettsia massiliae subgroup of the spotted fever group and to R. rhipicephali in particular.  Sequence similarities between this novel species and the subgroup were 99.7%, 98.4%, 95.8% and 97.4% based on its 16S rRNA, gltA, ompA and ompB genes respectively. 
 
 Candidatus Rickettsia antechini also demonstrated a close relationship to the R. massiliae subgroup (99.4%, 94.8% and 97.1% sequence similarity based on its gltA, ompA and ompB genes respectively). The two novel Western Australian species demonstrated 98.4%, 96.3% and 96.7% sequence similarity to each other based on gltA, ompA and ompB genes respectively indicating separate species. The novel Bartonella spp. (Bartonella sp. strain Mu1) detected in fleas collected from yellow-footed antechinus in Dwellingup demonstrated greatest gltA gene sequence similarity to Bartonella strain 40 at 86.1%.
 
 Results from the serosurvey and questionnaire-based investigation into the zoonotic importance of R. gravesii sp. nov. on Barrow Island supported the results of the tick study and suggested that a tick-borne rickettsia(e) was infecting people on the island. However, a significant association between seroconversion and a history of symptoms consistent with a rickettsiosis was not found, and it is possible therefore, that R. gravesii sp. nov. produces only asymptomatic infections.
 
 Future work on rickettsiae in Western Australia will involve phenotypic characterization of the novel species, further investigation of their epidemiology and pathogenicity and an ongoing search for additional undiscovered species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/240/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence, severity and possible causes of canker disease of Corymbia calophylla (marri) in the southwest of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Paap, Trudy</field><field name="description">The impact of a canker disease of Corymbia calophylla (marri) in the southwest of Western Australia (WA) has increased substantially since it was first observed causing decline and death of this species in the 1970s. By the early 1990s there were expressions of concern and calls to determine the cause and management options. Despite this, there has been very little research into the incidence, severity and possible causes of the disease. There are, however, historical reports dating back to the 1920s of a canker disease of amenity planted C. ficifolia caused by Sporotrichum destructor, though the diagnosis and Latin description were never published. It has been suggested that there may be links between this species and the genus Quambalaria, a group containing leaf and shoot pathogens of species of Eucalyptus and Corymbia.
 
 This study examined the incidence and symptomology of the disease, the range of fungal species associated with healthy and diseased C. calophylla, and the pathogenicity of isolates obtained from these surveys. Also investigated was the identity of the pathogen, S. destructor, historically attributed to canker disease of C. ficifolia, to determine whether this pathogen is responsible for the current epidemic of C. calophylla canker and if it is synonymous with Quambalaria.
 
 Cankers were present on trees across the range of surveyed sites, with lesions occurring on trunks, branches or twigs of 25.7 % of the C. calophylla surveyed. Canker incidence was significantly greater on trees present at remnant sites, such as roadsides and in paddocks, than forest trees being 38 % and 13.3 %, respectively. Tree height, trunk diameter at breast height and crown position, size and health ratings were significant predictors of canker presence, with cankers more common on larger, older trees and trees with poor crown condition. Bark cracks exuding kino were present on 48 % of the surveyed trees, and when dissected, lesions were observed on 40 %, suggesting that these cracks could be the initial stages of canker disease. This was confirmed by the observation of a number of cracks that developed into perennial cankers during the three year study. Monitoring of canker development and the examination of transverse sections showed the circumvention of host defenses by the pathogen and the subsequential walling off response of the host (which typifies perennial cankers) was not necessarily an annual event, with no change observed in some cankers over the three year period, while others progressed rapidly in that time, occasionally to the point of girdling and killing the host.
 
 Initial surveys isolated 44 fungal species from healthy and diseased C. calophylla, with opportunistic pathogens including Endothiella eucalypti and Cytospora eucalypticola common. Subsequent surveys foccussed more on a potential pathogen in the genus Quambalaria, which was rarely isolated from active lesions, presumably because of its slow growth rate, but which sporulated consistently on the surface of older sections of the cankers.
 
 DNA sequences confirmed that Q. cyanescens and Q. pitereka are present in southwest WA, with the latter associated with leaf and shoot disease. A third and new species of Quambalaria was isolated from cankers. Comparisons of disease symptoms and conidiogenesis indicate this species is synonymous with S. destructor. The species is formally described here as Q. coyrecup T. Paap sp. nov.
 
 A pathogenicity trial was unsuccessful in causing disease symptoms in trees inoculated with core plugs taken from canker lesion margins of diseased trees, though the time frame and environmental factors may not have been adequate for disease development. The core plug inoculation method may also have failed because opportunistic pathogens which were frequently isolated from lesions out-competed Q. coyrecup (paralleling the results achieved by culturing from lesions). Quambalaria coyrecup caused symptoms matching those observed in natural infections when suitable hosts were inoculated, confirming it is the fungus responsible for the current canker disease of C. calophylla and C. ficifolia. Endothiella eucalypti also caused significant lesions, though these were not typical of natural infections, which together with its frequent isolation from both healthy and diseased trees suggests it is an opportunistic pathogen, potentially contributing to disease development in trees already infected with Q. coyrecup.
 
 Isolates of Q. pitereka from WA and eastern Australia both caused typical shoot blight symptoms in the WA hosts C. calophylla and C. ficifolia, and the eastern Australian host C. maculata, though a larger path trial is required to examine the possibility of host specificity. Quambalaria cyanescens was non-pathogenic in all inoculation trials.
 
 The current cause of cankers in C. calophylla is now known to be the same as the fungus historically implicated in the canker disease of C. ficifolia, when at the time it was described as an endophyte doing little or no damage in C. calophylla. Thus, it is of immediate importance to determine the factors driving this decline, and develop control and management options.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/241/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of APOBEC3G and deoxythymidylate kinase genetic diversity on HIV-1 hypermutation and response to treatment</field><field name="creator">Pace, Craig Stuart</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses two important topics in HIV-1 medicine; (i) the clinical relevance of pre-treatment G-A hypermutation and the contribution of host and viral genetics to its development and; (ii) the influence of genetic variation in host enzymes responsible for antiretroviral drug metabolism on response to therapy. These themes are outlined below.
 
 HIV-1 Hypermutation
 At present, limited data exists regarding the relative roles of host encoded cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F in promoting G-A hypermutation of HIV-1 proviral DNA in vivo, nor the clinical relevance of hypermutation or the influence of genetic diversity of the APOBEC3G locus and of the viral encoded vif protein that counteracts the action of APOBEC3G. The analyses contained within this thesis demonstrate that within the WA HIV cohort, clinically relevant hypermutation is restricted to a minority of individuals and is mediated predominantly by APOBEC3G. In this study, the presence of HIV-1 hypermutation had a substantially greater effect on plasma viremia than other known host antiviral factors such as CCR5D32 or specific HLA-B alleles. Furthermore, the considerable genetic diversity of the vif gene is likely to make a greater contribution to the development of hypermutation than the limited genetic diversity of the APOBEC3G gene in Caucasians. These data indicate that G-A hypermutation is a clinically relevant phenomenon and may provide a fresh perspective to the area of HIV/AIDS therapies.
 
 Genetic Determinant of HIV-1 Treatment Response
 Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and thymidylate kinase (dTMPK) are rate limiting enzymes for the metabolism of the antiretrovirals d4T and AZT, respectively, and are thus central to the antiviral efficacy and toxicity of these agents. However, the genetic diversity of TK2 and dTMPK and their influence on toxicities associated with their use is largely unknown. The results discussed in this thesis indicate that in contrast to the highly conserved TK2 locus, the dTMPK locus of Caucasian individuals, including regulatory regions potentially influencing transcription and translation, is considerably polymorphic and organised into five common haplotypes. The results regarding the contribution of dTMPK genetic variation to toxicities associated with AZT therapy are encouraging. A common dTMPK haplotype had significant, albeit modest, effect on haematological parameters (haemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume) in HIV-infected patients, although no AZT-specific treatment effect was observed in this relatively haematologically stable cohort. In addition, another common dTMPK haplotype provided significant protection against AZT-induced adipocyte mtDNA depletion in a pilot study of AZT- and d4T-treated individuals. The dTMPK haplotypes characterised in this thesis should facilitate further studies regarding dTMPK genetic variation in HIV-1 infection and response to treatment, which are warranted from the clinical results presented herein.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/242/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spurning yearning and learning Aboriginality: ambivalence shaping the lives of non-Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="creator">Palmer, David</field><field name="description">Much academic work concerned with social and cultural processes in Australia takes as its field of inquiry how the lives of Aboriginal Australians have been changed and impacted on by colonisation. Rarely has scholarship attempted to uncover some of the ways Aboriginality and Aboriginal people have become integral in the shaping of the lives of non-Aboriginal Australians.
 
 Ths thesis takes to heart the challenge of subjecting oneself and one's own social and cultural position to the rigours of sociological scrutiny and sets out to examine how crucial Aboriginality and Aboriginal people have been in shaping the lives, identities and economies of non-Aboriginal Australians.
 
 Drawing on the work of Homi Bhabha the thesis argues that ambivalence, whch underlies much of colonial discourse, can have a tremendously disruptive and unsettling effect on the authority, identities and everyday social lives of non-Aboriginal people. The thesis explores something of the diversity of this ambivalence by focusing attention on five groups of people (One Nation Supporters, retired tourists, 'alternative lifestylers', governmental workers and early colonists); two historical moments(early colonial times and the late 1990s); and two regions (the south-west and Kimberley of Western Australia).
 
 The thesis argues that one of the effects of ths ambivalence is that the social worlds of non- Aboriginal Australians are often subjected to challenge and change. In early colonial times many 'settlers' were tom between the will to colonise and economic and cultural reliance on the efforts and knowledge of Aboriginal people. More recently, One Nation supporters attempt to distance themselves from Aboriginal people by constituting them as the barbaric and parasitical other. At the same time, Hansonites indirectly position Aboriginality as central to their own identity and political future. Another group, retired tourists, regularly perpetuate old colonial tropes and publicly express their disdain of Aboriginal people. At the same time, these people yearn for and engage in social practices otherwise associated with Aborigrnal culture. Behind both groups' public attacks on Aborigines as cannibals and the 'Aboriginal Industry' as spongers lies a deep political and cultural reliance on Aboriginality. Romantics and others who aspire to consume and mimic Aboriginal culture are likewise regularly ambivalent and contradictory in their treatment of Aboriginality. It is arguable that many are selfinterested and seek to plunder Aboriginal cultural. However, the very romance that prompts their mimicry can and does act to unsettle the certainty of non-Aboriginal dominance. This prompts people to re-examine their identities and social practices. Ambivalence and complexity is also central to the lives of those involved in the business of Aboriginal governance. On the one hand, these people are clearly implicated in the government and regulation of Aboriginal people. On the other hand, liberal discourse on fairness and equality of opportunity force governmental workers to increase their contact and reliance on Aboriginal people. This often has the effect of provoking changes in non-Aboriginal people's personal and working lives.
 
 The thesis concludes that the engagement of colonial discourse with Aboriginalities inevitably leads to an ambivalence that disables the monolithic dominance of non-Aboriginal Australians. In a range of ways this ambivalence can and does produce conditions whch undermine and transform the cultural lives and identities of non-Aboriginal Australians.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/243/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of research on Codex Bezae, with special reference to the Acts of the Apostles: evaluation and future directions</field><field name="creator">Panten, Kenneth</field><field name="description">Considering the amount of material written on Codex Bezae down through the centuries a detailed history of research into the codex has long been overdue. Such a history is important not only to give future researchers an understanding of what has gone on before,. but also to facilitate an understanding of the development of ideas and their outcome. As Codex Bezae is the principal witness of the so-called Western text, much of what has been written centres upon its text. Nevertheless from the end of the last century there has been a growing awareness among scholars of the need to give the other details contained within the codex far more attention than hitherto.
 
 Inasmuch as the D text is the main rival to the Alexandrian text as the best representative of the otiginal exemplar, it is of no surprise that Codex Bezae and its text have been of interest to the textual critics. Over the last century and a half there have always been those advocating the supremacy of the D text, and such claims have attracted much attention. For this reason, Codex Bezae has never been far from the focus of scholarly debate. This debate would be greatly helped if Codex Bezae could be accurately located historically, for this, briefly, is the nub of the problem - where and when was it written? Any avenue of inquiry ever pursued, any investigation ever embarked upon, has the answer to this question as its prime objective. Hence the importance of this history, for we need to know how the debate has progressed if we are to avoid repeating previous fruitless enterprises and if we wish to build upon previous fruitful endeavours.
 
 Having established the history of research on Codex Bezae it was opportune to assess the claims and counterclaims, to sift the data, and to separate the more factual evidence from the many hypotheses, in order to establish a solid base from which to launch future inquiries.
 
 Consequently this thesis provides:
 1. a detailed history of the research on Codex Bezae;
 2. an analysis of the existing evidence;
 3. a detailed catalogue of scholars who have contributed to the debate;
 4. details of my own investigations into the historical use of unusually spelled words in the Bezan text; and
 5. suggested avenues for future research.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/244/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inland saline aquaculture: overcoming biological and technical constraints towards the development of an industry</field><field name="creator">Partridge, Gavin</field><field name="description">Secondary salinisation has rendered over 100 million hectares of land throughout the world, and over 5 million hectares in Australia, unsuitable for conventional agriculture. The utilization of salinised land and its associated water resources for mariculture is an adaptive approach to this environmental problem with many potential economic, social and environmental benefits. Despite this, inland mariculture is yet to develop into an industrial-scale, rural enterprise. The main aim of this study was therefore to identify and address some of the technical and biological limitations to the development of an inland finfish mariculture industry. 
 
 Three technical aspects essential to the development of an Australian inland mariculture industry were reviewed; potential sources of water, the species suitable for culture in these water sources and the production systems available to produce them. Based on factors such as their quantity, quality and proximity to infrastructure, the most appropriate water sources were deemed to be groundwater obtained from interception schemes and waters from operational or disused mines. In terms of species, mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) were identified as having many positive attributes for inland mariculture, including being temperate and therefore having the ability to be cultured year-round in the regions where the majority of secondary salinity occurs. Seasonal production of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in ponds in the temperate climatic zones has potential, but may be more appropriate for those salinised water sources located in the warmer parts of the country. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were also identified as having excellent potential provided water temperature can be maintained below the upper lethal limit and also have potential for seasonal production, perhaps in rotation with barramundi. In terms of production systems, pond-based culture methods were found to have many advantages specific to inland mariculture. Static ponds enable culture in areas with low groundwater yield and more cost-effective potassium supplementation compared with flow through ponds. Static ponds also largely overcome the issues associated with the disposal of salt-laden and eutrophied waste water; however yields from static ponds are typically low and limited by the nutrient input into the pond. 
 
 In response to the yield constraints of static pond culture, a new culture technology known as the Semi-Intensive Floating Tank System (SIFTS) was designed, patented and constructed in collaboration with the aquaculture industry and tested in a static inland saline pond in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. This technology was designed to reduce nutrient input into ponds by the collection of settleable wastes and to provide large volumes of well-oxygenated water to the target species, to ameliorate the loss of fish from low dissolved oxygen during strong microalgal blooms. The three species identified above has having excellent potential for inland mariculture (mulloway, rainbow trout, and barramundi) were grown in SIFTS held within a 0.13 ha static, inland saline water body (salinity 14 ppt) over a period of 292 days, yielding the equivalent of 26 tonnes/ha/year (total for all three species). Rainbow trout were grown with an FCR of 0.97 from 83 to 697 grams over 111 days (SGR, 1.91%/day) between June and September, when average daily water temperatures ranged from 12.3 degrees C to 18.2 degrees C. Over the same time period, mulloway grew only from 100 to 116 grams, however, once temperatures increased to approximately 21 degrees C in October, feed intake increased and mulloway grew to an average size of 384 grams over 174 days with an SGR and FCR of 0.68 %/day and 1.39, respectively. Barramundi stocked in November with an average weight of 40 grams increased to 435 grams in 138 days (SGR 1.73%/day) with an FCR of 0.90. The SIFTS significantly reduced nutrient input into the pond by removing settleable wastes as a thick sludge with a dry matter content of 5 to 10%. The total quantity of dry waste removed over the 292 day culture period was 527 kg (5 tonnes/ha/yr), which was calculated to contain 15 kg of nitrogen (144 kg/ha/yr) and 16 kg of phosphorus (153 kg/ha/yr). The release of soluble nutrients into the pond resulted in blooms of macro- and micro- algae which caused large and potentially lethal diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen within the pond, however, comparatively stable levels of dissolved oxygen were maintained within each SIFT through the use of air lift pumps. 
 
 It is well documented that saline groundwater is deficient in potassium which, depending on the extent of the deficiency, can negatively impact on the performance of marine species, including fish. The physiological effects of this deficiency on fish, however, have not been previously described. As such, I conducted a bioassay investigating the physiological effects of a hypersaline (45 ppt) groundwater source containing 25% of the potassium found in equivalent salinity seawater (i.e. 25% K-equivalence) on juvenile barramundi. Histopathological examination of moribund fish revealed severe degeneration and necrosis of skeletal muscles, marked hyperplasia of branchial chloride cells and renal tubular necrosis. Clinical chemistry findings included hypernatraemia and hyperchloridaemia of the blood plasma and lowered muscle potassium levels. It was concluded from this study that the principal cause of death of these barramundi was skeletal myopathy induced by unsustainable buffering of blood plasma potassium levels from the muscle. Although such hypokalaemic muscle myopathies have been previously described in mammals and birds, this was the first description of such myopathies in fish. 
 
 It was hypothesized from the results described above that the physiological effects of potassium deficiency are dependent on salinity and that they would be ameliorated by potassium supplementation. These predictions were tested in a subsequent study which measured the effects of potassium supplementation between 25% and 100% K-equivalence on the growth, survival and physiological response of juvenile barramundi at hyperosmotic (45 ppt), near-isosmotic (15 ppt) and hyposmotic (5 ppt) salinities. Unlike those juvenile barramundi reared at 45 ppt and 25% K-equivalence in the previous study, those reared in 50% K-equivalence water at 45 ppt in this study survived for four weeks but lost weight; whereas at 75% and 100% K-equivalences fish both survived and gained weight. Homeostasis of blood plasma potassium was maintained by buffering from skeletal muscle. Fish reared in 50% K-equivalence at this salinity exhibited muscle dehydration, increased branchial, renal and intestinal (Na+-K+)ATPase activity and elevated blood sodium and chloride, suggesting they were experiencing osmotic stress. At 15 ppt, equal rates of growth were obtained between all K-equivalence treatments. Buffering of plasma potassium by muscle also occurred but appeared to be in a state of equilibrium. Barramundi at 5 ppt displayed equal growth among treatments. At this salinity, buffering of plasma potassium from muscle did not occur and at 25% K-equivalence blood potassium was significantly lower than at all other K-equivalence treatments but with no apparent effect on growth, survival or (Na+-K+)ATPase activities. These data confirmed the hypothesis that proportionally more potassium is required at hyperosmotic salinities compared to iso- and hypo- osmotic salinities and also demonstrated that barramundi have a lower requirement for potassium than other marine and estuarine species being investigated for culture in inland saline groundwater.
 
 In addition to ongrowing fish, saline groundwater has potential for hatchery production. Specific advantages include the vertical integration of inland saline farms and the production of disease-free certified stock through isolation from the pathogens and parasites found naturally in coastal water. To determine the potential of utilizing inland saline groundwater for hatchery production, barramundi larvae were reared from 2 to 25 days post hatch in 14 ppt saline groundwater with either no potassium supplementation (38% K-equivalence) or full potassium supplementation (100% K-equivalence). Growth, survival and swimbladder inflation of these larvae were compared against those grown in control treatments of seawater (32 ppt) and seawater diluted to 14 ppt. Those reared in saline groundwater with 38% K-equivalence exhibited complete mortality within 2 days, whilst those held in groundwater with full supplementation survived at a rate equal to both control treatments (pooled average 51.1 plus-minus 0.5%). At 25 days post hatch, there was no significant difference in larval length or dry weight between those grown in the 14 ppt control treatment and those in the saline groundwater with full potassium supplementation. There were no significant differences in swim bladder inflation between any of the surviving treatments (average 93.3 plus-minus 2.5%). This is the first description of rearing barramundi larvae both in low salinity seawater and in saline groundwater, and demonstrates that the requirement for potassium by larval barramundi is higher than for juveniles of the same species.
 
 In addition to a deficiency in potassium, saline groundwater in Western Australia often contains an elevated concentration of manganese relative to seawater as a result of anaerobic reduction of manganese oxides or the pedogenic weathering of manganese-bearing rock. The effects of elevated manganese on marine or estuarine fish have not been described and a study was therefore conducted to determine if manganese, at a concentration typical of that found in saline groundwater, has any impact on fish. The effects of 5 mg/L of dissolved manganese on juvenile mulloway at salinities of 5, 15 and 45 ppt were determined by comparing the survival, growth and blood and organ chemistry with those grown at the same salinities without manganese addition. Survival of mulloway at 45 ppt in the presence of 5 mg/L of manganese (73 plus-minus 13%) was significantly lower than all other treatments, which achieved 100% survival. Those fish grown in seawater without manganese exhibited rapid growth, which was not affected by salinity (SGR = 4.05 plus-minus 0.29%/day). Those fish grown at 5 ppt and 45 ppt in the presence of manganese lost weight over the two week trial (SGR 0.17 plus-minus 0.42 and -0.44 plus-minus 0.83%/day, respectively), whilst those at 15 ppt gained only a small amount of weight (SGR 1.70 plus-minus 0.20%/day). Growth was therefore affected by manganese and by the interaction of manganese and salinity, but not salinity alone. Manganese was found to accumulate in the gills, liver and muscle of the fish. No gill epithelial damage or other significant histological findings were found, however, significant differences in blood chemistry were observed. Blood sodium and chloride of manganese exposed fish were significantly elevated in hyperosmotic salinity (45 ppt) and depressed at hyposmotic salinity (5 ppt) compared with unexposed fish; consistent with manganese causing apoptosis or necrosis to chloride cells. Blood potassium was significantly elevated and liver potassium significantly reduced at all salinities in the presence of manganese. These findings are consistent with manganese interfering with carbohydrate metabolism. There were no differences in blood sodium, chloride or potassium across salinities in fish not exposed to manganese, demonstrating mulloway are capable of efficient osmoregulation across this salinity range.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/245/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching for safe text: transfers on to the infobahn</field><field name="creator">Pasqualini, Rita</field><field name="description">'Searching for safe text' is the main title of the dissertation, and also refers to the process involved in writing (and reading) it. 'Transfers on to the Infobahn' is the subtitle, which applies the guiding metaphor of movement to the central concept of transfer, used to explain potentially unsafe text, and to its application in cyberspace, seen as a further step from off-line experiences.
 
 The research is on difficulties in interaction associated with differences in background languages and cultures, with an increasingly narrow focus on trans-cultural computer mediated communication using written text, mainly in English. The thesis investigates whether and how forms of linguistic interference, particularly negative transfers, lead to unsafe text and serious misunderstandings, which negatively affect interactions.
 
 Aims of the project include increased awareness of the characteristics and problems of both media and messages, and promotion of basic skills and tools to recognise, resolve, reduce and prevent such misunderstandings, to supplement broadly applicable (trans-)linguistic and transcultural communication capabilities. For this research I have collected, analysed, evaluated and compared many relevant examples, which are mostly compatible with online settings, to illustrate problems and promote approaches to their resolution. The most serious outcomes are in areas which impact on basic human needs and values, such as life, liberty and self-esteem, and involving the notion of face, also in the context of linguistic conventions of politeness.
 
 This work brings a lifelong interest in forms of transfer between different languages to the new and rapidly evolving arena of computer-mediated communication, with primary concern for interaction difficulties involving native and non-native users of a supposedly 'common' language. Attention to polyglots, though not exclusive, intends to highlight the often ignored issues of differences in background languages, particularly within the wide and varied English-speaking world. The challenges range from ethical concerns for equity, access and diversity in multicultural societies to economic needs for competitiveness and effectiveness in the international arena.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/246/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Westralian Scots: Scottish settlement and identity in Western Australia, arrivals 1829-1850</field><field name="creator">Beaton, Leigh Sandra</field><field name="description">Before the end of 1850, Scottish settlers in Western Australia represented a small minority group of what was, in terms of the European population, a predominantly English colony.

 While this thesis broadly documents Scottish settlement, its main focus is Scottish identity. Utilising techniques of nominal record linkage and close socio-biographical scrutiny, this study looks beyond institutional manifestations of Scottish identity to consider the ways in which Scottishness was maintained in everyday lives through work, social and religious practices. This thesis also demonstrates the multi-layered expressions of national identity by recognising Scottish identity in the Australian colonies as both Scottish and British. The duality of a Scottish and British identity made Scots more willing to identify eventually as Westralian Scots.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/247/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hepatitis B virus in silvery gibbons (Hylobates moloch)</field><field name="creator">Payne, Karen Louise</field><field name="description">This research investigated a number of issues regarding hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the silvery gibbon (Hylobates moloch). Due to the relatively recent discovery of the virus in nonhuman primate populations, specific knowledge of the biological behaviour of the virus is presently lacking, with current information largely extrapolated from the behaviour of HBV in human infections. In order to manage the captive and wild populations of this critically endangered species, information regarding the behaviour of the virus in gibbons and the likely impact of the viral infection is essential.
 
 The research was performed at Perth Zoo, with the study population consisting of the current and historical members of the zoo's silvery gibbon colony. Because this gibbon species is critically endangered, the study was conducted with minimal intervention to the population with samples collected largely on an opportunistic basis from a small study population.
 
 Review of the history of the virus within the Perth Zoo colony provided epidemiological evidence to indicate vertical transmission in three gibbons (Hecla, Uban and Jury). It would appear that vertical transmission is the primary mode of transmission leading to dispersal of the virus through the captive population of silvery gibbons.
 
 Elevated concentrations of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were found in three gibbons (Perth 2, Uban and Jury), and may suggest a pathogenic role of the virus in this species. Histological examination of the livers of Uban and Perth 2 failed to demonstrate definitive evidence of cirrhosis, however mild fibrosis was seen in both cases and may represent an early stage of liver pathology associated with chronic hepatitis B infection.
 
 The vaccination protocol developed at Perth Zoo was successful in preventing neonatal transmission of the virus from a high infectivity carrier mother in at least two individuals, and was also successful in producing a protective level of immunity against the virus in all three of the individuals tested.
 
 Sequencing of the complete hepatitis B genome from one gibbon (Hecla) revealed that she was infected with GiHV (Gibbon hepatitis B virus), an indigenous strain of HBV previously identified in a number of gibbon species, but not previously confirmed in the silvery gibbon. Hecla's strain of HBV was shown to be more closely related to other nonhuman primate strains of HBV than to any of the human strains of HBV. 100% nucleotide similarity to two of Hecla's siblings indicates that infection in all three animals was the result of vertical transmission from their mother. Partial sequencing of the virus from a second gibbon (Uban) identified another strain of GiHBV which supports the results of the epidemiological study. Neither gibbon showed a high sequence similarity to the virus sequenced from Ivan, the father of the third carrier gibbon (Jury), although only limited sequence data was available from Ivan. Consequently it is likely that at least three different strains of GiHBV are present within the silvery gibbon population.
 
 The information contained in this thesis will assist in the understanding and management of hepatitis B infection in silvery gibbons, as well as the numerous other species of nonhuman primates now shown to be susceptible to this virus.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/248/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School governance: phases, participation and paradoxes</field><field name="creator">Payne, Lesley Irene</field><field name="description">This research analyses the governance structures and processes of thirteen independent primary schools in Perth, and one state primary school in Western Australia termed an 'alternative' or 'lighthouse' school. More in-depth case studies were undertaken at five sites with participants from different time periods. All the schools had a school council or board since their foundations and notably all schools had their origins in the period of the alternative school and community empowerment movement of the 1970s and 1980s. 
 
 In an era of market reform and the corporatisation of schools, the critical areas of focus for this research were: how community expectations and school identity were maintained within council-governed schools; how democratic imperatives compete with professionalism and school improvement issues; and how schools confront dilemmas of governance. Three frameworks, Phases of Development, Community Empowerment and Dilemmas, were employed as useful means to discuss school governance. The results revealed changes in governance over time. Schools began to envisage themselves less as communities and more as businesses. The emphasis was away from parent involvement and towards efficiency and commercial practices. Tensions and dilemmas arose out of these changes.
 
 The thesis concluded that it was not the structures or individuals that were crucial in governance processes but the playing out of particular tensions and dilemmas. Principals and councils have to acknowledge the dilemmas that arise from competing values systems and make choices based on a clear understanding of these dilemmas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/249/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of an outcomes focused approach to education: a case study</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Catherine Rebecca</field><field name="description">Outcomes focused education is an educational reform movement that has influenced many countries, including Australia, in recent years. In this study the case of one primary school in Western Australia is examined.  The study explores how this single school has implemented an outcomes approach within the context of large-scale jurisdictional change.
 
 The research design utilises the qualitative approaches of ethnography and phenomenology to develop a layered case study with the basic unit of analysis being the school site. A number of richly informative case studies, from within this single site, have been developed drawing on data from a broad range of stakeholders including teachers, students, parents and the school's principal. Departmental and school based documents have also been utilised to inform and guide the development of each case study. Emergent themes with respect to the implementation of educational change have been identified and the implications of these are discussed. 
 
 At the time of the study the school site was only in its fifth year of operation, and a variety of key factors were identified as having a significant impact on the level of success achieved in implementation. The change management model as used by the school is identified and described, and several critical areas of weakness are revealed. As a result, the study raises critical questions about the effectiveness of the model used by the school and therefore questions the potential for this model to be used successfully in other schools implementing similar pedagogical change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/250/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher identity in university classrooms: reflexivity and professional learning</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Jane</field><field name="description">Many academics become teachers without the help of formal professional learning. This study explores how a small group of academics have done this. The research aims to uncover the informal, experiential means whereby participants have constructed the knowledge about teaching and learning that underpins their pedagogies. The research begins with the assumption that three key elements play a major role in supporting academics' informal learning about teaching. These are a person's previous experiences of learning, their experience of being part of a particular academic environment and their personal or 'private' theories about teaching and learning, which are experientially based.
 
 Life narratives were collected from a small group of university teachers who participated in qualitative interviews and provided written evidence of their experiences, practices and philosophies of teaching. The research uses an ethnographic, interpretive approach to collect and analyse data in which participants' voices are foregrounded. The researcher's life narratives also form part of the final thesis, demonstrating an 'engaged' approach to research and providing explicit evidence of the researcher's positioning in relation to the subject matter of the thesis. 
 
 The research reveals the importance for participants of a 'teaching self' or consistent identity that develops in early life and continues through to the adult professional context. This identity forms a basis for participants' teaching practices. The challenges experienced by participants when institutional practices do not support or help maintain this identity are discussed, as are the processes whereby participants seek out like-minded colleagues with whom to engage in 'professional conversations' about teaching. The research reveals strong connections between participants' sense of 'self' and the principles underpinning their pedagogies, and the thesis concludes with some suggestions about how the concept of the 'teaching self' might be used to support all teachers engaged in professional learning. Finally, the research advocates 'reflexivity' on the part of teachers, whereby a critical awareness of biography helps locate practice in the cultural and social environment in which it develops.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/251/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carcass and eating quality of sheep grazing saltbush based saline pasture systems</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Kelly L.</field><field name="description">Forage halophytes such as saltbush (Atriplex spp) are being widely used to revegetate Australian saline land and can also provide a medium quality fodder source. There is widespread anecdotal evidence that sheep grazing on saltbush are leaner, tastier and juicer. This thesis investigated the potential to produce a high quality carcass with improved eating quality from grazing sheep on saltbush on saline land.
 
 The first experimental chapter in this thesis details an animal house experiment investigating the carcass, eating and wool quality and physiological responses of sheep ingesting a 60:40 dried saltbush (Atriplex nummularia):barley grain (S+B), ration verses a 33:25:42 lupin grain:barley grain:oaten hay ration (Control, C) for 10 weeks prior to commercial slaughter (Chapter 4). Subsequently, two field experiments were conducted to examine the effects of grazing saltbush on saline land compared to dry senesced pasture on carcass and eating quality of lambs (Goomalling 2003) and hoggets (Wickepin 2004) (both chapter 6) for 14 weeks. Both chapters demonstrated that the ingestion of saltbush resulted in significantly less fat and in the 2 field experiments the ingestion of saltbush resulted in more lean on the carcass compared to sheep grazing a stubble/pasture (control) ration. These are positive findings for processors as costs of fat denudation are high so the lower the fat content and for farmers because less fat is deposited on the carcass per unit of liveweight gain. The decreased deposition of fat was attributed to the higher protein:energy ratio available for production, secondary compounds in saltbush and lower circulating insulin and higher growth hormone of the S+B fed sheep compared to the control fed sheep. Further work is needed to determine if these beneficial improvements in carcass composition can be achieved without compromising animal production. The long term grazing of saltbush did not result in commercially desirable hot carcass weights unless the sheep were supplemented with a high energy source such as barley. The low growth rates are attributed to a decreased availability of energy substrates, low feed intake and increased energy output of sheep fed high salt diets. The low energy intake of the S+B fed sheep also resulted in an a significantly lower percentage of unsaturated fat and unchanged levels of saturated fat in the fat depots compared to the C treatment.
 
 Consumer taste tests conducted on meat from experiments in both chapter 4 and 6 indicated no difference between the treatments for any of the eating quality traits assessed. This can be considered a positive result as sheep can be finished on saltbush without any detriment to eating quality. High vitamin E levels in the meat may have also prevented the development of rancid flavours and aroma. It can be speculated that saltbush does not impart beneficial flavour and aroma volatiles as previously thought; instead the high vitamin E levels inhibit off-flavour and aroma development compared to meat from sheep grazed on dry pasture.
 
 The long term ingestion of saltbush also resulted in significantly lower urine specific gravity (USG), muscle dry matter and higher urine weights suggesting that the saltbush fed sheep had a better hydration status compared to control fed sheep. However, this finding did not correspond with higher hot carcass weight or dressing percentages. The increases in muscle fluid content of the saltbush fed sheep were attributed to changes in body composition. The saltbush fed sheep had a higher lean and lower fat content which corresponded with a greater body fluid content as found in the animal house study.
 
 Under conditions where the body composition of sheep remains the same, the use of short term strategic feeding of components of saltbush was investigated (mimicked in the form of salt and betaine) to reduce dehydration and subsequent reductions in carcass weight and dressing percentages (Chapter 7). Salt and or betaine were fed for 1 week either prior to a 48 h period of water deprivation or prior to 48 h commercial slaughter process where water was available in lairage from 24-48 h. Under both scenarios the diets did not result in improved dressing percentages, hot carcass weights, muscle dry matter or muscle weights. The ingestion of high salt diet prior to slaughter, did increase fluid retention in the extracellular spaces prior to slaughter however by 48 h both groups were at a similar physiological and therefore similar hydration status. Therefore similar levels of fluid were present in the muscles and no difference in carcass weight or dressing percentage could be expected. An important observation from the second experiment was that the high salt group drunk more water than the low salt fed sheep but the low salt group consumed fluid in lairage also. The low salt fed sheep may have been encouraged to drink water after observing the frequent drinking patterns of the high salt group.
 
 This thesis has also shown that saltbush contains high levels of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) (193 mg/kg dry matter). As a result the concentration of alpha-tocopherol in plasma, liver and muscle of the saltbush fed sheep was elevated compared to those grazing dry pasture. The high muscle concentrations of vitamin E in the saltbush-grazed sheep resulted in improved meat colour stability. The high vitamin E levels did not influence the drip and cooking loss of the meat despite a decrease in the muscle dry matter of the meat. The browning of meat and increased drip loss results in large losses to the meat industry due to value deterioration at the supermarket. There is also great potential for the high vitamin E content in saltbush to be used for the prevention of nutritional myopathy instead of using expensive and labour intensive synthetic supplements.
 
 In conclusion, this thesis has provided an insight into the carcass and eating quality of sheep grazed on saltbush based saline pasture systems. The most significant findings were that ingesting saltbush can reduce the carcass fat content, improve meat colour stability and not result in any detriment to eating quality. A potentially useful way to incorporate these results into an Australian farming system may be to use saltbush on a short term basis, not for the length of period grazed in this thesis. The short term use of saltbush should provide sufficient grazing time for an elevation of vitamin E levels in the muscle to improve meat colour stability, increase the amount of lean and decrease fat levels of a carcass all without changing eating quality and decreasing liveweight. Further work is needed to ensure that these benefits can be achieved without compromising animal production. The opportunity to utilise saltbush to produce leaner carcasses with better colour stability may encourage farmers to consider previously unproductive land planted to saltbush to be a highly useful enterprise.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/252/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acculturation differences in family units from former Yugoslavia</field><field name="creator">Pelemis, Ivana</field><field name="description">Focus of on-going cross-cultural investigation has throughout the time shown that inadequate language skills paired with absence of knowledge of cultural practices and norms within the receiving society would create a number of  stress behaviors among immigrants, often manifested as lowered mental health status- depression, anxiety, confusion; feelings of marginality and alienation; psychosomatic symptoms and identity confusion (Berry and Annis, 1988; Greenberg and Greenberg, 1989; Kessler, Turner and House, 1988; Shams and Jackson, 1994; Vega et al., 1986; Vinokur, Price and Caplan, 1991; Winefield, Winefield, Tiggermann and Goldney, 1991). It was further noticed that refugee populations across the world are adapting to the receiving societies in a much slower rate then other migrating groups (Greenberg and Greenberg, 1989), and yet due to sensibilities surrounding research of a refugee population, there are still questions surrounding this process. In addition, it appears that the attempts to demystify acculturation and uncover objective underpinnings of it, has further reduced the current concept undermining validity and reliability of the findings. Therefore need for subjective experience and definition of acculturation, as well as reconsideration of complexity of the phenomenon (acculturation) was recognised by this research.
 
 This study was designed to offer a qualitative insight into the acculturative differences within a family unit among refugees from former Yugoslavia. 21 women, recent refugee- arrivals were requested to participate in the open- end interview. In the semi- structured interview the women were asked to give a detailed account of their personal, their partners' and their children's experiences concerning the emotional, social, economical, occupational and psychological aspects of their and their family- members' acculturation processes. The obtained data was analysed through the means of narrative and Erickson's analytic induction. The results showed that cultural incompatibilities have spread into diverse spheres of living, thus complexity of the acculturation-related problems was acknowledged. The results showed that (1) split families (due to immigration), (2) inability to establish new social ties in the novel environment and (3) decay in professional status were often reported in connection with eroded physical and mental well-being of the participants and their families. The research also looked at cultural diversities, and gender differences, concentrating on concepts of resilience and coping strategies within the acculturative practice. It appears that cognitive restructuring and the ability to let go of the previous lives was the best coping mechanism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/253/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sea turtles and the environmental management of industrial activities in North West Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Pendoley, Kellie Lee</field><field name="description">The nesting demographics of sea turtles using beaches within the Barrow, Lowendal, Montebello (B-L-M) island complex on the North West Shelf of Western Australia were examined in the context of their spatial and temporal distribution and potential for exposure to industrially based artificial light sources. The distribution of overnight turtle tracks throughout the island complex confirmed high density nesting of Chelonia mydas (green turtles) on deep, sandy and high energy beaches and Natator depressus (flatback turtles) on deep, sandy and low energy beaches, while Eretmochelys imbricata (hawksbill turtle) tracks were most visible on shallow, sandy beaches adjacent to near shore coral reef habitat. The three species exhibited a summer nesting peak. Hawksbill turtles commenced nesting in September and continued through to January, green turtles commenced in November and decreased in March. Flatback turtles displayed the most constrained nesting season reported to date in Australia with 86% of the animals visits recorded in December and January only. Nesting population sizes estimated for the three species suggest that on a national scale the B-L-M complex is a moderately large green turtle and a large flatback rookery site. The hawksbill rookery is large on an international scale. While none of the green turtle nesting beaches fell within a 1.5 km radius of industrially based artificial light sources an estimated 42% of nesting flatback turtles and 12% of nesting hawksbill turtles were potentially exposed to these light sources.
 
 Testing of green turtle and hawksbill hatchling response to different wavelengths of light indicate that hatchlings from the B-L-M region respond to low wavelength much like hatchlings tested in North America (Witherington 1992a). Flatback hatchlings displayed a similar preference for low wavelength light however their responses to discrete light wavelengths between 400 nm and 700 nm suggest that this species may not discriminate well between wavelengths that lie between 450 nm and 550 nm. This response may be related to the rapid attenuation of visible light that occurs in the turbid near shore habitats favoured by this species.
 
 Field based arena studies carried out to investigate hatchling behaviour on nesting beaches with light types commonly used in industrial settings found green turtle and flatback hatchlings are significantly attracted to these lights compared to controls. Lights that emit strongly in the low wavelength range (i.e. metal halide and fluorescent) caused hatchling misorientation at lower intensities than the test light that emitted relatively poorly in this range (high pressure sodium vapour). Hawksbill hatchlings tested in situ under the influence of actual oil and gas onshore and offshore facility based lighting were disrupted from the most direct line to the ocean by these light emissions. Emergence fan mapping methods that measure hatchling orientation on nesting beaches were refined and are proposed as an alternative monitoring tool for use on beaches that are logistically difficult to access for large scale experimental orientation studies. The hatchling behaviour was clearly complicated by beach topography and moon phase.
 
 Satellite tracking of post nesting female green and hawksbill turtles from North West Shelf rookeries has identified the Western Australian location of migratory corridors and foraging grounds for these species while Scott Reef turtles migrate from their south Timor Sea rookery to Northern Territory waters. Green turtle nesting on Barrow Island and Sandy Island (Scott Reef) forage at feeding grounds 200 - 1000 km from their nesting beaches. Hawksbill turtles nesting at Varanus Island and Rosemary Islands forage at locations 50 - 450 km from their nesting beaches. While all of the nesting beaches within the B-L-M island complex are protected under the Barrow-Montebello Marine Conservation Reserves, the only foraging ground similarly protected is the Northern Territory foraging ground used by Scott Reef green turtles. None of the foraging grounds used by North West Shelf green or hawksbill turtles is currently protected by conservation reserves.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/254/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A biologically inspired four legged walking robot</field><field name="creator">Peng, Shiqi</field><field name="description">This Ph.D. thesis presents the design and implementation of a biologically inspired four-phase walking strategy using behaviours for a four legged walking robot. In particular, the walking strategy addresses the balance issue, including both static and dynamic balance that were triggered non-deterministically based on the robot's realtime interaction with the environment. Four parallel Subsumption Architectures (SA) and a simple Central Pattern Producer (CPP) are employed in the physical implementation of the walking strategy. An implementation framework for such a parallel Subsumption Architecture is also proposed to facilitate the reusability of the system. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) method was integrated into the CPP to allow the robot to learn the optimal walking cycle interval (OWCI), appropriate for the robot walking on various terrain conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot employs the proposed walking strategy and can successfully carry out its walking behaviours under various experimental terrain conditions, such as flat ground, incline, decline and uneven ground. Interactions of all the behaviours of the robot enable it to exhibit a combination of both preset and emergent walking behaviours.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/255/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The micropolitics of gender at work: leading women in education rocking the boat and moving on</field><field name="creator">Peters, Carole Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the experiences of 21 women in leadership and management who chose to leave their positions in the central office of a large state education department in Australia between 1991 and 2001, despite a record of high achievement and, for most, many years of loyal service. In particular, I identified why the women left and elements of the organisational culture that altered their career directions. The study adds to existing knowledge about women in management in Australia and the phenomenon of 'the glass ceiling' (generally understood to refer to an invisible barrier which prevents women, because they are women, from advancing beyond low to middle levels of organisational management). It demonstrates that the few women who do make it into senior management positions often encounter resistance to their acceptance at that level where the predominantly male managers exclude those who are different. 
 
 Using a qualitative research approach with in-depth, open-ended interviewing techniques drawn from a critical feminist perspective, I worked with the interviewees to explore their experiences as women in organisational management. In combining a phenomenological approach with critical reflection I aimed to create a dialogue on lived experiences while at the same time using theory to inform and reflect on those experiences. My focus shifts back and forth from the women's stories, related in their own voices, to my critical interpretation through a feminist lens, of their life-worlds. 
 
 The sample ranged from women leading projects and special programs to directors, executive directors and chief executives. All, with one or two exceptions, encountered barriers and described gendered micropolitical processes at work. The loss of talent is central to the research. The findings suggest that more could be done to retain women of high potential and, more broadly, to value talented and 'different' individuals who may disrupt the traditional understanding of 'manager' or 'leader'.  
  
 In a profound questioning of the corporate culture the research participants identified the micropolitical processes at work that often blocked career progress. They questioned political game playing, factional politics, unwritten rules, gatekeeping, the exclusiveness of the boys' club, positional power, and the hierarchical and bureaucratic management structure. They observed that relational, inclusive and interactive management styles were not valued in a corporate culture that defined merit in masculinist terms. Many challenged excessive self-promotion and careerist politics; recognised techniques that excluded and marginalised women; and asked why men with mediocre performance records got promotions, often ahead of more qualified, experienced and talented women who worked passionately for 'the good of education'.  
 
 Yet these female leaders recognised that behaviours cannot be divided neatly along gender lines. Many of the interviewees cited examples of a new wave of women they considered had become honorary males, responsible for perpetuating rather than resisting deeply entrenched practices, and not supportive of other women. One experienced CEO, who had worked in a wide range of public sector positions, distanced herself from gender debates and rejected feminist arguments that identified leadership as gendered. Adding to the complexity of the stories, other women at executive level talked of survival, the exhaustion of the lone female, the overwhelming weight of expectations from others (both male and female) and the ethical dimension of working in an 'alien' environment. As the 90s progressed, social justice discourses were lost in the neoliberal agendas of managerialism and economic rationalism and feminist voices were submerged.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/257/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prolonged and continuous heat stress in cattle: physiology, welfare, and electrolyte and nutritional interventions</field><field name="creator">Beatty, David Thomas</field><field name="description">The live export of cattle is an important industry for Australia. Concerns have arisen about animal welfare and in particular heat stress which may cause production losses and death. Cattle shipped live to the Middle East from a southern Australian winter can face continuous and prolonged periods of high heat and humidity as they cross the equator and arrive into a northern hemisphere summer, leading to heat stress and excessive heat load. Some live animal exporters treat heat stressed cattle with electrolyte supplements, but no scientific data exists as to whether this is beneficial to cattle in these unique environmental conditions.
 
 In response to industry's concerns, the experiments described here monitored the physiological responses of Bos taurus and Bos indicus to conditions similar to those experienced by cattle being shipped from southern Australian to the Middle East. Initial experiments were conducted in climate controlled rooms at Murdoch University where intensive monitoring was possible. In the Bos taurus, increases in core body temperature, reductions in feed intake, and increased water intake were measured. There were also changes in blood gas variables consistent with the observed panting causing a compensated respiratory alkalosis. Following the heating period, there were decreases in blood and urinary pH. Bos indicus showed similar responses to the heat, but the changes were less pronounced at the temperatures tested. A pair feeding experiment was conducted to separate the effects of heat from the reductions in feed intake, and this indicated that the major measured effects were due to the responses to heat. On the basis of the measured responses, an electrolyte supplement was formulated and tested on Bos taurus, in the climate controlled rooms, and then on a commercial live export vessel. Results from these experiments indicated improved buffering capacity and a weight advantage for supplemented cattle, even in the absence of extreme heat stress.
 
 A final experiment investigated the effects of amount and quality of roughage in a pelleted feed on core and rumen temperature and feed intakes in Bos taurus subjected to hot environmental conditions in climate controlled rooms at Murdoch University. Both pelleted feeds had approximately the same metabolisable energy and crude protein but differed in content and type of roughage. There were no differences in feed intake, core temperature or rumen temperature between diets. 
 
 This work has led to a greater understanding of the physiological responses of cattle to prolonged and continuous high heat and humidity, the requirements and effects of supplemental electrolytes in these conditions, and the effect of manipulating export diets. The demonstration of advantages in weight and buffering capacity with the electrolyte supplement highlights future areas of research to investigate electrolyte doses, route and types of supplementation, and dietary manipulation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/258/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagnosis, molecular epidemiology and control of avian intestinal spirochaetosis</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Nyree</field><field name="description">Avian intestinal spirochaetosis (AIS) is a condition of laying and breeding hens resulting from colonisation of the large intestine with anaerobic intestinal spirochaetes of the genus Brachyspira. The main causative species in Australia are B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli. Infection with these species can lead to wet litter and reduced egg production. Currently, little is known about how these organisms enter flocks and spread, or how to control them. The economic losses to the poultry industry caused by AIS are thought to be significant, however problems with diagnostic techniques have resulted in this disease often being overlooked.
 
 The major aims of this thesis were to expand understanding of the epidemiology and cycles of transmission of B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli, measure the effectiveness of six disinfectants, develop faster and more reliable diagnostic identification methods, and to investigate effects of diet on colonisation by the spirochaetes.
 
 An epidemiological study on a laying hen farm detected infection with three different Brachyspira species, with multiple strains of these species being present. Infection appeared to have originated from other birds on the site rather than from environmental sources. Experiments showed that B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli survived in chicken faeces for between 2 and 17 hours at 37oC. B. intermedia tended to survive longer than B. pilosicoli, but the maximum survival time for both species at 4oC was only 72-84 hours.
 
 A study was then conducted into the efficacy of some common disinfectants in inactivating B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli. Six disinfectants were evaluated at their recommended working concentrations. All but alkaline salts inactivated two different concentrations of both spirochaete species in less than one minute in the presence of organic matter. Taken together, these results suggest that it should be relatively easy to break the cycle of infection by emptying, cleaning and disinfecting sheds between batches of birds.
 
 To improve diagnostic methodology, a two-step nested duplex PCR (D-PCR) was developed for detection of B. pilosicoli and B. intermedia, using DNA extracted from washed chicken faeces. The new test could provide results within 24 hours of sample receipt, and detected 4-5% more positive faecal samples than selective culture followed by individual species-specific PCRs.
 
 Finally, studies were conducted in experimentally-infected laying hens to investigate potential interactions between diet and colonisation with B. intermedia or B. pilosicoli. In the first experiment, the addition of zinc bacitracin or dietary enzymes to a wheat-based diet reduced colonisation by B. intermedia. In subsequent experiments, it was shown that diets based on wheat predisposed to colonisation with B. intermedia compared to diets based on barley or barley and sorghum. Subsequently, wheat variety Westonia was shown to increase susceptibility to B. intermedia but decrease it to B. pilosicoli, compared to a diet based on wheat variety Stiletto. There was no clear relationship between the soluble non-starch polysaccharide content of a given diet, the viscosity of the digesta in the ileum, or colonization with the spirochaete species. Addition of different dietary enzymes did not significantly reduce the digesta viscosity in the ileum, or significantly influence faecal water content. 
 
 In flocks with persistent problems with AIS consideration should be given to modifying the diet, and, in particular, cereals other than wheat should be used. The wheat variety could be altered, but the addition of dietary enzymes to such wheat-based diets is not particularly reliable as a sole means of controlling AIS.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/259/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of phosphite on disease development and histological responses in Eucalyptus marginata infected with Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="creator">Pilbeam, Ros</field><field name="description">Phosphite is currently used for the management of Phytophthora cinnamomi in native plant communities.

 Spraying the foliage to run-off with 7.5 and 10 g phosphite/L led to the development of severe leaf necrosis within 7 days, with greater than 60% of the leaf area damaged. Moderate phytotoxicity was observed after treatment with 5 g phosphite/L. In planta concentration of phosphite in stems, lignotubers and roots did not differ significantly between applied concentrations of phosphite. 
 
 Stem tissue contained the largest concentration of phosphite at one week after spraying, with approximately 210 and 420 g phosphite/g dry weight detected after treatment with 5 and 10 g phosphite/L, respectively. In a subsequent field trial, the applied concentration of phosphite was found to affect the duration of effectiveness of phosphite in protecting E. marginata seedlings from stem colonisation by P. cinnamomi. Plants were wound-inoculated with P. cinnamomi at 6-monthly intervals after spraying with phosphite. The 2.5 and 5 g phosphite/L treatments were effective against colonisation by P. cinnamomi when inoculated 0 and 6 months after spraying, but only the 5 g phosphite/L treatment inhibited P. cinnamomi within 12 months of spraying. Phosphite had no effect on colonisation by P. cinnamomi when plants were inoculated at 17 months after spraying. The in planta concentration of phosphite detected in the leaves, stems and roots of plants treated with 5 g phosphite/L did not differ significantly between the time of harvest or tissue type at 0.2 and 6 months after spraying. P. cinnamomi remained viable in plants treated with phosphite.Treatment with 2.5 and 5 g phosphite/L when P. cinnamomi was well established in the stems was ineffective at preventing the death of E. marginata.
 
 Between 45 and 89% of plants were girdled on the day of spraying. Spraying plants with 2.5 and 5 g phosphite/L when conditions were less favourable for the pathogen reduced the mortality of E. marginata for up to 10 months.
 
 E. marginata seedlings responded to damage by P. cinnamomi with the production of kino veins and woundwood. Bark lesions were in the process of being sloughed off by 7 months after inoculation in plants that remained alive. In plants of a resistant (RR) clonal line and susceptible (SS) clonal line, phosphite treatment inhibited lesion extension in stems, but lesions did not indicate the amount of stem colonised by P. cinnamomi. The pathogen was isolated from up to 17 cm beyond the lesion front in the RR clonal line. Treatments that reduced the mortality of E. marginata were 5 g phosphite/L in the RR clonal line (RR/5) and 10 g phosphite/L in the SS clonal line (SS/10).
 
 Uninoculated plants were wounded with liquid nitrogen to determine the microscopic responses to injury in the absence of the pathogen. Wound closure was achieved within 21 days of wounding, with callus formation and vascular cambium regeneration. A wound periderm separated wounded tissue from healthy tissue, adjacent to a lignified boundary zone. Two types of phellem were observed - thin-walled phellem (TnP) and thick-walled phellem (TkP). The first-formed TnP layers contained variable-shaped cells, while subsequent layers were more cubical in shape. Multiple TnP layers developed up to 42 days after wounding, with TkP cells sandwiched between the TnP layers. Genotype and phosphite treatment did not affect the wound responses.
 
 Inoculated plants with a restricted lesion extension also formed a wound periderm to separate damaged tissue from healthy tissue. Phosphite treatment stimulated the responses to P. cinnamomi in both clonal lines. Early development of the wound periderm was visible by 6 days after phosphite treatment. It waspreceded by the formation of a ligno-suberised boundary zone in the cambial zone and in phloem parenchyma cells existing prior to injury. Suberin was not detected in the SS/0 treatment. TnP layers completely surrounded lesioned tissue in plants still alive by 24 days after phosphite treatment. Extensive callus production was evident in the SS/10, RR/5 and RR/10 treatments.
 
 Temperature affected the post-inoculation efficacy of phosphite and anatomical responses of E. marginata. At 20 degrees C lesion extension was restricted in both clonal lines of E. marginata, irrespective of phosphite treatment. Greater than 70% of inoculated plants in all treatments produced a ligno-suberised boundary zone at 20 degrees C and between 30 and 70% formed a wound periderm. At 28 degrees C, lesion extension was reduced in phosphite-treated plants at 7 days after treatment. However, lesions continued to extend up to 5 mm per day in the SS clonal line and very few SS plants formed a wound periderm at the lesion front. This contrasted with the strong responses to abiotic wounding observed in uninoculated SS plants at 28 degrees C. The most extensive responses to P. cinnamomi were detected in the RR/5 treatment at 28 degrees C, with a ligno-suberised boundary zone and differentiated TnP of a wound periderm observed in greater than 70% of plants. This treatment resulted in significantly less girdled plants than all other treatments at 28 degrees C, including the RR/0 treatment. At 23 and 24 degrees C, there was no significant difference in acropetal lesion extension or circumferential lesion spread between clonal lines. The inoculation technique and environmental conditions may have resulted in too high a disease pressure for a full expression of resistance in the RR clonal line.
 
 This thesis demonstrates that phosphite has the potential to enhance the resistance of young E. marginata and enable them to survive infection by P. cinnamomi. However, its effectiveness is dependent upon a number of factors, including host resistance, environmental conditions, the applied phosphite concentration and the timing of application.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/260/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">S-wave model in electron-atom collisions</field><field name="creator">Plottke, Christopher Martin</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the theory and presents the numerical solution of the S-wave models of electron-hydrogen and electron-helium scattering.

This thesis questions this interpretation of the traffic problem and its chief policy response: building still more roads. It suggests that in order to effectively analyse Bangkok's traffic predicament and to formulate more sustainable responses to the crisis, an understanding is required of Bangkok's land use and transport development, as well as a systematic and detailed perspective on the similarities and differences between Bangkok and many other cities around the world, particularly those in Asia.
 
 This thesis suggests that Bangkok has passed through three key periods: a water-based transport and walking period, a transport modernisation period and a motorisation period. In each period up to motorisation Bangkok appeared to maintain a harmonious relationship between its high density, mixed use urban form, ideally suited to nonmotorised modes and to public transport. Even in the motorisation period, high density, mixed use development has mostly followed major road corridors and remains well-suited to much higher public transport and non-motorised mode use than currently exist. However, in this period, rapidly rising motor vehicle ownership and use began to come into conflict with the city's pre-automobile form. Road infrastructure could not be built fast enough to keep pace with traffic growth, despite almost exclusive commitment of resources to roads. High capacity public transport systems, including rail, renewed water transport and busways failed to materialise to help curb the motorisation process and to provide much needed relief on the roads. A basic conflict or mismatch between urban form and transport began to emerge, leaving the city ill-equipped to cope with the automobile and subject to large environmental, social and economic impacts from congestion.
 
 The thesis argues that while Bangkok's per capita road supply is low in an international sense, it is not atypical for an Asian city and road availability per hectare is similar to many other cities around the world. Likewise, com mon arguments about an inadequate road hierarchy are systematically analysed and are shown to be insufficient in explaining Bangkok's present crisis. The thesis thus suggests that attempting to tackle the traffic problem through an intensification of road building efforts will not provide the relief sought, but will only exacerbate the traffic impacts which are shown to be already at the limits of international experience.
 
 The international comparison of Bangkok with other cities, highlighting basic similarities and differences in land use and transport features, continues to build upon this argument. It shows that Bangkok lies at one extreme in many transport characteristics such as the amount of travel per hectare, and within the Asian cities, it is very high in vehicle ownership and use and energy use, comparatively low in public transport use and very low in non-motorised modes. The thesis suggests that in physical planning terms, Bangkok's traffic crisis appears to stem from a set of mismatches between its transport patterns, urban form and transport infrastructure. These mismatches are between: (1) vehicle use and urban form: higher levels of private vehicle use than can be properly accommodated in its dense, tightly woven urban fabric; (2) vehicle use and road supply: levels of private vehicle use which are incompatible with its road availability and which are uncharacteristically high compared to other Asian cities; (3) transit use, urban form and road supply: lower levels of overall transit use than would be expected in a city of its urban form and road availability; (4) transit infrastructure, urban form and road supply: a public transport infrastructure which is inadequate to meet the demands for transit movement inherent in such a dense city, particularly a lack of rail infrastructure; (5) non-motorised modes and urban form: levels of non-motorised mode use which are uncharacteristically low for such a dense, mixed use urban fabric. These mismatches are mainly the consequence of a long series of inappropriate and ineffective transport policies and investments which are biased towards private transport and which have at least in part arisen from narrow and outdated transport planning processes.
 
 In order for transport planning in Bangkok to address the suggested roots of the crisis, the thesis contends that at least two key constraints would have to be dealt with: the traditional urban transport planning process and the institutional fragmentation in transport policy and implementation. Notwithstanding, there are forces pushing in the direction of change and these are examined in terms of the growing global and local trends towards sustainability, community outrage over traffic and the role of NGOs. 
 
 Based on these findings, this thesis provides a case for a series of policies to help deal with Bangkok's traffic disaster. In line with global trends towards sustainability as an organising principle for urban policy development, these policies are offered within a framework of developing a more sustainable transport system in Bangkok. The policies suggested cover priority to public transport infrastructure development, transitoriented,mixed land use development, transport demand management, improvement of waterway transportation, facilitation of walking and cycling and institutional reform of Bangkok's transport decision making structure. Opportunities for further complementary research are suggested.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/263/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing the Gorgon: sustainability assessment and policy learning in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Pope, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Sustainability assessment is emerging as a form of impact assessment with the concept of sustainability at its heart. This thesis contributes to the process of theory-building for sustainability assessment through an exploration of the development of this policy tool within the Western Australian context. Through an analysis of the sustainability assessments of the Gorgon gas development on Barrow Island and the South West Yarragadee water supply development, and a process of personal reflection, I explore the potential of sustainability assessment to contribute to a more sustainable society by facilitating learning.
 
 While the focus of traditional forms of impact assessment has typically been 'exterior' forms of knowledge and learning relating to the potential impacts of a proposal, or to process methodologies and governance arrangements, in this thesis I argue that sustainability assessment processes should also facilitate 'interior' forms of learning that excavate and challenge underpinning assumptions about the organisation of society, including shared discourses and storylines, as well as personal views and beliefs.
 
 To achieve this aim, I maintain that sustainability assessment should be a proactive process that is integrated with the proposal development, framed by an open question and guided by a 'sustainability decision-making protocol' that operationalises sustainability for the decision at hand. It should be guided by a structured process framework that assures attention is given to issues that might otherwise be neglected. Each step of the process framework should represent a space for inclusive deliberation, with the concept of sustainability itself acting as a catalyst for learning and reflexivity.
 Located within the institutions of modern industrial society, deliberative sustainability assessment processes can contribute to the emergence of an 'integral sustainability' that embraces and reconnects the interior and exterior, collective and individual dimensions of policy-making and of society in general. The influence of sustainability assessment can thus extend beyond the immediate decision at hand to contribute to a momentum for societal change towards a more sustainable future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/264/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The breeding biology of the flesh-footed shearwater Puffinus carneipes</field><field name="creator">Powell, Christopher D.L.</field><field name="description">The Flesh-footed Shearwater Puffinus carneipes, a 625g ([plus-minus] 3) shearwater, was studied on Woody Island, off the southern coast of Western Australia, from 2000 to 2003, mainly during the chick-rearing phase. Flesh-footed Shearwaters arrive back at their breeding colony at the end of September/early October, dig burrows and court in October, before an unsynchronised pre-laying exodus through November. Eggs are laid in the last week of November, incubated in December and January, and then hatch mid- to late-January. The fledglings depart in late-April/early-May. 
 
 Most nesting burrows were located in areas where soil depth was greater than 350mm ([plus-minus] 14), and were angled into a slope so that the average length was about 1050mm ([plus-minus] 16) long. Burrow activity, monitored with knock-down barricades, peaked around 83-86% of burrows visited nightly in late-October/early-November. Nightly visitation of burrows fell to 8-10% in the third week of November (the pre-laying exodus), and then rose rapidly to around 70% through late-November/early-December as laying commenced. Body mass was high 632g ([plus-minus] 5) during courtship, fell just before the exodus 606g ([plus-minus] 6), then rose again 620g ([plus-minus] 11) upon return. 
 
 Parents incubate their egg alternately, each undertaking a shift of one to eight days. A few days after hatching, the nestling is left unattended by day in the burrow, where it receives a meal weighing 13-18% adult body mass every 1.4 nights, on average, during the 101 days ([plus-minus] 1) it spends there. Flesh-footed Shearwaters are strictly nocturnal visitors to their colony, although nightly proportions of nests entered were not adversely influenced by bright moonlight, climatic or oceanographic conditions. Initially, nestlings received small overnight feeds, but these increased in size and were delivered more frequently as nestlings grew. In consequence, although mean peak body masses attained by nestlings differed significantly between years, after an average period of 66 days ([plus-minus] 2) in the nest young attained masses equivalent to 135-160% mean adult mass. This coincided with deposits of body fat, but carcass analyses of nestlings revealed that a substantial proportion of mass accumulation was attributable to water, particularly as a component of body fat. 
 
 Subsequently, nestlings lost 30-40% of their mass as the time of fledging approached, even though masses of food were generally no smaller, nor delivered any less frequently during this period. Mass recession occurred primarily as a result of water loss, mainly from the integument, but also, substantially from body fat. This is consistent with the view that mass accumulation is related to feather growth. Although the final body masses recorded differed between years, nestlings fledged at around 92-98% mean adult mass, even though they retained a store of body fat. Nestlings continued to be fed to within one to two days prior to departure. The exception was if the peak mass attained was only 800g or less. Individuals in this low peak mass category lost a proportion of body mass similar to heavier chicks and therefore fledged correspondingly lighter than other fledglings. 
 
 It is suggested that parent shearwaters 'over-feed' their nestling so that the peak in body mass coincides with the period of maximum feather growth, and nestling obesity stems from both lipid and water accumulation. The Flesh-footed Shearwater nestling attains a high level of obesity, even though it is fed large meals almost nightly throughout its life ashore, even in poor years. This lends little support to those explanations for nestling obesity in shearwaters that are based upon buffering the young against erratic feeding schedules and long intervals between meals.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/265/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of an integrated process operation management system</field><field name="creator">Power, Yvonne</field><field name="description">This project details the development of a new framework known as the Coordinated Knowledge Management method to enable complete task integration of all low and midlevel tasks for process industries. The framework overcomes past problems of task integration, which made it impossible to have a fully integrated system and with integration being limited to data acquisition, regulatory control and occasionally supervisory control.
 
 The main component of the project includes the use of hierarchically structured timed place Petri nets, which have not previously been used for integrating tasks in intelligent process operations management. Tasks which have been integrated include all low-level tasks such as data acquisition, regulatory control and data reconciliation, and all mid-level tasks including supervisory control and most significantly the integration of process monitoring  fault detection and diagnosis.
 
 The Coordinated Knowledge Management method makes use of hierarchical timed place Petri nets to (i) coordinate tasks, (ii) monitor the system, (iii) activate tasks, (iv) send requests for data updates and (iv) receive notice when tasks are complete. Visualization of the state of the system is achieved through the moving tokens in the Petri net. The integration Petri nets are generic enough to be applied to any plant for integration using existing modules thus allowing the integration of different tasks, which use different problem solving methodologies.
 
 Integrating tasks into an intelligent architecture has been difficult to achieve in the past since the developed framework must be able to take into account information flow and timing in a continuously changing environment. In this thesis Petri nets have been applied to continuous process operations rather than to batch processes as in the past. In a continuous process, raw materials are fed and products are delivered continuously at known flow-rates and the plant is generally operated at steady state (Gu and Bahri, 2002).
 
 However, even in a continuous process, data is received from the distributed control system (DCS) at discrete time intervals. By transforming this data into process events, a Petri net can be used for overseeing process operations. The use of hierarchical Petri nets as the coordination mechanism introduces inherent hierarchy without the rigidity of previous methods. Petri nets are used to model the conditions and events occurring within the system and modules. This enables the development of a self-monitoring system, which takes into account information flow and timing in a continuously changing environment. Another major obstacle to integration of tasks in the past has been the presence of faults in the process. The project included the integration of fault detection and diagnosis a component not integrated into current systems but which is necessary to prevent abnormal plant operation. A novel two-step supervisory fault detection and diagnosis framework was developed and tested for the detection and diagnosis of faults in large-scale systems, using condition-event nets for fault detection and Radial Basis Function neural networks for fault diagnosis. This fault detection and diagnosis methodology detects and diagnoses faults in the early stages of fault occurrence, before fault symptoms propagate throughout the plant.
 
 The Coordinated Knowledge Management method and the newly developed fault diagnosis module were developed in G21 and applied and tested on the Separation and Heating sections of the Pilot plant for the Bayer process at the School of Engineering Science, Murdoch University. Testing indicated that the use of an intelligent system comprising of Petri nets for integration of tasks results in improved plant performance and makes the plant easier to monitor increasing profits. The fault detection and diagnosis module was found to be useful in detecting faults very early on and diagnosing the exact location of faults, which would otherwise prove to be difficult to detect. This would also increase plant safety, reduce wastage and improve environmental considerations of the plant.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/266/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and income generating projects: the gender impacts of Indonesian government policies</field><field name="creator">Prihatinah, Tri Lisiani</field><field name="description">Gender inequality and poverty are two serious problems for developing countries where the majority of women have been victims of the cultural, socio-economic, political, and environmental impacts of development. The gender dimension of poverty focuses on the dilemma of women, their multiple roles as women and their roles in alleviating poverty. The literature on women and poverty abounds with numerous cases and other evidence of women's vulnerability and heavier economic and socio-cultural burden of poverty. Women are also known to be discriminated against in terms of economic safety, lack of basic needs support, work access, opportunities, and payment. Despite these factors, women have a greater sense of responsibility and are more accountable towards sustaining programs designed to alleviate poverty among the poor. In Indonesia, as elsewhere in the world, micro-credit is being used as a major vehicle which serves women for improving their wellbeing, reduce vulnerability, and also as a starter point to empower women. Using findings drawn from a study on the
 
 Indonesian Government policies and the implementation of two particular micro-credit schemes, namely Tabungan Kesejahteraan Rakyat (Takesra) and Kredit Keluarga Sejahtera (Kukesra). This thesis explores the two basic and especially important issues of poverty and women empowerment. Firstly, it views poverty within gender and sustainability perspectives, and secondly, evaluates the impacts of the micro-credit schemes under Takesra and Kukesra. The thesis argues that poverty reduction among women is consistent with the concept of gender and development which is particularly reinforced within the sustainability agenda. The conditions to do so, however, have internal and external constraints strongly manifested in the operation of the micro-credit schemes. The evidence from the empirical research conducted in three districts of Central Java, Indonesia - namely Brebes, Purbalingga and Cilacap - shows the first type of constraints to refer to weaknesses of the schemes themselves, such as incomplete and misdirected indicators for success, small size of available loans and long duration of repayment terms. The second refers to the socio-economic aspects of sustainability, including the economic conditions which do not allow market access to poor women and cultural manipulations which result in overburdens to women. Both diminish the role of the schemes as a poverty solution.
 
 From the analysis and lessons learned from best practices in other countries, it is suggested that the Indonesian Government policies need to be refocuses in order to deal with the internal and external constraints and allow for an advance to be achieved in poverty alleviation and women empowering. The Takesra and Kukesra schemes in a revised form based on the developed new model for micro-credit delivery, should continue to play a role in providing credit to poor women to encourage skill development and capacity building, support the process of women empowerment and potentially contribute towards a more sustainable society.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/268/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translocations of freshwater crayfish: contributions from life histories, trophic relations and diseases of three species in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Beatty, Stephen</field><field name="description">By examining Western Australian freshwater crayfishes, this thesis aims to further our understanding of how life-history strategies, trophic relationships and disease introductions contribute to the threats posed by introduced species. Reproductive and population biology of two species of freshwater crayfish endemic to Western Australia (the marron Cherax cainii and gilgie Cherax quinquecarinatus) and the introduced yabbie Cherax destructor were described. Multiple stable isotope analysis was employed to determine the trophic positions of sympatric populations of C. cainii and the invading. A serious microsporidian disease of freshwater crayfishes was also discovered in a wild population of C. destructor. These data were used to determine the potential threat that C. destructor poses to the endemic crayfishes of Western Australia.
 
 Cherax cainii supports an iconic recreational fishery that has been in steady decline for three decades. It is likely that considerable plasticity in the biology of C. cainii exists amongst the ca 100 populations and that this may result in the current fishery management regulations being not effective in protecting all stocks. To test these hypotheses, the biology of C. cainii were described from populations occurring in an impoundment dam (Lake Navarino) at the approximate centre of its current range and in the Hutt River at the northernmost point of its range and compared with those from a previous study near the southernmost point of its distribution. The study confirmed these hypotheses. For example, the onset of spawning was later in the more southerly Lake Navarino population (August) than in the northerly Hutt River population (July). Furthermore, the respective orbital carapace lengths (OCL) at which C. cainii reached maturity in the two populations studied here differed markedly. The lengths at which 50% of female and male C. cainii matured in Lake Navarino were 32.1 mm and 28.6 mm OCL for females and males, respectively, compared with 70 mm and 40 mm OCL for females and males in the Hutt River, respectively. Therefore, these data clearly demonstrate that the current minimum legal size limit of 76 mm CL (~55 mm OCL) is ineffective in allowing females to undertake a spawning event prior to legal capture. It is therefore recommended that the minimum legal size limit be increased to 98 mm CL in the Hutt River to allow 50% of females to reach maturity prior to exploitation. Furthermore, as the spawning rate of mature female C. cainii in the Hutt River was low (10%) compared with those mature females in the more southerly Lake Navarino (96%), this increase in minimum legal size of capture is of particular importance should fisheries managers wish this translocated population to be exploited sustainably.
 
 It is proposed that the much larger lengths at first maturity and low spawning rate in the Hutt River were due to faster growth rates likely caused by relatively high water temperatures and in response to competition with the sympatric, introduced crayfish, C. destructor, respectively. This highlights the plasticity of the biology of C. cainii and has considerable implications for effective management of the size-regulated recreational fishery.
 
 Cherax quinquecarinatus, a south-western Western Australian endemic: occupies a broad range of aquatic systems, is likely to be an important component to those aquatic food webs, and is also subject to recreational fishing pressure. Cherax quinquecarinatus was found to mature at a relatively small size (cf C. cainii) with the L50s for females and males being 18.8 and 24.5 mm OCL, respectively, with the majority of C. quinquecarinatus first spawning at the end of their second year of life. The potential (ovarian) and pleopodal fecundities of C. quinquecarinatus were relatively low compared to other freshwater crayfishes, being 81.7 (plus-minus 5.93 s.e.) and 77.1 (plus-minus 13.76 s.e.), respectively. Cherax quinquecarinatus underwent an extended spawning period, from late winter to late summer (i.e. August to February). Three spawning events were facilitated by short brood and rapid gonadal recovery periods, traits consistent with other crayfish species able to exist in temporary environments.
 
 The seasonal von Bertalanffy growth curve, fitted for the first 14 months of life for female and male C. quinquecarinatus, had respective K and OCLs of 0.29 and 59.6 mm OCL for females, and 0.25 and 73.8 mm OCL for males, respectively. At 12 months of age, the OCLs of females and males were 14.7 and 14.1 mm, respectively. Estimates of total mortality (Z) were relatively high at 2.34 and 1.95 year-1 based on an age-converted catch curves for females and males, respectively, with a considerable proportion of this attributed to fishing mortality (exploitation rates of 0.76 and 0.75 for females and males, respectively). Cherax quinquecarinatus exhibited traits of both an r- and a K-strategist, which has likely to have aided the success of this species across a wide range of permanent and temporary systems.
 
 During this study, C. destructor was found in many wild aquatic systems in the southern Pilbara and Southwest Coast Drainage Divisions of Western Australia. This is of great concern as all native freshwater crayfishes in Western Australia are restricted to the southwest while the aquatic systems of the Pilbara Division do not naturally house freshwater crayfish.
 
 Despite the reported impacts that invasive freshwater crayfish species may have on native crayfish species and food webs, the biology and ecology of C. destructor in wild systems in Western Australia was unknown and therefore an assessment of their potential impact has not previously been possible. Cherax destructor was collected monthly from the Hutt River (Pilbara Drainage Division) for determination of life-history and reproductive biology in a wild aquatic system in Western Australia. Proliferation in that system was attributed to specific traits including: a small size at first maturity with 50% (L50) of females and males maturing at 21.6 and 26.5 mm OCL, respectively, a size attained at the end of their first year of life; a protracted spawning period (July to January); high mean ovarian fecundity of 210.2 (plus-minus 9.24 s.e.); and a rapid growth rate that was comparable to the larger sympatric C. cainii in this system. Life-history characteristics of C. destructor in the Hutt River were typical of many other invasive crayfish species and were likely to have aided in its establishment.
 
 This study is the first to examine the diet and trophic position of sympatric populations of two species of freshwater crayfish in Australia. By determining temporal changes in the assimilated diet and trophic positions of sympatric populations of C. destructor and C. cainii, this study tested the hypothesis that C. destructor has the potential to compete with C. cainii for food resources. This was tested using multiple stable isotope analyses with samples of C. cainii, C. destructor and a wide variety of their potential food sources analysed in the Hutt River in summer and winter, 2003. Summer samples indicated that these species occupied similar predatory trophic positions when their assimilated diet consisted of a large proportion of Gambusia holbrooki (either when the fish were alive or deceased due to a presumably large natural mortality rate). Although C. cainii continued to assimilate animal matter based on winter signatures, those of C. destructor appeared to shift towards more of herbivorous trophic position. It appeared that C. destructor and C. cainii were keystone species in the Hutt River and were likely to be important in the cycling of nutrients and in structuring the aquatic food web that may have been considerably altered by their introduction into this system.
 
 As C. destructor has the ability to switch trophic positions, when an otherwise abundant, high protein food sources (i.e. fish) becomes limited (as was the case in winter in the Hutt River), it was able to co-exist with C. cainii. Furthermore, the ability of C. destructor to switch from a diet of fish in summer to a predominantly herbivorous/detrital diet in winter suggests that it may compete for food resources with the other smaller native freshwater crayfishes (such as C. quinquecarinatus) in the small, unproductive lotic and lentic systems common to south-western Australia, which often lack fish during summer.
 
 The recently described Thelohania parastaci was identified in C. destructor in the Hutt River and Vavraia parastacida, previously recorded from C. cainii and C. quinquecarinatus populations elsewhere in the region, appeared to be infecting C. cainii. Although not confirmed to have infected C. cainii, the presence of T. parastaci in the sympatric C. destructor is of serious concern as there is the potential that the disease may be able to be transmitted to the native congeners of the region, particularly as C. destructor establishes itself in other natural waterbodies.
 
 This thesis has addressed major gaps in the understanding of the biology, ecology and threats to the unique freshwater crayfish fauna of Western Australia. The results of this research highlight the plasticity of the biology and ecology of freshwater crayfishes and enabled an initial assessment to be made of the potential ecological impacts of an invading species. Considerable implications for fisheries and other natural resource management agencies ensuing from this research are detailed.

Topics covered include allometry of host and Santalum when grown as single plant pairings in both field and pot culture, nutritional interactions between Santalum and beneficial and non-beneficial hosts, deleterious influences of parasitism on plantation productivity and heartwood induction in young trees.
 
 In Western Australia sandalwood is grown in the nursery for 8 months before establishment in the field and during this time a pot host is introduced. Survival of Santalurn after field establishment and its subsequent growth were significantly affected by the time of introduction of the pot host, Alternanthera nana. Increasing the period of the Santalum : Alternanthera association in the nursery to 109 days prior to field establishment markedly increased early growth of Salztalum plantations. Introduction at 134 days prior to field establishment was detrimental to the parasite as the Alternanthera was too vigorous for the small Santalum seedlings. Santalurn plants had a lower root : shoot ratio lower when cultured with Alternanthera in the nursery prior to field establishment compared with seedlings grown without Alternanthera. Alterrzantlzera survival in the field was high when it had been grown with Santalum for 12 weeks or more in the nursery prior to field establishment. After 1 1 weeks in the field a strong negative linear relationship was shown between Santalunz root : shoot ratio and Alternarzthera dry weight, and a positive linear relationship between Salztalum DW and Alternanthera DW.
 
 In Western Australia Santalu~n is established in the field with an intermediate host which nourishes the parasite for 3-5 years before Santalum becomes dependent on its long-term host and the intermediate host dies. The relationship between Santalum and several species tested as intermediate hosts was examined by pairing Santalum seedlings with intermediate host seedlings in 25 litre pots over a 10 month period. Growth of Santalum in pot culture with three N2-fixing woody intermediate hosts (Sesbania forrnosa, Acacia traclzycarpa and A. ampliceps), the woody non N2-fixing Eucalyptus camaldulensis or without a host varied considerably between host treatments. Santalum growth was greater and root : shoot ratio lower for seedlings grown with N2-fixing hosts compared with seedlings grown with E. carnaldulensis or with no host. The root : shoot ratio of unattached Santalum increased exponentially over time, whereas for all other treatments it remained relatively constant. An assessment of the value of the hosts, termed host use efficiency, was computed as Santalum shoot DW / host shoot DW. The host use efficiency of A. trachycalpa was greater than that of the other hosts.
 
 The xylem sap of hosts and Sarztalum, and ethanolic extracts of endophytic tissue of haustoria of Santalzkm were analysed for amino acids, organic acids and sugars to determine which solutes were available in the host and which were extracted by the Santalum haustoria from different hosts. There were similarities between Santalum and legume hosts in concentration and composition of xylem sap amino acids, and in the amino acid spectra of the corresponding Santalum endophytic tissue, whereas there were low N levels in xylem sap of E. camaldulensis and dissimilarities between its amino acid composition and that of Santalum. This indicated substantial direct intake of xylem N by Santalum from legume hosts but little N from the xylem sap of E. canzaldulensis. There were high concentrations of asparagine, glutamate, aspartate and y-amino glutamate in the xylem sap of the legume hosts, while in the non-legume the most common amino acids were glutamate, aspartate, glutamine and arginine. Proline, the predominant amino acid in the xylem sap of Santalum acurninatum growing in natural vegetation (Tennakoon et al. 1997) was not detected or present in very low concentrations in Santalurn album under these conditions. in the non-legume. Xylem sap of hosts contained variable amounts of sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) and organic acids (fumaric, citric and malic acid), whereas that of the parasitic Santalum was dominated by fructose and malic acid. Dissimilarities in the proportional amounts of xylem-borne sugars and organic acids were particularly evident for the E. camaldulensis : Santalum partnership.
 
 Diurnal profiles of photosynthesis and transpiration of Santalum were closely similar to those for corresponding hosts, whereas the midday leaf water potential of Santalum was consistently more negative than that of corresponding hosts. Net photosynthesis and water use efficiency was lower, but transpiration rates were similar to that of corresponding hosts. Nitrogen concentrations of foliage of Santalum were higher than their hosts, and higher when on legume hosts than on E. camaldulensis, or without a host. Nitrogen concentrations of Santalum foliage was strongly correlated with net photosynthesis and water use efficiency of Santalum. 813C values of shoot dry matter of Santalum were poorly correlated with instantaneous water use efficiency of Santalum. Tissue water relations of Santalum were similar to that of water-stress tolerant species.
 
 S. formosa proved the best host followed by Acacia ampliceps and A. traclzycarpa based on dry matter gains of Santalum. Estimates of heterotrophic gain of C of Santalum when grown in association with the legume hosts over a nine week period indicate 57.9% of C was derived from A. ampliceps, 45.5% from A. trachycarpa and 34.6% fiom S. fomosa. Abundance of haustorial attachments on roots of hosts was poorly correlated to Santalum shoot DW. Root nodules of legume hosts were parasitised by a small proportion of Santalum haustoria.
 
 Sodium and phosphorus concentrations of foliage of Santalum were generally higher than that of corresponding hosts. Net gains of calcium, potassium, phosphorus and sodium in Santalum was greatest when grown in association with hosts richest in the corresponding element. Net losses or only small gains of calcium, potassium, phosphorus and sodium were recorded when Santalum was grown with E. camaldulensis or without a host suggesting that Santalum has limited ability for uptake of those minerals through its own root system.
 
 To understand the effect of hosts on the productivity of a Santalum plantation a young plantation of Santalum with three host species Cathormion umbellatum, Sesbania formosa and Acacia anuera was selected to study the relationship between host quality and distance of hosts from Santalunz on Santalum health. The selected plantation showed marked decline in health and vigour of both Santalum and hosts between years 3 and 5. Parameters of the host plants were assessed to select the best predictor of Santalunz crown health. The height and diameter growth increment of Santalum between years 3 and 5 was strongly correlated to Santalum crown health. Santaluin crown health and growth increased as host quality increased, and the distance of host fiom Santalum decreased. An index, which combined host quality and the distance of the host from that of Santalum, was a better predictor of Santalum crown health than host distance or quality alone.
 
 The age at which heartwood is initiated in Santalum album under plantation conditions in Western Australia in unknown, but in natural stands in India it occurs between 10-13 years of age (Rai 1990). A field experiment was conducted to determine the efficacy of stem injections of paraquat andlor ethrel in initiating heartwood formation in five year old Santalum trees in a plantation. Trees injected with paraquat alone had a significantly greater extension of induced heartwood, both radially and vertically, than those trees injected with ethrel alone or distilled water. Eight months after treatment with paraquat or ethrel or a combination of these chemicals induced heartwood was formed, which had high lipid, and low starch and polysaccharide concentrations compared to the sapwood. Induced heartwood from both chemical treatments and their combinations contained total volatile oil and santalol oil (alpha and beta santalol) concentrations that were equal to or greater than that of naturally formed heartwood and greater than that of sapwood. Moisture content, and concentrations of K and Mg, and in some treatments Ca of induced heartwood were significantly lower than that of sapwood. The thesis concludes with a synthesis of the findings and suggestions for future research, with special reference to mid-rotation aspects of Santaltrm plantation silviculture.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/270/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tide weavers project</field><field name="creator">Raffaele, Julie</field><field name="description">The Tide Weavers Project examines the representation of landscape in motion picture films and explores the ways in which certain filmmakers closely reference the desert landscape to mirror and represent notions of self and consequently, to shape film character portrayal. I argue that these filmmakers use this setting to describe a particular relationship for themselves and their characters. In this relationship the desert becomes a space in which to project and examine aspects of self and it can initiate a transaction or relationship so intimate that at many points, (human) being becomes landscape, and landscape becomes being. I will draw on the work of a range of Philosophers and Postcolonial theorists to inform my reading of this relationship and to frame my engagement with specific Australian and international films. The inclusion and analysis of my own desert-based motion picture script Tide Weavers will add to my understanding of the possibilities of film (as a medium) provides for altering an audiences' reading of landscape. I challenge the notion of estrangement from the land, either though ignorance or where colonialist landscape theory detracts from a sense of connectedness, such as through the superficial or subjective application of cartography, fear arising from monotonous and unfamiliar geography, and the eroticising of land as woman. I engage with current theory surrounding the idea of fusion with landscape to open new opportunities for exploring landscape/character interaction. I also propose that collaborative working processes between indigenous and non-indigenous filmmakers have the potential to alter the ways in which landscape is both represented and interpreted. I then look at how these ideas are translatable to the themes of the Tide Weavers script. Grief and gender are primary themes, with an emphasis on how respite, sacred space and surrender to landscape can lead to healing. I believe this work will contribute to exciting new filmic interpretations of landscape theory.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/271/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the recommendation architecture model for text mining</field><field name="creator">Ratnayake, Hemali Uditha Wijewardane</field><field name="description">The Recommendation Architecture (RA) model is a new connectionist approach simulating some aspects of the human brain. Application of the RA to a real world problem is a novel research problem and has not been previously addressed in literature. Research conducted with simulated data has shown much promise for the Recommendation Architecture model's ability in pattern discovery and pattern recognition. This thesis investigates the application of the RA model for text mining where pattern discovery and recognition play an important role.
 
 The clustering system of the RA model is examined in detail and a formal notation for representing the fundamental components and algorithms is proposed for clarity of understanding. A software simulation of the clustering system of the RA model is built for empirical studies. In the argument that the RA model is applicable for text mining the following aspects of the model are examined. With its pattern recognition ability the clustering system of the RA is adapted for text classification and text organization. As the core of the RA model is concerned with pattern discovery or identification of associative similarities in input, it is also used to discover unsuspected relationships within the content of documents. How the RA model can be applied to the problems of pattern discovery in text and classification of text is addressed demonstrating results from a series of experiments. The difficulties in applying the RA model to real life data are described and several extensions to the RA model for optimal performance are proposed from the insights obtained from experiments. Furthermore, the RA model can be extended to provide user-friendly interpretation of results. This research shows that with the proposed extensions the RA model can be successfully applied to the problem of text mining to a large extent. Some limitations exist when the RA model is applied to very noisy data, which are also demonstrated here.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/272/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the status of porcine circovirus in Australia</field><field name="creator">Raye, Warren</field><field name="description">This thesis reports for the first time the detection of porcine circovirus virus (PCV) in the Australian pig herd.
 
 PCV DNA was detected in the tissues of pigs from several Australian states using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, the primers for which were based on the sequence of PCV1 and PCV2 strains detected in North America and Europe. PCV type 1 or 2 was detected in 80 of 367 (21.7%) pigs tested. In the 80 positives, both PCV1 and PCV2 were detected in 14 samples. Virus was detected in pigs from all states from which samples were obtained: Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland.
 
 The complete genomes of 13 strains of Australian PCV were sequenced. Analysis of the data indicated there was extremely high homology between the Australian strains of PCV1 and PCV2 and previously published sequences of PCV1 and PCV2 strains from North America and Europe.There were no consistent differences between the genome of the Australian strains and strains in North America and Europe.
 
 The widespread occurrence of PCV in the tissues of pigs was confirmed by a small scale serological study of the Western Australian pig herd using an immunofluorescence assay, which did not discriminate antibody to PCV1 and PCV2. This assay detected PCV antibody in 11 of 14 pig herds in Western Australia, with a prevalence rate in positive herds varying from 25 to 47%, but it was unable to differentiate antibody to PCV1 and PCV2.
 
 A PCV2-specific recombinant viral capsid protein was produced in insect cells with a baculovirus expression system and this was used to develop a PCV2-specific ELISA and a Western immunoblotting assay. These assays were applied to samples from a national pig serum bank and detected PCV2 antibody in 33% of 3933 serum samples. The highest seroprevalence to the recombinant PCV2 capsid antigen was detected in the samples from Victoria where there was a 51.3% seroprevalence rate, and the lowest in Western Australia where there was an 11.4% seroprevalence rate.
 
 An in situ hybridisation (ISH) technique was developed for the detection of PCV in tissues of infected pigs and infected cell cultures. A monoclonal antibody specific for the capsid protein of PCV2 was also produced and has application for the development of immunocytochemical procedures for the detection of PCV2 in tissues and cell cultures.
 
 The high prevalence of PCV in the Australian pig herd and the absence of reports of PMWS suggested that the Australian strains of PMWS detected may have been of low virulence. To examine the pathogenicity of Australian strains, two animal experiments were conducted where the type species of PCV1 present in persistently-infected PK15 pig kidney cells and an Australian PCV2 strain were cultured in vitro in cell cultures and inoculated into weaner pigs. As expected, the PCV1 replicated well in pigs but did not result in the induction of clinical signs or lesions in the inoculated pigs. The inoculation into weaner pigs of cell culture replicated PCV2 with an apparent virus titre of 103 virus particles/mL resulted in infection of only some of the inoculated pigs and it was concluded that the PCV2 inoculum contained insufficient virus to infect all pigs into which it was inoculated. The PCV2 did not induce any disease syndrome and could not be visualised in tissue sections of infected pigs using immunohistochemical techniques.
 
 In conclusion, techniques were developed for the detection of PCV in the Australian pig herd. PCV of both genetic types were detected at prevalence rates similar to those reported in other countries where PMWS has occurred, and the widespread occurrence of PCV was confirmed by serological assays. The PCV strains present were genetically indistinguishable from those present in North America and Europe. The reason for the absence of PMWS in Australia is most likely not due to differences in the characteristics of the PCV strains present.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/273/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Universities as learning organizations: how can Australian universities become learning organizations?</field><field name="creator">Reece, Philip David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the research issue of universities as Learning Organization. It examines the research problem of 'How can Australian universities become Learning Organization'? This thesis presents the findings from a qualitative study of two publicly funded universities based in Western Australia, using the convergent interview and multiple case study methodology. The 11 convergent interviews were used to establish the ten key dimensions of what, the researcher considered, are necessary for Australian universities to become Learning Organization. The 32 case studies were then used to confirm or disconfirm these ten key dimensions which are listed below:
 * Leadership
 * Vision
 * Organizational culture
 * Human resource management
 * Role in society
 * Accessibility
 * Resources
 * Innovation and creativity
 * Information Communication Technology
 * Global reach
 
 Of the ten key dimensions examined some, such as leadership, vision, Human Resource Management and having sufficient resources, were found to be clearly important to Australian universities becoming Learning Organization. While others, such as the global reach of a university and the accessibility to a university, presented with less clear findings, but still remain as part of the overall basis for Australian universities to become Learning Organization. The findings presented in this thesis represent the combined views of 32 staff members of two West Australian universities and provide many meaningful insights to the current state of two contemporary West Australian universities; one noted primarily as a research university and the other as primarily a teaching university. Finally, this thesis presents a model of what Australian universities could be, as Learning Organization.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/274/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing curriculum change within a state education department region: analysis and conceptualization</field><field name="creator">Reid, Bryan</field><field name="description">The major aim of this study was to develop a conceptual model representing the implementation process of a curriculum change occurring in a State Education Department region. This development had its genesis in the now extensive body of literature related to the organizational phenomenon of planned change.
 
 Since its early development in the 1960s, the study of planned change occurring in organizations has grown in sophistication, encompassing a steadily evolving number of theoretical constructs. Such a construct, of recent origin, was that of perceiving implementation of the innovation as a discrete process within the total planned change process. Although still in its infancy, this concept has attracted a steadily growing body of research, the present study co-ordinated some of these findings to form the basis for a four-stage model representing the implementation process under a special set of circumstances.
 
 The application of the model was tested under field conditions. A longitudinal case study design was adopted because this was ideally suited to test the assumption of implementation as a process. The design was divided in to four sections : concepts related to the decision to change; concepts related to the effect the rationale for implementation had on teachers' behaviour; concepts related to the sequence of involvement of implementers; and finally, concepts related to the measurement of the degree of implementation for teachers and pupils.
 
 Field work was applied in a rural educational region of the State of Western Australia. This region was established in 1979 as part of an Australia-wide trend. It is well documented that at the commencement of the 1970s, Australian government control led education systems were highly centralized. By the beginning of the 1980s, all were facing major change, each incorporating some form of decentralization. In Western Australia, a shift in power from central authorities to Regional Superintendents occurred. With the increase i n power, the Regions received more duties and became more complex organizations.
 
 To meet the demand of testing a complex theoretical model in the intricate field setting of a State Education Department region, a wide range of data-gathering techniques was used. Questionnaires were employed, some specifically designed to suit this study and some selected from other research. The breadth and depth of the data collected was extended by the use of interviews, both focused and unstructured. Information from a wide variety of perspectives was gathered by using direct observation. This was applied to the testing of the theoretical model and also used to validate data drawn from other sources. Content analysis techniques were also used to triangulate the findings from questionnaire and interview techniques.
 
 The findings of the analysis of the data, within a matrix of hypotheses and sub-hypotheses, provided powerful statistical evidence indicating that the innovation was judged as being implemented by the teachers and the pupils. Data collected were also analysed as part of the research plan incorporating four major hypotheses and twenty six sub-sections. Each sub-section has been investigated empirically. This strategy was used to test the applicability of the conceptual model as a technique to represent the process of implementation followed by an innovation in Oral English introduced into a rural region of a State Education Department.
 
 The model proved to be a very effective device, aiding in the comprehension of an implementation process that occurred under the particular conditions described in the thesis.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/275/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investing creatively in sustainability: cultural capital - the new growth stock of sustainable development</field><field name="creator">Rhodes, Alix</field><field name="description">Sustainability is about ensuring that current and future generations have equal access to resources and a quality of life that provides long-term economic security at the same time as safeguarding the natural and cultural environment. Using a process of sustainable development (SD) it is possible to formulate management tools and planning strategies to change and direct industrial or human activities that are contrary to sustainability. SD requires unified responses to guide this process through a new set of customs and practice, and achieve acceptance and changes in the behavior and actions of individuals and organisations. The outcomes of SD will be determined by the human response to sustainability, which is in part a cultural response.
 
 Culture has a duality of meaning in every day use. It is either the value system that shapes the aspirations, identity and attitudes of individuals and groups; or the 'way of life' for a particular group of people who are drawn together through customs, religion, language, arts, science or technology. Culture has principles in common with sustainability by bestowing upon current generations cultural heritage and identity, as well as responsibility for safeguarding future cultural diversity and ecological balance. This thesis suggests that cultural values are a key to sustainability and that deliberate strategies and criteria are needed for the arts and creative industries to assist SD. The idea that culture is central to SD is based on the fact that sustainability is a concept whereas culture is a human value system and a way of life.
 
 Using the concept of 'cultural capital', this thesis identifies a framework that can guide and report both the tangible economic and physical outcomes and the intangible benefits that occur through artistic and cultural activity. Tangible outcomes include artists, buildings and creative products while intangible benefits lead to cultural identity, diversity and a sense of place. It is then suggested that if a framework based on cultural capital were applied to SD, such a process would be called 'culturally' sustainable development. The idea of culturally sustainable development (CSD) is explored in academic and business literature, and in the practical examples of existing action found in the Western Australian arts and cultural community.
 
 Based on this intelligence, strategies are identified to provide the next steps for developing the concept and practice of CSD. Strategies call for government, business and the arts to have equal responsibility for mainstreaming the concepts of CSD and cultural capital, and encourage CSD activities and projects. At the implementation level, strategies focus on developing a universal framework for CSD, incorporating Creative Action Plans or creative business plans, along with a CSD Index, and a creative cluster approach to project management or industry development. CSD is about investing creatively in sustainability through cultural capital, the new growth stock of SD.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/276/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of the HOX11 target genes ALDH1A1 and FHL1</field><field name="creator">Rice, Kim Lee</field><field name="description">HOX11 is a developmental regulator that plays a crucial role in the normal development of the spleen and is also aberrantly activated by the t(10;14)(q24;q11) and variant t(7;10)(q35;q24) translocations in a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (TALLs). The recent finding that HOX11 is deregulated in up to 40% of childhood TALLs when abnormalities not detected by cytogenetics are included, suggests that the over-expression of HOX11 and subsequent deregulation of downstream target genes are critical events in the progression of this tumour type. To date, three candidate HOX11 target genes have been reported, two of which are Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1a1 (ALDH1A1) and Four and a Half LIM domain Protein 1 (FHL1). This investigation focused on two aspects of HOX11 function, namely its roles as a transcriptional regulator and as a nuclear oncoprotein capable of inducing neoplastic transformation. More specifically, we sought to further understand the role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis by 1) Confirming target gene status of ALDH1A1 and FHL1 by assessing whether their proximal promoter regions are transcriptionally regulated by HOX11, 2) Investigating the regulatory elements/transcriptional complexes involved in the response of ALDH1A1 to HOX11 in both a T-cell and an erythroid cell line in order to gain an insight into the mechanism(s) responsible for mediating a HOX11 activity and 3) Assessing the ability of ALDH1A1 and FHL1 to perturb normal patterns of haematopoiesis, on the basis that the transforming capabilities of HOX11 are thought to derive from its ability to affect haematopoietic cell differentiation.
 
 To confirm ALDH1A1 and FHL1 as target genes, they were both characterised in terms of the ability of their proximal promoters to be transcriptionally regulated by HOX11 using luciferase reporter assays. Significant repression of the proximal promoters of ALDH1A1 and FHL1 by HOX11 was observed in PER-117 T-cells which provided further evidence for their status as target genes. In the case of ALDH1A1, a CCAAT box (-74/-70bp) was identified as the primary cis-regulatory element involved in ALDH1A1 transcription and repression by HOX11 appeared to occur, either directly or indirectly, via interactions at the CCAAT box. Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed the disruption of a specific complex at this site by HOX11, which also altered the formation of complexes at a non-canonical TATA box (a GATA box at -34/-29bp). Significantly, HOX11 was shown to have the potential to interact with TFIIB, a member of the basal transcriptional complex. This, together with the presence of a TFIIB responsive element immediately 5' of the GATA box, suggested that HOX11 may repress transcription by interfering with members of a preinitiation complex on the ALDH1A1 promoter. The transcriptional repression by HOX11 demonstrated in T-cells was dependent on DNA binding helix 3 of the homeodomain, suggesting that repression may require DNA binding. Alternatively, this region may be required for stable protein-protein interactions. In support of this, the in vitro association of HOX11 with TFIIB was disrupted upon deletion of helix 3, and the HOX11 H3 mutant switched from a transcriptional repressor to a potent activator of transcription. Together, this data supports a model whereby HOX11 represses transcription by interfering with activation complexes at the CCAAT box and at the GATA box possibly via protein-protein interactions involving the homeodomain helix 3, whereas deletion of the region disables repressor-specific interactions, resulting in potent activation by HOX11.
 
 Luciferase reporter gene assays investigating the response of nested deletions of the ALDH1A1 promoter to HOX11 in the HEL900 erythroleukaemic cell line, also identified the CCAAT box (-74/-70bp) as the primary cis-regulatory element involved in ALDH1A1 transcription. However, in stark contrast to the its effect in T-cells, HOX11 was shown to activate transcription in the HEL cell line, both from the empty pGL3Basic luciferase reporter vector and from the ALDH1A1 promoter, in a manner independent of the homeodomain DNA binding helix 3. HOX11 thus appears to be a dichotomous regulator, capable of both transcriptional activation and repression depending on the circumstances. The mechanisms underlying these two functions are also appear to be distinct, with repression but not activation requiring the presence of homeodomain helix 3.
 
 ALDH1A1 encodes an enzyme involved in the irreversible conversion of retinaldehyde to the biologically active metabolite, retinoic acid (RA) and appears to be physiologically regulated by Hox11 in the developing spleen. Since RA is a potent modulator of cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, the dysregulation of RA synthesis is likely to have severe consequences for the cell and may constitute a mechanism whereby overexpression of HOX11 predisposes T-cells to malignant transformation. FHL1 also appears to have potential relevance to tumorigenesis, given that it encodes protein isoforms with suspected roles in transcriptional regulation. As a starting point to investigate a possible link between these HOX11 target genes and leukaemogenesis, the effect of overexpressing ALDH1A1 and FHL1 on murine haematopoiesis was assessed following reconstitution of lethally irradiated mice with retrovirally-transduced primary murine bone marrow cells. The enforced expression of ALDH1A1 in bone marrow was associated with a marked increase in myelopoiesis and a decrease in B and T-lymphopoiesis. By contrast, overexpression of FHL1 was not associated with perturbations in myelopoiesis or lymphopoiesis, although a slight increase in erythropoiesis was observed in the bone marrow. While further work is required to clarify the possible oncogenic roles of both of these HOX11 target genes, these findings have served to identify ALDH1A1 in particular, as a gene which could potentially be involved in HOX11-mediated tumorigenesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/277/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated mass, solute, isotopic and thermal balances of a coastal wetland</field><field name="creator">Rich, John</field><field name="description">Mass, solute (chloride), isotope (deuterium) and thermal balances were completed at Perry Lakes, two semi-permanent 'water table' lakes near Perth, Western Australia.  All balance components except groundwater discharge/recharge were measured independently.  These difficult to measure groundwater components of lake-aquifer interaction were estimated by integrating mass, solute and chloride data in sequential 4 day balances spanning two years.  Before urbanisation, such wetlands functioned predominantly as flow-through lakes.  Now, large winter storm water inputs (and summer artificial level maintenance pumped locally from groundwater) dominate.  In East Lake these inputs together comprise 42% of the annual water budget; groundwater discharge is reduced to just 2%.  Even under flow-through conditions, these 'non natural' inputs are so large East Lake always tends towards a recharge state and commonly becomes a local groundwater mound.  Flow-through is established in both lakes over winter.  Initially each lake functions separately however as winter progresses shared capture and release zones are established.  Maintenance of lake levels in early summer forces East Lake back to recharge status.
 
 Sediment heat flux (Qse) is significant in these very shallow lakes.  Over summer Qse was negative, with a net movement of heat from the water into the sediments which act as a seasonal heat sink.  In winter Qse was positive and stored summer heat was returned to the water column.  This flux at times exceeded 40 W m-2.  Evaporation was determined independently by floating pan, leaving Qse as the thermal balance residual.  Ignoring Qse, annual evaporation determined by thermal balance was over estimated by 7%.  Over and under estimates of individual 12 day balance period evaporation exceeded 50%.  
 
 Monthly Class A (Perth airport) pan coefficients varied from 0.54 (January) to 0.86 (September).  Ten empirical equations for evaporation were calibrated and compared with the East Lake floating pan.  Best performer was the Makkink which tracked the floating pan closely throughout all seasons.  Poorest were the Penman, DeBruin-Keijman, Priestly-Taylor and Brutsaert-Stricker which grossly over estimated late winter evaporation.  Transpiration from Typha orientalis, estimated using hydrograph techniques was 43% of open water evaporation in summer and 28% annually.  Temperature controlled evaporation pans (tracking lake temperature) experimentally determined the local deuterium content of lake evaporate [delta]E, required for isotopic balances.  Techniques employing pans evaporated to dryness and pans evaporated at constant volume were run in tandem continuously for two years.
 
 This study singularly integrates mass, solute and isotope balances thereby allowing groundwater components to be accurately quantified.  The isotope balances are unique, being the only such balances incorporating experimentally derived local deuterium values of lake evaporate.  This study represents the only thermal balance, the only accurate determination of pan-lake coefficients and the first calibration of commonly used empirical evaporation equations for Swan Coastal Plain wetlands.  
 
 Groundwater levels in the western suburbs of Perth have declined over 40 years and a disproportionate larger decline now seriously threatens Perry Lakes.  Modelling suggests regional groundwater extraction exceeds recharge.  Wetland managers can no longer maintain East Lake via local groundwater extraction.  Artificial recharge using imported surface and waste water are possible future management options.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/278/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking Mabo as a clash of constitutional languages</field><field name="creator">Robson, Stephen</field><field name="description">The 1992 decision of the High Court of Australia to uphold the claim of the Meriam people was welcomed as beginning a new era where the unique status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would gain recognition. Intense debate and activity ensued with federal parliament adopting a legislative framework to recognise native title and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation considering its broader constitutional implications. Fourteen years on though much of the promise of Mabo lies unfulfilled.
 
 This thesis draws upon the work of Canadian philosopher James Tully. He writes of contemporary constitutionalism in Western society and its inability to give more than superficial recognition to cultural difference. He locates the problem as lying with the dominant language of modern constitutionalism. This language provides for two main forms of recognition: the equality of self-governing nation states and the equality of individual citizens. Tully locates a way forward through the presence of another constitutional language. Common constitutionalism has enabled an accommodation of cultural differences guided by its three conventions of mutual recognition, continuity, and consent. Moreover, it is beneficial to analysing other studies about the ability of common law to recognise the claims of Indigenous people.
 
 Tully's contribution is applied to an examination of the Mabo events in a way that takes account of Australia's constitutional traditions. The aim is to clarify the languages employed by the representatives of Australia's institutions of governance and whether this places obstacles in the way of recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The inquiry considers the events prior to the High Court's decision, the Keating government's response, and the Howard Government's native title changes. Other chapters examine the constitutional language used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the significance of the Council of Aboriginal Reconciliation.
 
 The central argument of this study is that once it is accepted that the claims of Indigenous people in Australia are constitutional, it becomes possible to appreciate that these were largely voiced through the language of human rights and common constitutionalism. In contrast, when the claims were considered by the High Court and federal parliament significant aspects were articulated through the modern constitutional language. Another thread running through the events was a desire to confront and overcome the influence of the language of White Australia. The thesis concludes by considering the significance of the findings for a settlement between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/281/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organising for sustainable natural resource management: representation, leadership and partnerships at four spatial scales</field><field name="creator">Rockloff, Susan Fay</field><field name="description">Sustainability of natural resources is currently a concern worldwide. The ecological and economic aspects of sustainability have received substantial research attention, but the social aspects of sustainability are less well understood. Participation by affected communities in natural resource management decisions is pivotal to social sustainability. As such, this study examined ten case studies of participation and decision-making by natural resource management groups involved in agriculture in the south-west of Australia. Groups at four spatial scales were studied, including the State, regional, land conservation district (Shire) and subcatchment.
 
 Drawing on these ten case studies, this study analysed participation in these groups from the perspectives of representation, leadership and partnership. Crucial elements of this analysis included identifying the desirable attributes of participation in terms of achieving social sustainability, and then comparing current practice against these ideals.
 
 The study concludes with comments about the efficacy at each spatial scale of current approaches to participation in terms of social sustainability. Central conclusions from this study follow. Some scales are performing better than others in terms of meeting the expectations expressed through the desirable criteria. The State scale is performing well, in terms of its mandate, with its lower expectations than those ascribed to regional and subcatchment scales clearly being met. On the other hand, the expectations associated with the community- and government-led regional groups and subcatchment groups are enormous. 
 
 The only place where there was any major difference between the three was in representation: it was barely considered by respondents from the subcatchment groups, while for the regional groups less of the expectations were met by the community-led than government-led groups. Otherwise they were very similar. The land conservation districts, caught between the regions and subcatchments, seem to be faring the poorest.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/282/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wildlife tourism and the natural sciences: bringing them together</field><field name="creator">Rodger, Kate Jane</field><field name="description">Wildlife tourism, the viewing of wildlife in their natural environment, is a growing sector of tourism world wide. The presence of diverse and unusual wildlife is a major influence on visitors choosing Australia as a destination. Little is currently known about the short and long term impacts on the wildlife on which such tourism depends. This has resulted in management agencies making decisions on the suitability of human-wildlife interactions based on insufficient data. Given the diversity of possible impacts and responses, plus concerns surrounding sustainability, it is essential that good empirical scientific research is available to inform management. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand and hence improve the use of science and monitoring in the management of wildlife tourism.
 
 This study, using surveys, interviews and case study analysis, drew on tour operators, managers and scientists perspectives and understandings of the role of science in the management of wildlife tourism. From tour operators perspectives, accessed through a mail-based survey, insight into features of the wildlife tourism industry in Australia today was provided. It was identified as an industry characterised by diversity in destinations, activities and expectations. Furthermore, the levels of engagement by scientists with tour operators are low, raising concerns about the industry's sustainability, if science is regarded as an essential component of sustainability.
 
 From managers and scientists perspective, accessed through personal interviews, several barriers were identified as hindering scientists from engaging in wildlife tourism science. These included scientists perceptions of power, their normative beliefs of science, and difficulties with transdisciplinary work. Today's culture tends to show a shift away from scientific research. In the past researchers were able to receive funding by appealing to society's faith in science. However, this is not the case today. Through being disengaged and objective scientists have experienced decreased power over funding allocations and in turn decreased funding. Another barrier was the dominant normative view of many biologists and ecologists that wildlife tourism science was not real science because it is subjective. The final barrier was difficulties with the actual research due to the transdisciplinary approach needed.
 
 The case study analysis, of science and wildlife tourism science in the Antarctic region, illustrated how these barriers can be overcome under certain circumstances. Using actor-network theory and the broader sociology of science, this part of the study described the power relationships and potential transformations between scientists, wildlife and managers, which allowed the development of research into human wildlife interactions. By highlighting the use of principles from the natural sciences, wildlife tourism scientists were able to enrol actors into their network. However, this actor network was not permanently 'black boxed' due to scientists' adverse perceptions of the significance and necessity of wildlife tourism science together with their normative beliefs on science, with the network ultimately disbanding.
 
 Key findings from this study included the importance in recognising the epistemological and ontological position that scientists occupy. A broadening of training of natural scientists is required so that they can reflect on their paradigmatic position. Wildlife tourism scientists need to acknowledge and understand different scientific paradigms exist and be able to work across them. Furthermore, wildlife tourism scientists need to emphasise their affinity with the normative beliefs of the biological sciences in their research activities. As the scientific community is subject to values and bias just the same as any other human enterprise, wildlife tourism science would be more readily achieved and accepted by the use of methodologies developed by wildlife biologists to give scientific validity to wildlife tourism science. Only with the employment of the biological principles tied in with the social sciences (i.e. transdisciplinary) will the scientific community have higher regard for wildlife tourism science. Finally, there is a need for scientists to become more politically and socially engaged. Given the importance of science for managing wildlife tourism, mechanisms for increasing the use of science in human-wildlife interaction research are critical for the long-term sustainability of this industry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/283/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A reflective analysis of a transformative pedagogical approach at a rural Thai University</field><field name="creator">Rush, Ed</field><field name="description">Mass culture in Thailand creates idealizations about female beauty which cause many women to engage in destructive behavior such as starvation dieting and forced vomiting. In this dissertation I describe efforts to develop awareness among a group of predominately female students at a rural Thai university about the ideological purposes of these idealizations. Using a CD-based multimedia research template, the students reported the 'common sense' beliefs which help create the beauty ideal and the effects of these beliefs on their own lives and the lives of other women. The major finding of their research was that mass culture creates beauty ideologies to maintain social stratification, in that those women who are made to feel 'ugly' because they do not resemble the white-skinned underweight ideal tend not to be members of the elite social class which has the resources and time to achieve these ideals. The significance of this dissertation lies in the emancipatory effects that it produced; although a Critical Discourse Analysis showed that the students continued to assimilate some of the values and interests which they had identified as 'oppressive', they also demonstrated to varying degrees that they had ceased to think and behave in ways which had caused them mental and physical damage in the past.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/284/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation of flour colour in Western Australia adapted wheat: comparative genomics, molecular markers and QTL analysis</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Karon Magdalene Leanne</field><field name="description">The yellowness of flour colour ranges is an important quality trait in wheat for end-use products and is determined by the accumulation of carotenoids in the endosperm. The aims of this study were to develop EST-based molecular markers for genes encoding enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway leading to xanthophyll accumulation and identify quantitative trait loci for flour colour (b*) and xanthophyll content in Western Australian adapted germplasm.
 
 A novel bioinformatic strategy was developed to identify rice genes encoding key enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and to predict wheat orthologues on the short arm of chromosome 3 or long arm of chromosome 7. The bioinformatic strategy involved the identification of rice carotenoid genes on BAC/PAC contigs aligned to wheat mapped ESTs. Rice genes predicted to have wheat orthologues were selected based on ESTs mapping to regions on wheat homoeologous chromosomes 3 and 7 known to be involved in flour colour. The rice genes predicted to have wheat orthologues were Geranylgeranyltransferase I beta-subunit (GGT-Ibeta) and Rab geranylgeranyltransferase component A (RGGT-A) on the short arm of chromosome 3, Lycopene beta-cylcase (LBC) on the long arm of chromosome 3 and Lycopene epsilon-cylcase (LEC) on the long arm of chromosome 7.
 
 The prediction of these wheat orthologues provided the basis for development of EST-based molecular markers for detecting variation in xanthophyll content. Wheat ESTs with unknown chromosomal locations and having the highest similarity to GGT-Ibeta, RGGT-A and LBC were selected for the development of molecular markers. No EST homologues were identified for LEC and therefore this gene was not further considered. Orthology was confirmed by sequencing and deletion lines were used to confirm chromosomal locations. Two partial orthologues of GGT-Ibeta were identified on the short arms of chromosomes 3B and 3D. A partial orthologue of RGGT-A was mapped to the proximal regions of the short and long arms of chromosome 3B. At least two or more orthologues of LBC were identified from nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. An EST-based molecular marker for GGT-Ibeta was found to be involved in minor variation of xanthophyll content in a Westonia*2/Janz doubled haploid population.
 
 QTL analysis from three doubled haploid populations indicated variation in WA-adapted germplasm may be due to different alleles controlling flour colour. QTLs for b* and xanthophyll content were found to coincide on the short arms of chromosomes 3A, 4D, and 7B and the long arm of chromosomes 7A and 7B in WA-adapted germplasm. Homoeologous expression of regions controlling variation in b* and xanthophyll content on the long arm of chromosomes 7A and 7B suggests the shut-down of genes in the same region on chromosome 7D. The main outcome of this study is flour colour and identification of gene orthologues in wheat controlling variation in xanthophyll content is complex most likely because of the interaction of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway with other pathways.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/285/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can tidal power promote sustainable integrated coastal development in Bangladesh?</field><field name="creator">Salequzzaman, M.D.</field><field name="description">Tidal power is a clean renewable energy. Furthermore, electricity is acknowledged as a key need for development. However, until recently, due to high capital costs and extensive environmental concerns, few tidal power plants are operative around the world. These problems are now being mitigated by the application of appropriate, modern practices and technologies. In particular the use of small scale technologies, innovative financing and the involvement of local communities creates the potential  for tidal power to be a tool in coastal development. This thesis examines the appropriateness of tidal power in the rural coastal community of Bangladesh, where electricity demand is a major development problem. Coastal Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, especially from cyclones, tidal surges and the effects of global warming on sea-level rise. 
 
 Consequently, most of this coastal area has been protected by embankments and sluice gates, which can accommodate the normal tidal head rise and fall. The potential of tidal power to use this infrastructure, together with its associated problems and mitigation measures, have been analysed by comparing existing and potential tidal power technologies around the world, including a proposed Kimberley tidal power project in Western Australia. 
 
 The research has identified that a significant amount of power could be produced from the tidal range of coastal Bangladesh by using the simple low-cost technology of tidal wheels in the tidal embankment sluice gates. The electricity produced could be utilised by various coastal interests, such as agriculture, shrimp aquaculture and other resource producing activities. However, the real benefits of this technology are that it can be applied in a way that simultaneously enables the development of local infrastructure and the improvement in living conditions of the local people by creating income generation and employment opportunities in these coastal communities. The thesis puts forward a community based co-management model as a means of effectively integrating tidal power in coastal area management in Bangladesh.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/286/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From colonial outpost to popular tourism destination: an historical geography of the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region 1829-2005</field><field name="creator">Sanders, Dale</field><field name="description">While much of inland rural and regional Australia in the early 21st Century is struggling to survive through a tough restructuring period and significant population decline with its associated impacts on local services, many coastal locations are experiencing unprecedented development including non-urban population growth and coastal subdivision.  There is an urgent need for a more holistic approach to future development in coastal communities around Australia that recognises the contribution of past land uses and the implementation of sustainable policies and practices that link the environment, people and the economy.  Many of these coastal locations share a similar post contact history of a constant effort to create and maintain sustainable communities.  Most have experienced several different dominant land uses since European occupation as various political and ideological forces have promoted new ideas and technologies to exploit the available natural resources.  Remnants of these past activities, including pre European land use, still remain and have now become an important component of the cultural heritage and tourist product in these coastal regions.  
 
 The Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region occupies the extreme south western corner of Western Australia approximately 250km south of the city of Perth and is one location that shares this experience.  The region is presently one of the fastest growing areas in Western Australia outside of the metropolitan area.  Between 1991 and 2001 the population of the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region increased by 65% to 31, 911 (ABS 2001).  Although the region has been experiencing unprecedented growth since the late 1980s, it had previously comprised mostly small rural communities struggling to maintain their populations and economic viability.  The Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region has been 'discovered' no less than seven times since European occupation in 1830.  It has been 'invaded' by a series of different people from both the public and private sectors who have initiated diverse land uses for different objectives.  Each new land use activity was initiated from outside the region as people reappraised the environment with little consideration of the knowledge of the local environment obtained through past land use activities.  These new land uses were usually politically or demand driven and related to the broader development of the state rather than the long term viability of the local region.  Whilst the phenomenal development associated with tourism constitutes the most recent land use activity, tourism was preceded by Early European agricultural Settlement from the 1830s; the timber Industry from the 1850s; the Group Settlements and establishment of a dairy industry from the 1920s; the alternative lifestylers from the 1960s and the viticultural industry from the 1970s.
 
 This thesis will explore both the historical and contemporary processes which have played a significant part in shaping the region's cultural landscapes and underpin the current development issues it is experiencing.  It is argued that much of the land use history of this region has been framed by a consistent frontier ethos and that it is only relatively recently the concept of sustainable development has begun to be implemented even though ironically its principles were effectively guiding land use practices for centuries before European settlement.  This thesis concludes that for the most recent land use activity of tourism to achieve the long term sustainability that has eluded so many past land uses, development must facilitate multiple land use management and encourage the continued incorporation of past land use activities to maintain the region's cultural, social and economic diversity rather than tourism overpowering them to become the dominant activity.  At the same time, of course, these multiple land uses must themselves be managed by contemporary and evolving principles of sustainable development.  All stakeholders both within and outside the region need to adopt a more holistic sustainable approach to managing the region's resources learning from both past land use attempts and the principles of Indigenous cosmology including the importance of the interconnectedness of people, environment and economy.  If this is achieved then it is more likely that both current and future generations will have a high quality of life with long term economic security that also ensures the long term maintenance of their socio-cultural and environmental resources.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/287/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on new plant phytoplasma and viruses infections and molecular dissection of virus resistance using Medicago truncatula</field><field name="creator">Saqib, Muhammad</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis is in two areas - study of novel pathogens resulting from new encounters between crop and native species and 'mining' for plant virus resistance genes in the model legume Medicago truncatula.
 
 The history of agriculture in Western Australia (WA) is less than 150 years old. All major broadacre and horticultural crops grown in WA have been introduced from overseas. These introduced horticultural and field crops potentially carry pathogens which may be transferred to infect native vegetation. Conversely, cultivated plants are vulnerable to infection by pathogens present in indigenous plants. This potential for new disease encounters is compounded by expansion of agriculture to crop new land and by predicted climate changes. These changes may provide selective advantage to a particular pest or disease, enabling infection to increase and so increase crop losses or damage native species. Global trade in agricultural produce also increases the potential for introduction of exotic pathogens. The focus of the first part of the research was to look for new pathogens of crops and native plants in WA.
 
 A series of field trips to study diseases in horticultural crops and native vegetation were made in the agricultural regions of Carnarvon, Broome, Kununurra, Perth and the surrounding metropolitan area. Although the initial focus was on virus diseases, the work expanded to study phytoplasma-associated diseases, because of their widespread occurrence and clear symptoms.
 
 In the agricultural region around Kununurra the potyvirus Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) was found infecting Phaseolus vulgaris crops. Sequencing of isolates collected provided the first reliable molecular confirmation of the presence of BCMV in Australia. 
 
 In joint work with K. Bayliss three commercial Paulownia tree plantations near Perth were found exhibiting symptoms of Witches'-Broom disease. The Paulownia trees were found to be associated with 'Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense' 16SrXII group. Chickpeas in the Kununurra region were found with symptoms of stunting, little leaf and proliferating branches and tested positive for phytoplasma. Sequencing confirmed the presence of a phytoplasma with high similarity to the 16SrII group 'Ca Phytoplasma aurantifolia' (peanut witches broom group). This is the first molecular evidence for a phytoplasma-associated disease in chickpea. Red clover (Trifolium pratense), several other pasture legumes and paddy melon (Cucumis myriocarpus) with symptoms of diminished leaf size, pallor, rugosity, leaf deformation, shoot proliferation and stunting were observed amongst pasture plots in south-western Australia. All species with these symptoms were positive for a phytoplasma resembling 'Ca Phytoplasma australiense, 16SrXII group. This association was confirmed for red clover and paddy melon by subsequent nested PCR and sequence analysis. This is the first time that 'Ca. Phytoplasma australiense, 16SrXII group, has been reported infecting these hosts in southern WA. Snakebean (Vigna unguiculata var. sesquipedalis) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants with phytoplasma-like symptoms were found in the horticultural region at Broome. The symptoms on snakebean were typical of phytoplasma disease. Sequence analysis identified that the agent associated with the symptoms as a strain of sweet potato little leaf strain V4 (SPLL-V4) phytoplasma (16SrXII group, strain of 'Ca Phytoplasma australiense'). SPLL phytoplasma has not been reported in snakebean or tomato in this isolated agricultural region. In a survey in the Gascoyne region phytoplasma-like symptoms were found in tomato, eggplant and papaya. Previously in this region plants had been found to be associated with peanut witches broom phytoplasma 16SrII group 'Ca Phytoplasma aurantifolia'. Phytoplasma-like symptoms which included bunchy growth, witches' broom and 'little leaf' were observed in Allocasuarina fraseriana (Western Sheoak, Casuarina) and Acacia saligna (Acacia, Orange Wattle) trees in Kings Park and Botanic Garden Perth WA. Phytoplasma-associated disease was confirmed for the first time in native Australian casuarina and acacia trees in WA. Based on the identification of these phytoplasma associated diseases in WA, phytoplasma-associated diseases can be divided into two zones, because phytoplasma 16SrII group was found mostly in the north west of WA and the 16SrXII group in the south west of WA. This work has added to knowledge of the extent and distribution of phytoplasma disease in WA: it is concluded that crop-associated phytoplasma disease originated from native vegetation.
 
 The aim of the second part of the research was to screen and map a virus resistance gene in the model legume M. truncatula to better understand host/pathogen interactions of legume-infecting viruses. Natural resistance genes found in M. truncatula could then be used to locate similar genes in grain legumes (e.g. chickpea and lupins) for practical applications. M. truncatula is a model legume which has a relatively small genome. International consortia have been established to develop genomic resources for M. truncatula. The M. truncatula core collection (from SARDI, South Australia) totalling 230 accessions was screened for resistance/susceptibility to four legume-infecting viruses: Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) and Subterranean clover mottle virus (SCMoV). Five plants from each of the 230 phenotypically distinct members of the M. truncatula core collection were challenged with one isolate of each virus using infectious sap together with five uninoculated control plants for each accession. The symptoms that developed were recorded and virus presence was confirmed by ELISA for inoculated and systemic leaves. Accessions that were potentially resistant were retested to check for escapes. The result from this screen was that 5 accessions were potentially resistant to AMV, 56 to BYMV, 21 to CMV and 42 to SCMoV. The remaining accessions were susceptible to all four viruses with symptoms which ranged from no apparent symptoms (symptomless systemic infection) to highly susceptible and plant death. In continuing work with DAFWA (Dr R. Jones) accessions potentially resistant to AMV, BYMV and CMV are being challenged with additional isolates to check for the presence of genes providing broader resistance.
 
 The Sobemovirus SCMoV was chosen for further study because it is the most widespread viral pathogen of subterranean clover pastures in Australia. It is also a high titre, mechanically transmitted virus which gave the least escapes on infection. SCMoV has a linear, single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 4.25 Kb. Making use of natural resistance is an effective means to reduce pasture losses caused by SCMoV. From the screen of the core collection of M. truncatula, amongst the lines resistant to SCMoV a single dominant hypersensitive resistance was detected in line DZA-315. To accelerate mapping of the SCMoV resistance gene, an F8 RIL population of a cross between the resistant line (DZA-315) and a susceptible line (Jemalong-J6, A-17) was sourced and obtained from INRA Toulouse. A total of 166 RILs were phenotyped for resistance and susceptibility to SCMoV. Resistant and susceptible lines showed parental phenotypic symptoms with 84 being susceptible and 82 being resistant. This indicated the presence of a single resistance (R) gene. This phenotypic data was combined with genotypic data (76 polymorphic molecular markers) already available for this RIL population to provide a framework map. Mapmaker and Mapmanager mapping programs were used to locate the position of the resistance gene. This framework map indicated a position for the resistance gene on the long arm of chromosome 6.
 
 Additional polymorphic SSR markers flanking the R gene locus on chromosome 6 were used to map the position of the R gene more closely. These SSR markers were developed from a parental cross of M. truncatula line A17 and A20 at UC Davis and from a parental cross between line A17 and DZA 315 developed at INRA Toulouse. Ten new polymorphic SSR markers were identified and located on the long arm of chromosome 6 after analysis of the F8 RIL population. When combined with the other phenotypic and genotypic data a more accurate map position for the SCMoV R gene was obtained. The results indicate that the R gene to SCMoV is located on the long arm of M. truncatula chromosome 6 between position 35 to 38 centimorgans (cM). The closest marker to the SCMoV R gene is marker mtic153 which is about 2.3 cM away. From existing maps of M. truncatula most of the R genes located in this region are of the TIR-NBS-LRR type and occur in R gene clusters. A series of BACs that span the region of interest have been identified in which SCMoV R gene should be present.
 
 M. truncatula has been used as a model legume to study a number of symbiotic (e.g. rhizobium) and pathogenic interactions (e.g. fungal and nematode), but this is the only example of its use to study legume-virus interactions. The results obtained indicate the potential of using M. truncatula as a model to study resistance response to other legume viruses and provide a firm basis for identifying the hypersensitive R gene that confers resistance to SCMoV.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/288/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">With a whole heart: nurturing an ethic of caring for nature in the education of Australian planners</field><field name="creator">Sarkissian, Wendy Anne</field><field name="description">This interdisciplinary dissertation addresses one aspect of the education of Australian urban planners: an ethic of caring for Nature, conceived as a deeply grounded, contextual, ethic based on a sense of connection with the natural world. It articulates what an ethica of caring entails, explores the current state of and' potential for the teaching of environmental ethics within Australian planning schools, examines fiom an ethical standpoint the educational implications of direct connection with Nature, and proposes the foundations for a radical curriculum for planning education to nurture an ethic of caring for Nature. Three pivotal assumptions underpin this research: that Australian urban development is contributing to both local and global ecological crises; that the activities of urban planners help to determine the form and style of urban development and, by implication, the ecological impacts; and that the education of urban planners influences their practice. I argue that a complete revisioning of Australian urban planning education is necessary to counter the entrenched anthropocentrism and utilitarianism which underpin both planning practice and education.
 
 The dissertation sets out to address three questions: What is the current situation in Australian planning schools with respect to the relationship between planning education in general and education in environmental ethics, in particular?; How might the education of urban planners in Australia be changed to contribute to the solution of ecological problems?; and How important to the educator and the student who ultimately becomes the practitioner is a direct experience of Name in giving substance and energy to the formution of environmental ethics?
 
 The study employs two primary research approaches or paths, the path of explanation and the path of expression, the first with a quantitative emphasis, and the second being primarily qualitative research; both are within the interpretive research paradigm. It addresses the educational origins of what appears to be: planners' continued unquestioning participation in Australian urban development ad their resistance to embracing more realistic formulations of a relationship with Nature. It offers the first articulation of a learning model upon which an undergraduate or postgraduate curriculum could be based.
 
 The dissertation begins by asking, via an exploration of secondary sources in feminist epistemology and ethics, what an ethic of caring could involve. The current situation with respect to environmental ethics education in Australian schools of planning is then thoroughly examined, yielding the tentative conclusion that virtually nothing is happening, that there is little to build on. Asking what could be the potential for direct experience of Nature to nourish an ethic of caring, the next section chronicles my personal experience of a year spent consciously attempting to do this: a journey to my ecological self. The last sections of the dissertation summarise the lessons learned from all aspects of the investigation, particularly the direct experience of Nature. Following examination of problems inherent in emancipatory and technocratic liberal educational philosophies, I propose the elements of a radical curriculum for planning education to nurture an ethic of caring for Nature. In the learning model which emerges, the T.EN.C.E.L. model, I argue for a curriculum which contains components of the following elements: teamwork; direct experience of Nature; grounding in community processes and experiences; the formal study of ethics, by means of environmental ethics courses; and attention to the aspects of professional literacy necessary to understand environmental issues related to planning practice.
 
 The dissertation also includes, as an appendix, a videotape, Beginning Again with Nature: Environmental Ethics, designed to communicate those qualities of my journey to the ecological self which are better expressed in sound and images.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/289/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age compositions, growth rates, reproductive biology and diets of the black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri in four estuaries and a coastal saline lake in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Sarre, Gavin A.</field><field name="description">The aims of the studies undertaken for this thesis on the black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri, a species which is confined to estuaries, were to determine the following. (1) The age compositions, growth rates, reproductive biology and diets of the populations of this species in four different estuaries (Swan River, Moore River, NomaluplWalpole and Wellstead estuaries) and a landlocked saline lake (Lake Clifton) and (2) the seasonal and regional distributions of this species within one estuary (Swan River Estuary).  Acanthopagrus butcheri were collected at regular intervals from nearshore, shallow (&gt; 2 m) and offshore, deeper (&lt; 2.5 m) waters of the permanently open Swan River Estuary and intermittently open Moore River Estuary on the lower west coast of Australia and from the permanently open Nomalup/Walpole Estuary and normally closed Wellstead Estuary on the southern coast of Western Australia. One hundred A. butcheri were also obtained from a landlocked, coastal saline lake (Lake Clifton), 90 km south of the Swan River Estuary. Sampling employed seine nets, composite gill nets and rod and line.
 
 In the Swan River Estuary, black bream typically occur in the saline reaches of the tributary rivers which constitute the upper estuary. However, during heavy freshwater discharge in winter, many individuals are swept downstream into the basins that constitute the middle estuary. These fish migrate back into the upper estuary in spring and the larger fish spawn in this region between the middle of spring and early summer. Although smaller fish tend to remain in the upper estuary during summer as salinities increase, the larger fish migrate further upstream where salinities are lower. The salinities in which A.butcheri spawned in the different systems ranged from as low as 5.5 - 6.8 %CJin the Moore River Estuary to as high as 40.7 - 45.2 %O in the Wellstead Estuary.
 
 The use of marginal increment analyses demonstrated that the opaque zones revealed in otoliths by sectioning are formed annually and could thus be used for ageing individual fish and that the opaque zones visible in whole otoliths prior to sectioning could be used for ageing fish up to six years old. The number of annuli on scales did not provide a reliable estimate of age. The structure of the age compositions in the four estuaries varied, presumably reflecting differences in fishing pressure and, in one case, the lack of recruitment in some years. The growth rates of A. butcheri in the four estuaries and landlocked lake differed, which is probably related to variations in one or more of the following; water temperature, density of fish, salinity and the type of food available.
 
 The monthly trends exhibited by gonadosomatic indices and the prevalence of different gonadal maturity stages and mature oocytes demonstrate that spawning typically occurs in spring and early summer. The frequent occurrence of yolk vesicle, yolk granule oocytes and post-ovulatory follicles in the ovaries of some mature fish provides strong circumstantial evidence that A. butcheri is a multiple spawner, i.e. spawns more than once during each breeding season. Estimates of the minimum total fecundity ranged between 9.07 x lo4 and 7.09 x lo6, with a mean of 1.58 x lo6. Variations amongst the lengths and ages at first maturity in three of the estuarine populations of A. butcheri could apparently be attributed to the influence of variations in growth rate.
 
 Female and male Acanthopagrus butcheri both possess an ovotestis, a feature characteristic of the Sparidae. There is strong circumstantial evidence that, once a member of this species reaches maturity, it can be considered a rudimentary hermaphrodite, i.e. it possesses either functional ovaries and far smaller and immature testes or functional testes and immature ovaries of variable size. There was no evidence that this species undergoes either a protogynous or protandrous sex change. Acanthopagrus butcheri can consume various benthic and epibenthic prey, including crustaceans, polychaetes, molluscs and teleosts, and can also ingest considerable volumes of algae. However, the dietary compositions of A. butcheri in the four estuaries and Lake Clifton differed markedly, whch, together with information on the biota in those systems, indicate that A. butcheri feeds on those prey items that are most abundant in their environment. Yet, there is also evidence that, in any given system, A. butcheri will focus on a particular prey, even when other prey, which are regularly consumed in considerable volume in other systems, are abundant. The dietary compositions of A. butcheri in each estuary underwent ontogenetic changes, which would reduce the potential for intraspecific competition for food resources.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/290/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Researching sustainability: material semiotics and the Oil Mallee Project</field><field name="creator">Bell, Sarah Jane</field><field name="description">Sustainability responds to crises of ecology and human development and the relationships between them. Sustainability cannot be adequately described using disciplinary categories arising from the modern dichotomy between nature and culture. Sustainability research requires a methodology that reflects the reality of its subject.
 
 This thesis presents material semiotics as a methodology for sustainability research. Material semiotics refers to the work of actor-network theorists and latter developments of alternate spatial metaphors for material relationality. Actor-network theory is a methodology that describes human and non-human actors in the same terms. It follows actor through networks of material relationships that they constitute and are constituted by, depicting heterogeneous objects without recourse to prior categories of nature or culture. The description of material relationships in fluid and regional, as well as network, spaces expands the descriptive power of material semiotics to include Others and to better represent complexity.
 
 The Oil Mallee Project is a case study of sustainability in the Western Australian wheatbelt. Indigenous eucalypts, oil mallees, are planted on land that was cleared for agriculture. The above ground biomass can be processed for eucalyptus oil, electricity and activated carbon, and the rights to carbon stored in the extensive mallee roots, or in unharvested trees, can be sold. The Project responds to a number of sustainability issues, including ozone depletion, land degradation, climate change and rural decline. This thesis follows the actors that comprise the Oil Mallee Project to describe its complexity, multiplicity and sustainability. Qualitative interviews with actors in the Project and the wheatbelt provided the primary data, which is supported by documentary material.
 
 Three contingent phases can be identified in the history of the Oil Mallee Project - eucalyptus oil industry, dryland salinity management, and greenhouse response. The Project has persisted because it is simultaneously a regional, network and fluid object. Mallees grow well in the tough conditions of the wheatbelt. Mallees can be integrated with existing networks of industrial agriculture. The Project has achieved contingent stability in policy documents and the networks of scientific research. The fluidity of the Project has enabled it to change shape and identity in response to threats and opportunities, and as relationships break and form, without complete disruption. Specific humans have been central heroes in different phases of the Project. The mallees themselves are the only actors that have been consistently central to the identity of the Project.
 
 Sustainability requires knowledge of the relationships between humans and non-humans that constitute the multiple crises of ecology and human development. Sustainability is the re-ordering of those relationships in ways that make possible ecological integrity and human fulfilment. Material semiotics is a methodology for knowing sustainability in ways that reveal the possibilities for such re-orderings.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/291/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silencing the everyday experiences of youth?: issues of subjectivity, corporate ideology and popular culture in the English classroom</field><field name="creator">Savage, Glenn</field><field name="description">This study investigates the influence of popular culture texts on the subjectivities of young people and argues that critical pedagogical practices need to be further deployed by English teachers in response to the corporate driven nature of popular texts. Three levels of synthesized information are presented, using data analysis born of a quantitative survey and in-depth interviews with a group of secondary English students in Perth, Australia.
 
 Firstly, I argue that popular culture texts constitute the predominate form of consumed textual material for young people and that these texts are increasingly defined by corporate ideologies and branding. Secondly, I investigate the influence that these popular culture texts have on the subjectivities and everyday social experiences of young people. I argue that the ideologies and discourses in popular texts position young people to assume subjectivities that are increasingly defined by branding and corporate ideology, and that these texts often have a normalizing effect.
 
 Hence, I argue that young people?s social currency is often defined by the extent to which individuals demonstrate an alliance to the ideologies of popular media, and that individuals who deviate from such popular norms often experience subjugation and exclusion within peer and social settings. Constructivist notions of subjectivity and an analytical framework heavily influenced by Foucauldian theory inform this theorization. Thirdly, I finalize my argument by dealing pedagogically with subject English and areas of it that hold relevance in terms of the integration and analysis of 'the popular'; including critical literacy, multiliteracies and critical pedagogy. I argue that a commitment to critically analyzing popular culture texts in the subject is lacking and that students feel many English teachers are 'out of touch' with the everyday realities of young people and their popular culture influences. I argue that such failures risk producing students whose everyday experiences are silenced and who are unaware of the ways they are being positioned to adopt certain corporate driven subjectivities.
 
 Methodologically this study is informed by principles of critical theory, cultural studies, discourse analysis and a commitment to position the often-silenced student voice as a prime analytical tool. Aspects of autoethnography are deployed through punctuating personal narratives that feature within this text in order to illuminate the journey of self-realization and fundamental self reevaluation I have traveled throughout the production of this research work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/292/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food policy councils: an examination of organisational structure, process, and contribution to alternative food movements</field><field name="creator">Schiff, Rebecca</field><field name="description">The contemporary global food system is plagued by a myriad of problems.  In recognition of the problematic nature of the conventional food system, practitioners and researchers have sought, throughout the past century, alternative, sustainable food production, consumption, and exchange systems. Some of the solutions proposed for these problems suggest the establishment of new institutional forms such as that of the food policy council, an organisation which, through the embodiment of a food systems perspective, proposes innovative local and regional level solutions to food systems problems.
 
 Over the past two decades numerous food policy councils (FPCs) have been created in North America and Australia.  Research on FPCs still remains minimal, leaving many gaps in knowledge as to the role of these organisations concerning the ways that they can and do contribute to the sustainable development of food systems and 'alternative food movements'.  Research to date on the organisational structure of FPCs lacks consideration of organisation theory and the relatively substantial body of literature dealing with evaluation of collaborative, interagency organisations, an organisational type closely related to FPCs.  There is a lack of consideration as to definition of the role of FPCs within the broader context of sustainable food systems movements and the procedures and protocol for effectiveness in achieving outcomes and fulfilling these roles.
 
 Considering the significant gaps in knowledge, this research focusses on identifying a clear definition of the mission or roles of FPCs and investigates some of the previously unexplored organisational characteristics of FPCs as a foundation for identifying what may lead to 'best-practice' organisational structure and process in fulfilling these roles.  Since there is limited information and research to date specifically on FPCs, a qualitative and more specifically grounded theory approach was taken to provide an exploratory and reflexive research design framework.  This design incorporated a continuous, interactive layering of data collection, classification, and analysis.  Following a preliminary literature review, the inquiry focussed primarily on the gathering of information directly from FPCs involving several different types and sources of data.
 
 Research findings revealed several aspects of food policy council objectives that can be considered together as defining the organisational role of FPCs.  This provides a basis for determining the most effective administrative structure and operations management for fulfilling this role.  Findings and analysis also indicated certain components of structure and process that can lead to effectiveness in terms of capacity building and fulfilling organisational roles.  A model of FPC structure is developed and presented to summarise these findings, considering those components revealed through the research as contributing most to effective FPC operation.  The development of this model from a broad and diverse representative sample, indicates that such modelling of structure and process may be applicable to transferring the concept of and creating FPCs in new locations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/293/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterization of Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis gene promoters</field><field name="creator">Schoep, Tobias Delavilla</field><field name="description">A family of E. coli - P. ruminis shuttle-plasmids was constructed to allow the isolation and characterization of gene promoters from the rumen bacterium P. ruminis. The promoter rescue plasmid pBK was used to isolate a total of 4 genomic DNA fragments that promoted transcription in P. ruminis strains 0/10. These promoters, and an additional promoter, previously isolated from P. ruminis strain OR38 (Schoep, 1999), were identified by their ability to initiate expression of a promoterless ermAM gene in P. ruminis. Within 4 of the fragments, a total of 5 transcription start sites were identified in P. ruminis using a novel, fluorescent-primer extension analysis protocol. Comparison of promoters isolated in this and previous studies revealed a strong consensus RNA polymerase DNA-binding motif, including the well characterized -35 and -10 elements. Consensus sequences established for these elements were: TTgacA and AtAATAta respectively, where bold upper-case font, regular upper-case, and lower-case fonts represent conservation in 100%, 80%, and 70% of promoters respectively. The -10 and -35 motifs were interspaced by 16 - 18 nt. Among the newly identified promoters, the consensus for the -10 element was extended one nucleotide upstream and downstream of the standard hexamer (boxed). These motifs were similar to those recognized by eubacterial RNA polymerase containing the alpha -70 like factor. Promoters also contained possible UP elements, and were significantly more curved than protein-coding regions. Additional plasmid vectors were constructed, to allow the use of both the quantitative SYBR green real time PCR and beta-glucuronidase assays, to examine 4 promoters in depth. This showed a wide range of promoter strengths within the group. However, no correlation was found between the composition and context of elements within P. ruminis promoters, and promoter strength.

This research looks at how interactive television can be used by consumers and how it may be best applied by marketers in international holiday travel.
 
 Using the UK international traveller market to Western Australia as case in point, this research had three main research goals: 1) to understand how travellers use information sources with a focus on interactive television; 2) how an individual's previous interactive media and travel experiences may pre-dispose them to using interactive television; and 3) to better understand why individuals interact and what impact the interaction has on the promotional effort.  A travel ad and a travel show segment were used to explore these with impulse (brochure request) and telescopic (destination video) interactive opportunities.  The treatments were deployed over a video-on-demand platform in greater London and participants took part in their homes via their televisions and a self administered questionnaire.
 
 This research has furthered the use of the multi-dimensional grid in understanding information sources in relationship to one another and updated the landscape with modern information sources such as television, teletext, the Internet and interactive television.  Findings from this area of investigation suggest that current interactive television offerings cater better to short-haul destinations and although it currently plays a minor role, interactive television has the potential to significantly contribute to travellers' long-haul holiday planning process.
 
 The finding that individuals understand interactive television through their experience with teletext rather than the Internet and are more likely to use interactive television if they are thorough and experienced planners supports the theory of knowledge transference.  However, most importantly, if an individual has a positive experience with interactive television they will interact again in the future.  Contributions were also made to a better understanding of the interactive television user and the use of interactive television applications to the travel and tourism industry in particular.  Exploration of the differences between the Impulse and Telescopic approaches to interactivity highlighted that while interactivity generally enhances the promotional effort each approach has its own strategic applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/296/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genome sequence of bacteriophage OAR29: a basis for integrative plasmid vectors</field><field name="creator">Seet, Shawn Ginn Ming</field><field name="description">The initial aim of this project was to characterise the integrative recombination mechanism of bacteriophage OAR29 , to provide a better understanding for development of the shuttle plasmid pBA as a site-specific Bacteroides integration vector. RT-PCR showed that the previously identified OAR29 recombination genes, integrase (Int) and excisionase (Xis), were transcribed from pBA in E. coli SCS110, B. thetaiotaomicron AR29 and B. uniformis AR20. In silico derived amino acid sequences from both genes showed only very low levels of similarity to other known Int and Xis in GenBank. To improve understanding of the phage recombination system, the OAR29 genome was sequenced. This revealed a 35,558 bp double-stranded DNA genome with GC content of 39.11%. Bioinformatic analysis identified 53 open reading frames (&gt;30 codons) and gene promoters and terminators that allowed the genome arrangement to be compared with other phages. Comparison of deduced gene products with proteins from other phages identified 6 reading frames, allowed tentative identification of 7 others, but left 40 ORFs unidentified. Those with strong homology to known genes were: large terminase subunit (44.66 kDa), dnaC (27.94 kDa), helix-turn-helix (HTH) transcription regulator (14.69 kDa), cI repressor (26.48 kDa), amidase (18.42kDa) and a novel integrase (54.22 kDa). The integrase gene is located 162 base-pairs downstream of the phage attachment (attP) core site, rather than the previously suggested location upstream of the integration site. The OAR29 attP was shown to include a 16-bp att core region, 117 bp upstream of the previously suggested location. Integration of OAR29  was found to occur at the 3'end of an arg-tRNA gene on the AR29 genome (attB). Imperfect direct repeats with a consensus sequence (ANGTTGTGCAA) were found surrounding the attP core. A review of pBA sequence showed that only the 5' end (435 bp) of the newly identified Int gene was cloned in pBA. Despite this, PCR analysis revealed integration of pBA into the AR29 genome. Serial subculturing of pBA transformed AR29 was able to cure AR29 of the OAR29 prophage, providing an improved host for integrative plasmids, and for detailed studies of AR29 physiology and OAR29 life cycles.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/297/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Naming youth: the construction of the youth category</field><field name="creator">Sercombe, Howard</field><field name="description">The youth category, in its modern form, has emerged under particular social and economic conditions, under the influence of particular social institutions, shaped by particular discourses. This thesis is an inquiry into the constitution of youth as a social category through an examination of these factors.
 
 Through a review of the historical and sociological literature, the thesis establishes the conditions for the emergence of the modem concept of youth in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The evidence suggests that the youth category came into being as a result of changes in the industrial family, the industrial reforms which progressively excluded children and young people fkom the workforce, and the establishment of compulsory schooling - especially secondary schooling. Parallel with these developments, a variety of discourses about youth (or adolescence) were generated, establishing the emergent category in scientific terms. G. Stanley Hall's theories of adolescence, developed around the turn of the century, were perhaps the most influential of these, casting adolescence as a universal stage in life characterised by social and psychological turmoil. In sociology, this theoretical frame has been the subject of longstanding debate. The thesis explores this debate, and attempts to establish a sociological view of the youth , category in the light of the historical and sociological evidence. In these explorations, youth is established as a product of historical processes, a product of political economy and of scientific discourse.
 
 The analysis is brought into the present through a study of how youth are represented in a high circulation daily newspaper, The West Australian. Using standard media analysis techniques, the study examines the construction of language around youth, and the kinds of stories in which they appear in the newspaper, and finds a detailed discursive apparatus through which young people are classified as good or bad, passive (victim, child) or active (perpetrator, adult). These constructions vary with the institutional location of the news source, and with such factors as the gender and ethnicity of the subject, while continuing to be underwritten by orthodox discourses of adolescence. For its part, the newspaper overwhelmingly casts youth in a law and order frame, driven by the appetites of audiences and the economies of news production.
 
 The study explores the differences as well as the continuities in the concept of youth employed in the patchwork of discourse that constitutes newspaper text. In these explorations, youth is established in the present as a contested category, the subject of competing discourses. Competing institutions and professions, in their interventions in the newspaper, try to secure a reading of the youth phenomenon which is consistent with their professional and political objectives.
 
 The thesis is about the constitution of youth. Through the analysis of historical and contemporary discourse about youth, the thesis reveals how the subjection of this section of the adult population is achieved and maintained, how they are established as a pliable, coercible and economically dispensable population, and how the instruments of their governance are legitimated.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/298/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and immunogenic analysis of Jembrana disease virus Tat</field><field name="creator">Setiyaningsih, Surachmi</field><field name="description">Jembrana disease is an acute and severe disease of Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) endemic in Indonesia that is caused by a bovine lentivirus designated Jembrana disease virus (JDV). Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to induce a protective immunity against the disease by immunisation with a crude whole virus vaccine prepared from the tissues of infected cattle. This vaccine has been demonstrated to ameliorate the clinical signs of disease resulting from exposure to virus infection but a safer vaccine amenable to commercial production techniques is required. 
 
 JDV, like all lentiviruses, encodes a transcriptional trans-activator Tat protein that is encoded from one or both of two exons of the tat gene. Tat is particularly essential for virus replication and it was hypothesised that the induction of an immune response in cattle against JDV Tat may effect protection against virus infection. Investigations were therefore conducted on JDV Tat to provide basic information on the protein that would enable it to be further investigated as a potential immunogen for incorporation into vaccines for the control of Jembrana disease.
 
 Analysis of tat transcripts obtained from tissues of cattle infected with three strains of JDV suggested that, during the acute clinical disease, Tat produced at this stage of the disease process was translated from the first coding exon only. Nucleotide variation in this exon, which would have translated into amino acid variations in the Tat protein, was evident especially between strains from geographically different regions of Indonesia. There was; however, conservation of the essential functional domains of cysteine-rich, core and basic regions, which suggested immunity to a single Tat protein might protect against infection by heterologous strains. Subsequent studies on Tat reported in the thesis therefore concentrated on the protein encoded by tat exon 1 of a single strain of JDV. The exon 1 of tat was cloned into the pGEX vector and recombinant Tat expressed in Escherichia coli. Methods for the purification of the expressed protein were developed. Immunogenicity of the recombinant protein was initially demonstrated by inoculation of the protein into a sheep which developed a high titred specific antibody response. Antibodies induced by this recombinant protein recognised native Tat proteins produced by three JDV strains in Bali cattle and provided a valuable reagent for the subsequent detection of Tat in vitro and in vivo.
 
 Aspects of the antibody response to Tat were determined in cattle that had been infected naturally or experimentally with JDV, and compared with the levels of antibody to the immunodominant capsid protein. Tat antibodies were detected in 23 % of 128 Bali cattle from Jembrana disease-endemic areas of Indonesia; in all these cattle, evidence of previous virus infection had been demonstrated by detection of antibody to the JDV capsid protein by Western blot analysis. In cattle experimentally infected with JDV, low levels of serum antibody to Tat were detected by Western blot in the first month post-infection but the levels of antibody then decreased; levels of antibody to the JDV capsid protein increased over the 6-month observation period following infection. The detection of Tatantibody soon after the acute clinical disease suggested that this protein is secreted extracellularly during JDV infection in cattle. In contrast to the antibody response to Tat in JDV-infected cattle, an apparently greater antibody response to Tat was induced by injection of recombinant Tat in Bali cattle. The strong antibody response resulting from inoculation of the recombinant Tat and low levels of Tat antibody in animals that had been naturally or experimentally infected with virus suggested there might be a conformational difference in the recombinant and native Tat protein and that the native protein was a poor immunogen, or that the levels of Tat in infected cattle were too low to induce a strong antibody response. As an alternative means of inducing an immune response to JDV Tat, perhaps one associated with a greater cell-mediated rather than an antibody response, a candidate tat DNA vaccine was produced by insertion of tat exon 1 into a DNA vaccine vector. Transfection of this naked DNA plasmid into mammalian cells induced the expression of a functional Tat protein which maintained antigenicity. The results suggested this construct merits further animal studies attempting to induce a protective immune response against Jembrana disease in cattle. A method of assaying the trans-acting function of Tat was also developed which will have application for quality control procedures for large-scale production of tat DNA vaccine.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/299/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of two chitinase and one novel glucanase genes for engineering plant defence against fungal pathogens</field><field name="creator">Severgnini, Susana M.E.</field><field name="description">Hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinases and glucanases are implicated in plant defense responses against fungal pathogens. These enzymes are responsible for the breakdown of chitin and glucan, two major components of the fungal cell walls. Genes encoding these enzymes have been used to genetically engineer plants to enhance their protection against fungal pathogens.
 
 Western Australia has over 4000 endemic plant species and a largely unknown fungal biota. Given that fungi possessing chitinases and glucanases with novel activities have been isolated in other parts of the world, we propose that fungi from Western Australian soils may possess novel biochemical/enzymatic activities.
 
 The aims of this research project were to isolate chitinolytic and glucanolytic fungi from soil and to clone the genes encoding for chitinase and glucanase enzymes. To achieve these aims, fungi with activity against chitin and glucan were isolated, the activity quantified by colorimetric and inhibition assays and gene fragments with homology to known chitinase and glucanase genes were isolated and their sequences determined.
 
 Soil fungi were isolated from five locations in and around the Perth Metropolitan area of Western Australia with the use of a medium containing Rose Bengal that eliminates all actinomycetes and most bacteria and reduces the growth of fast growing mold colonies.
 
 Forty-one isolates were obtained by this method. Twenty four chitinolytic and glucanolytic fungal isolates were identified by growing them on chitin-containing media to select for those species that utilised chitin/glucan as a carbon source. These were assayed for production of exo- and endochitinolytic and glucanolytic enzymes.
 
 Enzyme activity was compared between crude and dialysed supernatants. Exochitinase activity was determined in the supernatants of 4-day old fungal cultures by the release of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D glucosaminide. The supernatants were measured for endochitinase activity determined by the reduction of turbidity of suspensions of colloidal chitin. Glucanase activity was determined by release of reducing sugar (glucose) from laminarin. Supernatants from eleven of the twenty four isolates showed significant levels of enzyme activity.
 
 Eleven isolates were assayed for activity against purified cell walls of phytopathogenic fungi. Activity was determined by measuring reducing sugars in the fungal supernatants against cell wall preparations of six economically important plant pathogens.
 
 Chitinolytic activity was detected in seven isolates against cell wall preparations of Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani, in four isolates against Fusarium solani and Sclerotinia sclerotium; in five isolates against Ascochyta faba and in six isolates against Leptosphaeria maculans. Similarly glucanolytic activity was detected in eight isolates against B. cinerea, in seven against R. solani, in two against F. solani, in three against S. sclerotium and A. faba and in one against L. maculans.
 
 The supernatants derived from the isolates were used in a bioassay to determine growth inhibition against live B. cinerea spores by measuring turbidity reduction. Growth inhibition was measured against a control (B. cinerea, grown in medium with no added supernatant). Boiled supernatant did not inhibit the growth of B. cinerea spores but there was 100% inhibition by the crude supernatant from ten of the twenty four isolates. Similarly, supernatants were used to assess growth inhibition against live mycelia cultures of F. solani and S. sclerotium. Growth inhibition of F solani ranged from 9- 59%, boiled and crude supernatants respectively whilst growth inhibition of S. sclerotium ranged from 46-75%, boiled and crude supernatants respectively.
 
 Two partial chitinase genes from the soil filamentous  ungus Trichoderma asperellum,(ChiA and ChiB) and a novel glucanase gene from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus (Glu1) were cloned. ChiA, was 639 bp long, encoding 191 amino acids with identity to other chitinase genes. Two highly conserved regions, characteristic of glycosyl hydrolases from family 18, were present.
 
 ChiB, was 887 bp long and encoded a 293 amino acid sequence that was closely related to an endochitinase gene from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma asperellum. The two highly conserved regions corresponding to the substrate binding and active sites that characterise the glycosyl hydrolases from family 18, also found in ChiA, were found in this gene.
 
 Glu1 was 2844 bp long and encoded a 948 amino acid sequence that shared high identity with a beta-1, 3-glucanase from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The sequence contained conserved regions found in glycosyl hydrolases from family 17 that encode for substrate binding, N-terminal sequences and putative asparagine linked glycosylation sites.
 
 The partial putative sequence ChiA is probably a pseudogene because it has two inframe stop codons. However, once the entire sequence of ChiB is known, both ChiB and the novel glucanase gene Glu1 could be useful contenders for engineering resistance in crop plants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/300/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The population genetic structure of Portunus pelagicus in Australian waters</field><field name="creator">Sezmis, Ertug</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the results of an investigation into the population genetic structure of the blue swimmer crab, Portunus pelagicus, in Australian waters. P. pelagicus is an Indo-West Pacific species, with adults and juveniles that inhabit sheltered benthic coastal environments and a planktonic phase (of modest duration) in its life cycle.
 
 The investigation was done by examining the patterns of variation at six microsatellite loci and in a 342 bp portion of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene in the mitochondrial DNA in samples of Portunus pelagicus from a total of 16 different assemblages/waterbodies. Overall, the samples were collected from throughout the geographical range of this species in Australian waters, i.e. from the western seaboard, from the eastern seaboard, from Darwin on the north coast and from South Australia on the south coast. The samples sizes ranged from 4 to 57 individuals, depending on the sample and the genetic assay. The population genetic structure of P. pelagicus was analysed from both a traditional population structure perspective and from a phylogeographical and historical demography perspective.
 
 The traditional assessment of the population genetic structure of Portunus pelagicus indicates that this species exhibits a significant amount of genetic heterogeneity in Australian waters (e.g. FST for microsatellite data = 0.098; [Theta]ST for COI data = 0.375 and [Phi]ST for COI data = 0.492). This assessment also indicates that P. pelagicus exhibits varying degrees of genetic heterogeneity within and between geographical regions in Australian waters, as follows. (1) The genetic compositions of the samples from the different coastlines (i.e. north, south, east and west) invariably showed statistically significant differences for at least two microsatellite loci, although the differences between the samples from the eastern seaboard, Darwin and those from the western seaboard to the north of Port Denison were not as great as those within the western seaboard samples or within South Australian samples. (2) The genetic compositions of the samples from the assemblages on the eastern seaboard of Australia, which ranged from Mackay (21 degrees 06'S) to Port Stephens (32 degrees 40'S), were essentially homogeneous. (3) The samples from the assemblages on the western seaboard of Australia, which ranged from Broome (17 degrees 58'S) to Geographe Bay (33 degrees 35'S), exhibited significant levels of genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, those from south of Port Denison formed a highly distinctive (but not invariant) group compared to those from elsewhere. (4) The samples from South Australia were also highly genetically distinctive compared to those from elsewhere, although they also showed significant heterogeneity amongst themselves. The above findings were more or less suggested by both the microsatellite and COI markers, although the former generally provided a higher resolution picture of the population structure of P. pelagicus than did the latter.
 
 The main findings of the investigation into the phylogeography and recent demographic history of Portunus pelagicus in Australian waters were as follows. (1) A phylogeny constructed from COI sequence variation was shallow, with the lineages showing varied geographical distributions. (2) The results of a nested clade analysis of this variation indicate that range expansion has been a predominant influence on the historical demography of P. pelagicus in Australian waters. (3) The samples from the assemblages on the western seaboard to the south of Port Denison contained low levels of genetic diversity, a sub-set of the diversity present in the samples from lower latitude sites on the western seaboard, and microsatellite-based evidence of having coming from assemblages that have undergone a bottleneck (or founder effect) followed by an expansion in size. (4) The samples from the assemblages in South Australia contained low levels of genetic diversity, phylogenetic affinities with samples from the eastern seaboard, and microsatellite-based evidence of having coming from assemblages that have undergone a bottleneck (or founder effect) followed by an expansion in size.
 
 The two major interpretations to stem from the results of this investigation are as follows. (1) Overall, Portunus pelagicus has undergone a recent (in an evolutionary sense) range expansion, from a single source, within Australian waters. At a finer-scale, this species appears to have colonised south-western Australia from a lower latitude site(s) on the western seaboard and probably colonised South Australia from the southern margins of its range on the eastern seaboard. Regardless, there has been limited penetrance of genetic variation into temperate waters on the western seaboard and into South Australia, presumably due one or more of the barriers to gene flow listed below. (2) P. pelagicus experiences significant restrictions to gene flow within its present-day geographical range in Australian waters due to (i) geographic distance per se; (ii) discontinuities in the distribution of the sheltered coastal environments; (iii) hydrological barriers to dispersal and (iv) possibly low temperatures in the temperature margins of the range.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/301/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motivation of high-achieving athletes and musicians: a person-context perspective</field><field name="creator">Beltman, Susan</field><field name="description">This research explores how motivation is shaped at the interface of person and context, with a focus on motivation in sport and music.  From a social cognitive perspective, motivation research traditionally focuses on factors within the individual, whereas a more situated conceptualisation requires that motivation be studied within a person in context perspective.  This study combines elements of both perspectives.  It is proposed that motivation is shaped at the interface of person and context, where individuals make appraisals of social (other people) and structural (physical or organisational) aspects of their environments.  A holistic view of motivation is adopted that incorporates initial engagement, ongoing involvement and persistence.  
 
 One challenge in current motivation research is to develop appropriate methods to capture such a dynamic, complex construct.  In this study, semi-structured interviews and innovative tasks are used to gather biographical and longitudinal data about high-achieving athletes and musicians from diverse settings.  
 
 The findings reveal that complex personal and contextual factors operate reciprocally and dynamically as individuals make ongoing appraisals of their current situations.  For example, personal factors such as aptitude, and contextual factors such as the existence of community programs, operate in a reciprocal way to shape participants' initial engagement in sport or music.  Complexity is highlighted when examining the role of a unique group of others in sport and music - onlookers (spectators or audience).  A powerful effect on continuing involvement occurs when communities overlap and family members take on roles associated with onlookers.  Participants face a range of potential problems in their lives and there are variations in the way these are perceived, in strategies and resources used, and in their impact on persistence.  An important finding is the dynamic nature of motivation as the nature and extent of participants' involvement in sport or music changes over time.
 
 In addition to deepening our understanding of how motivation is shaped at the interface of person and context, the study offers a unique methodological contribution and the findings have implications for enhancing motivation in applied settings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/302/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of the Temkin-Poet model for electron-hydrogen iso-electronic series scattering</field><field name="creator">Shackleton, Anthony Edward</field><field name="description">An important model in the study of electron-atom collisions was development by Temkin and Poet.

It aims to understand the place of higher education in regional Western Australia historically with a view to critiquing current policy directions and the potential consequences of Crossroads. The thesis argues that the ideologies of marketisation and corporatisation are driving current higher education policy and this may significantly damage the long-term viability of regional campuses and learning centres as well as public and private funding allocations. The implications for the dismantling of the social contract (or social democratic settlement) in the knowledge economy is an important issue for regional populations for their continued growth, health, education and welfare. 
 
 The issues examined here are relevant to regional higher education in this State. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the potential policy effects with regard to accessibility of higher education in regional Western Australia. The thesis analyses the advantages and disadvantages of studying in regional WA in the current policy environment where there has been a dramatic shift in ideology from the welfare state to economic rationalism. Factors that impact on higher education in regional Western Australia include the provision of telecommunications services for access to and participation in the knowledge economy.
 
 The thesis considers the evolution of higher education in Australia in general and more particularly in Western Australia, as it has evolved since its foundations in the mid-nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first century. In this time there have been radical changes in higher education in Australia in line with changes to our society and its place in an increasingly globalised environment. 
 
 The thesis concludes by considering some possible options for the future such as the development of learning communities and branch campuses. In discussing such possible alternative forms of delivery of higher education to regional Western Australia, this thesis seeks to raise awareness in relevant government bodies and in rural and remote communities of their particular higher education needs. It is hoped also to encourage regional communities to become more confident and pro-active in their own endeavours to gain greater access and equity in higher education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/304/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meeting your depth</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Gerrard George</field><field name="description">As a member of the Stolen Generations, my objective and design in this dissertation is part of a larger project, involving the reclamation of my Aboriginal identity, taken from me as a child.

A holistic approach has been adopted that encompasses observations over a range of spatial scales, from whole radula mineralisation processes to those occurring within individual tooth cusps at various stages of development. In addition, mineralisation in radulae from freshly collected animals has been compared to that of animals maintained for extensive periods within a newly developed iron limited system, which restricts radula mineralisation without impeding the formation of the organic matrix.
 
 An evaluation of the iron limitation technique has revealed that maintaining specimens of A. hirtosa within an iron poor environment results in a significant departure from the normal pattern of mineralisation in these animals. As a consequence of iron limitation, there is an obvious increase in the number of unmineralised tooth rows in addition to associated alterations in structure and composition at all stages of tooth development.
 
 In normal specimens of A. hirtosa, the onset of mineralisation in the tooth cusps occurs following the prior accumulation of iron at the junction zone and the sudden accumulation of iron containing granules in the cusp epithelium at tooth row 13. The superior epithelium surrounding the tooth cusps undergoes a series of developmental changes leading up to, and following, the onset of mineralisation. In particular, the abundance of mitochondria within the apical cusp epithelium increases, presumably in order to provide the ideal conditions of pH, and thus solubility, needed for the supersaturation of iron and its nucleation at row 13. Once mineralisation has commenced, the microvilli attached to the cusps develop rapidly, and are suggested to do so in order to facilitate the transport of iron, and thereby ensure that a high concentration gradient of this element into the cusps is maintained.
 
 The delivery of iron into the cusps occurs from two fronts, the first from the superior epithelium via the posterior surface, and the second from the junction zone via an internal pathway situated along the lepidocrocite boundary between the magnetite and core regions of the tooth. The existence of a plume of elements between this internal mineralisation pathway and the junction zone, provides the first direct evidence that the junction zone is involved in the storage and release of elements for cusp mineralisation. Data from iron limited radulae also indicate that iron continues to be deposited at the junction zone in preference to the superior epithelium or cusps, despite the disruption of mineralisation, highlighting the importance of this region in the mineralisation process.
 
 Iron reinstatement experiments have also shown that the internal pathways of iron delivery within the organic matrix remain viable, despite prolonged periods of iron limitation. In addition, the reinstatement of iron has revealed that the plumes, situated between the junction zone and internal mineralising pathway of the cusp, stem from the centre of the plate like junction zone, directly above the stylus canal, a tube like cavity situated within the styli of each major lateral tooth.
 
 An in depth study of the stylus canal has revealed that cells within the canal are remarkably similar to those of the epithelium surrounding the cusps, suggesting that this structure may also be involved in the delivery of ions to the junction zone. The stylus canal is shown to be present in the major lateral tooth cusps of 38 chiton species distributed worldwide, and is therefore likely to be a feature common to all chitons. The presence of the canal, and indeed its absence from the bases of all remaining non iron mineralised teeth, irrespective of chiton species, also points strongly to a functional relationship between the stylus canal and tooth cusp mineralisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/306/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Goal setting for sustainability: a new method of environmental education</field><field name="creator">Sheehy, Lucy Ann</field><field name="description">If current environmental problems are to be addressed and future environmental problems are to be prevented, significant changes are needed in the way people live. Environmental education has been identified as an important tool for encouraging people to make the changes needed for sustainability. However, environmental education has been largely ineffective in doing this. Education about the environment is being achieved, but education that creates the skills and motivation for action is not. 
 
 The purpose of this research was to investigate the potential of goal setting to be used in environmental education programs to develop the skills and motivation required to change environmental behaviour and create positive environmental outcomes. Goal setting is one of the most replicable and reliable of psychology theories, with extensive evidence of its benefits for increasing performance and changing behaviour. The premise of this research was to take an already proven and well-established behaviour change theory and apply it within environmental education programs.
 
 The first step was to develop a framework, which enabled goal setting to be incorporated into a program. To do this the environmental behaviour change literature was reviewed and the components of successful environmental education were identified and incorporated into the framework. The goal setting literature was also reviewed to determine the characteristics of an effective goal and how goal setting could be facilitated to create greater goal achievement. As there has been little research on the community's attitudes towards goal setting a questionnaire was developed to determine if the Perth community uses goals, the characteristics of those goals and how those goals may be linked to behaviour. The survey indicated that most people were already using goals in their daily lives and the majority of people would respond positively to the use of goal setting in an environmental education program. Thus, a new environmental education framework was developed which included providing action knowledge, teaching goal setting skills, setting goals and providing continued feedback and support. The proposed environmental education framework was then implemented and evaluated through two environmental education programs, Green Houses and Living Smart.
 
 The Green Houses program assessed the effectiveness of the framework for reducing household energy consumption and the effectiveness of different communication methods for delivering the framework. Personal communication through the workshop was the most effective method for changing behaviour, with workshop participants reducing their energy consumption by 17%. The website and booklet approach also had reductions in energy consumption (7% and 8%, respectively). The schools group was the only group not to achieve a reduction, suggesting that what the students learnt about energy saving was not being transferred to the home environment or impacting on their parent's behaviour. The groups that set goals reduced their energy consumption by an additional 5% compared to the corresponding control groups and maintained those savings for a significantly longer period of time.
 
 The Living Smart program then assessed the effectiveness of the framework for creating behaviour change across a range of sustainability topics. As a result of the program, participants significantly increased both their environmental knowledge and sustainable behaviours. A control group that received the same environmental information as the Living Smart group, but no goal setting skills, only increased their environmental knowledge. This demonstrated that environmental information alone is not sufficient for changing behaviour. The qualitative evaluation identified that goal setting facilitated behaviour change in participants because it gave them direction and strategy and increased their motivation and commitment to changing their behaviour. Importantly, the goal setting process worked equally well across all the sustainability topics, suggesting that the tool works for a variety of behaviours, not just energy conservation.
 
 In conclusion, the goal setting process and framework created effective behaviour change that was maintained longer than when goal setting is not used. The goal setting process and framework can be delivered effectively through a range of communication strategies and can be applied effectively to a range of environmental behaviours. Therefore, goal setting is an effective and valuable behaviour change tool that has great potential across a range of environmental education programs to create positive environmental outcomes in, for and about the environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/307/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pentecostalism and sustainability: conflict or convergence?</field><field name="creator">Sheppard, Kylie Louise</field><field name="description">Sustainability has become a prominent global project through which peoples and nations are seeking to alleviate poverty and stop environmental degradation. This thesis explores the contribution that Pentecostalism, a global religious movement of some 500 million people, can make to this project at the several levels of practice, political economy and philosophy.
 
 After an initial chapter where the challenges and dimensions of the sustainability project are outlined, the development and characteristics of Pentecostalism as a dynamic global movement are reviewed. This sets the context for a central empirical case study of Citipointe Christian Outreach Centre (a Pentecostal megachurch in Brisbane, Australia). Survey data, content analysis of sermons, and in depth interviews show how one particular congregation is engaging with the social, economic and environmental issues of sustainability. I conclude that although Citipointe's engagement with sustainability issues at a practical level is weak, their demonstrated commitment to community building and the congregation's shared worldview indicate potential for a more constructive engagement. In light of global Pentecostal praxis I suggest that Pentecostalism holds greater potential to engage with sustainability than is being realised at Citipointe.
 
 This thesis contributes to our understanding of how and why Pentecostals are already engaging in social, economic and environmental issues. More broadly, it develops our understanding of the role Pentecostal Christianity can play in sustainability. This thesis proposes that while Pentecostalism can contribute to sustainability at the level of practice, it can make a deeper contribution by addressing the worldview challenge of sustainability. Pentecostal Christianity does this because it can keep the sustainability discourse open to a wider discussion about God, truth and the purpose of life, rather than limit it to matters of science, technology and public policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/308/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of diet on the expression of swine dysentery in experimentally infected pigs</field><field name="creator">Siba, Peter</field><field name="description">Swine dysentery (SD) is a severe mucohaemorrhagic colitis resulting from infection with the anaerobic spirochaetal bacterium, Serpulina hyodysenteriae. The disease affects weaner and grower pigs throughout the world, and causes significant financial losses due to mortality, decreased rate of growth, poor feed conversion, and expense of chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that despite the presence of S. hyodysenteriae in pigs on many farms, clinical signs of SD do not always occur. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of diet on the clinical expression of SD. The ultimate aim was to identify diets that could be used to prevent or control the disease.
 
 One hundred and seventy-eight weaner pigs were purchased from specific-pathogen free farms and fed one of 16 diets based on: cooked riceanimal protein, cooked rice-dehulled lupin, wheat-lupin, wheat-animal protein, parboiled rice dehulled lupin, parboiled rice-animal protein, and processed (hammer-milled or steam-flaked) cereal grains (barley, groats, maize, sorghum and wheat) supplemented with animal protein. Eighty four pigs on these diets were slaughtered after one month to measure the influence of the diets on parameters in the large intestine, including organ sizes, and pH, VFA concentrations and dry matter content of the digesta in the caecum, and proximal and distal colon. The cooked rice-animal protein diet caused low levels of microbial fermentation in the large intestine of pigs as indicated by higher pH values, lower VFAs, smaller intestinal organ sizes, and drier contents in the colon and rectum, compared to pigs on the other diets. A limited amount of fermentative substrates from the cooked rice-animal protein diet entered the large intestine, and this led to a low microbial fermentation activity. Pigs fed diets containing cereal grains, parboiled rice and or dehulled lupins had greater fermentative activity in the large intestine. Parboiled rice unexpectedly was not easily digestible. Of the processed cereal grain diets, steam-flaked grains resulted in significantly higher (&lt;0.05) intestinal pH values than hammer-milled grains. This suggested that steam-flaking process made the nutrients (most likely starch) more available for digestion in the small intestine than did the hammer-milling process.
 
 Another 94 pigs fed on the various diets were orally challenged with broth cultures of S, hyodysenteriae and were monitored for faecal excretion of spirochaetes, and for the development of SD. Diseased pigs were slaughtered immediately, and healthy pigs were slaughtered after 4-6 weeks, and changes in the large intestine were recorded. None of 16 challenged pigs fed cooked rice-animal protein developed SD and it was assumed that the reduced fermentation with this diet inhibited colonisation by S. hyodysenteriae, and expression of SD. Disease occurred in varying numbers of pigs fed all the other diets, for example cooked rice-dehulled lupin (83.3%), wheat-dehulled lupin (62.5%) and wheat-animal protein (60%). The diseased pigs developed diarrhoea with blood and mucus, were depressed, lacked appetite and showed gross and microscopic evidence of severe mucohaemorrhagic colitis. When two pigs fed the protective cooked rice-animal protein diet were transferred to the wheat-dehulled lupin diet, one died of acute clostridial enterotoxaemia, whilst the other developed SD. This provided further evidence for the protective effect of the cooked rice-animal protein diet.
 
 Of the processed cereal grain types, steam-flaked maize and steam-flaked sorghum diets containing animal protein protected all pigs against SD, although small numbers of animals were used. All cereal-based diets resulted in greater fermentation than the cooked rice-animal protein diets, but fermentation was relatively reduced with steam flaked maize.
 
 The protective rice-animal protein diet was fed to pigs on a commercial piggery with SD. It resulted in good growth rate and carcass composition, but unfortunately no disease occurred amongst the control pigs during the experiment, so its efficacy against SD in the field could not be assessed.
 
 In conclusion, all protective diets were based on cooked cereal grains which had low levels of non-starch polysaccharides and resistant starch (cooked rice, steam-flaked maize and steam-flaked sorghum) and animal protein. It appears that reducing the availability of such fermentable substrate in the large intestine prevents colonisation by S. hyodysenteriae, and protects pigs from developing SD. This is a major new paradigm for the control of this important disease.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/309/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking innovation and local uptake in rural development: potential for renewable energy cooperatives in Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Siddiqui, Firoze Ahmed</field><field name="description">In Bangladesh, as elsewhere in the world, energy both commercial and noncommercial, serves as a major vehicle for development. In the last three decades, lopsided development efforts, without proper concern for the environment and productivity level of natural resources have created significant problems for development sustainability in Bangladesh. The energy sector faces deep crisis in meeting increasing energy demands for development of agriculture, industry, transportation and other sectors of economy.
 
 The country is heavily dependent on import of commercial fossil fuel energy, petroleum, petroleum products and coal. Such dependency makes Bangladesh economy more vulnerable to external price shocks in the international energy market. Non-commercial energy plays a dominant role in overall energy consumption in Bangladesh. Use of non commercial energy constitutes about two-thirds of the country's total energy balance and is almost entirely supplied from the already overstressed biomass resources of the country. The population size and the vast majority living in rural areas have created immense pressure on the country's biomass resources resulting in massive deforestation, decline of soil fertility and reduced productivity of agriculture. Desperate access to resources, particularly in rural areas is also causing uneven development of the rural population in Bangladesh.
 
 The development of the energy sector is a time bound issue and demands proper and timely attention. For Bangladesh, substitution of current biomass energy use with iv sustainable energy sources and their effective management is therefore critically important to sustain its overall development.
 
 There is ample scope for introducing energy efficient technologies and energy conservation measures in commercial and non-commercial energy use in Bangladesh. Effective and realistic energy planning and policy formulation is therefore crucially important for sustainable development in Bangladesh.
 
 The thesis explores the possibility of introducing an alternate approach to rural energy development through a series of case studies on selected technologies viz. biogas and improved efficiency cook stoves technology projects in the public sector and Grameen Shakti's renewable energy programme in the private sector.

At high salinities, the salt-tolerant macrophyte-dominated ecological regime may be replaced by a regime dominated by benthic microbial communities, further reducing the structural and functional diversity of salinised wetland ecosystems. There is little prospect of restoring salinised systems to a freshwater state, meaning that saline macrophyte dominated wetlands have a heightened structural and functional importance in this landscape. Prior to this study, little was known about the drivers for change from one ecological regime to another in salinising wetlands or about rates of ecosystem response to these drivers. 
 
 This study used experimental and observational data from seven saline wetlands in order to identify some of the potential mechanisms for the transition between the salt tolerant submerged macrophyte-dominated regime and the benthic microbial community-dominated regime. The applicability of existing conceptual models for ecological regime shifts was then tested against these data. Some of the mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of the macrophyte-dominated regime were explored by examining the effects of salinity on germination and flowering in a series of salt-tolerant submerged macrophytes. The initiation and dominance of benthic microbial communities over a range of salinity and wetting regimes was also examined.
 
 The results suggested that macrophyte communities are unlikely to develop in seasonally-drying wetlands at high salinities (&gt;45 ppt), but will usually germinate and establish well at lower salinities. It was also predicted that although benthic microbial communities can survive and grow across a wide range of salinities, they are likely to be outcompeted at low salinities by macrophytes or by phytoplankton blooms if water column nutrient levels are high. However, water permanence may facilitate benthic microbial community dominance.
 
 Existing conceptual models of ecological regime transitions, such as the alternative regimes model, did not account for the effect of water regime on the dynamics of seasonally-drying systems. Therefore, a new conceptual model incorporating the interaction between hydrology and salinity in seasonally-drying wetlands was proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/311/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagined geographies: women's negotiation of space in contemporary Australian cinema, 1988-98</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Catherine</field><field name="description">Imagined Geographies: Women's Negotiation of Space in Contemporary Australian Cinema is an exploration of the nexus between gender and locale in films from the last decade, 1988-98. This thesis examines the way meaning is made through the negotiation of diverse geographies by central female protagonists in a selection of recent Australian feature films. The films I analyse were predominantly produced by female writers and/or directors.
 
 In the context of Australian Cinema, locale is an area much talked about but little theorised. It is an issue which remains in the background of much scholarship and is often tangential to many arguments but rarely constructed as a central concern. Where it is foregrounded, as in Ross Gibson's work, it is reduced to the significance of landscape or 'natural locations' rather than examining the diversity of its manifestations.
 
 Two notable but related spatial shifts have occurred in Australian cinema of the 1990s. The first is a change in industrial practice. Female artists are now creating spaces for themselves in mainstream feature filmmaking - spaces traditionally occupied by men. This trend is away from constructions of a distinctly feminist cinema or counter-cinema which was identifiable in the 1970s. Second, there is a shift in the character of on-screen space. The presence of growing numbers of women writers, directors and producers in the Australian film industry is shifting the cinema's focus away from traditional 'masculine' topographies - the pub, the prison and the outback - thus allowing explorations of other spaces and visions to develop. I am arguing therefore that there is a feminization ofspace occurring in Australian cinema.
 
 In this thesis I investigate representations of so-called traditional 'feminine' or domestic domains. The place of the gendered body and embodiment in films is a central concern and is theorised in the first chapter. As we move through the thesis chapters, sexed bodies enacting gender in a variety of ways and in different zones - the car, the house, the suburb and the country town - will be explored. Through these analyses I examine the methods some film directors employ to problematize space in such a way that their work overcomes the limitations of its previously dominant representations. This thesis is primarily an attempt to open up the field of criticism to acknowledge the diversity of locales which exist within the rich tapestry of Australian Cinema.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/312/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving off the beaten track: developing a critical literacy in backpacker discourse</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Rebecca Jane</field><field name="description">Reaching beneath the market surface of backpacker culture, this doctoral research probes uncomfortable politics, excluded voices and global inequalities. It questions why, in a context of economic inequality, environmental crisis, terrorism and war, the tourism industry continues to grow, unhampered by politically fractured and uneasy mediations of the world. Arguing that tourist modalities are defined in a popular memory matrix where the rules and norms for becoming a tourist are negotiated through conversation, television, popular literature, travel guides and the Internet, this research project critiques both popular and academic tourist pedagogy.
 
 In forging an interdisciplinary dialogue between Cultural Studies and Tourism Studies, this doctoral research seeks new ways of theorising depost-globalisation. Market-driven renditions of the tourable world displace, marginalise and exclude oppositional, negative, violent and discriminatory narratives. Placing a spotlight on the discomforts found in backpacker discourse requires the application of progressive meta-theoretical discourses, alongside postcolonial and poststructuralist analysis. A serious study of touristic popular culture implicates tourism in terrorism, backpacking in poverty, imperialism in globalisation, mobility in power and backpacker discourse in the re-writing of a contemporary subaltern. 
 
 The original contribution to knowledge emerging from this doctorate is via the application of Bauman and Said's late work to independent tourist discourses. The innovation is formed through disciplinary connections and popular cultural applications. There is also a re-theorisation of Spivak's most famous study, applying metaphors of the pyre to sites of backpacker tourism, with the aim of developing listening literacies. My research justifies the introduction of two new theoretical trajectories for the Tourism Studies academy. The first new approach encourages and frames a listening literacy amongst tourist cultures so they can acknowledge silenced and displaced agents in host guest interaction. The second new approach aims to infuse touristic popular culture with a powerful and political pedagogy that teaches mobile citizens to read difference and diversity.
 
 A pleasure filter obscures the costs and consequences of global markets, often at the expense of local communities and individuals. This thesis focuses on the inequalities disseminated in and through backpacker tourism. It posits that it is not only important to change the way the tourist industry operates but also that it is necessary to change the way tourists tour. Moving off the beaten track in approaches to the study of tourism, this research project forges a new path for Tourism Studies that merges cultural theory and everyday life to develop a critical academic literacy for backpacker discourse.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/313/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of Phytophthora species by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Siricord, Cornelia Charito</field><field name="description">Phytophthora diseases have caused worldwide economic, social and environmental impacts for decades. Once their presence is confirmed, they are difficult to eradicate. To reduce and manage the damage inflicted by the pathogen, fast and reliable disease management protocols are required. Tests that enable the rapid and reliable identification of the pathogen assist greatly in disease management.
 
 Phytophthora species are traditionally not only detected by baiting but also by plating of symptomatic tissue on selective media. Species can be identified by the characteristics of the mycelium growing out of the bait. However, the method is low throughput, labour intensive, and prone to false negatives. An alternative approach would be to detect the pathogen by the presence of its DNA. This involves amplification of the pathogen DNA using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and detection of the amplification product. Detection is usually by agarose gel electrophoresis. However, this is also a labour intensive process involving pouring, loading, running, and staining of the gels. The aim of this thesis is to explore the use of Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionisation Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for detection of PCR products. This procedure enables the analysis of large numbers of samples within a very short time-frame as the average time for analysis of each sample is in the order of milliseconds.
 
 The assay involves annealing an extension (genotyping) primer to the PCR product and its extension by a single nucleotide. The nature of the nucleotide added differentiates species as does the site to which the primer anneals. Multiple extension (genotyping) primers can be used together in a single reaction for detection of multiple species. In this project four genotyping primers (GPs) were designed from the ITS regions of Phytophthora palmivora, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Phytophthora citricola, and Phytophthora cambivora.
 
 The extension primers were tested for their specificity on the DNA of the target species. The four primers designed were specific for their intended targets except for GPpalm3 which in addition to being extended by ddT when tested with DNA from P. palmivora, was also extended by ddC when tested with DNA from other species of Phytophthora or Pythium.
 
 These primers were also tested for their ability to detect multiple Phytophthora species in a single reaction (multiplexing). Mixtures of primers were added to mixed DNA templates and the primer extension reaction carried out. The primers were designed so that their masses were sufficiently different for them to be identified from a mixture. Six replicates were analysed for each reaction. In general only about 1-3 of the six replicates gave a positive reaction. This indicates that there may be some interference between primers, or that the presence of all four nucleotides interfered with the primer extension reaction. Increasing either the amount of enzyme, the amount of nucleotides or both did not improve the results.
 
 The sensitivity of detection was tested by the addition of different amounts of mycelium to soil. The detection sensitivity depended on the primer pair used for PCR amplification. The ITS1/2 primer pair was more sensitive than the ITS1/4 pair. The limit of detection was 1 mcg mycelium g soil-1. However using nested PCR, levels of sensitivity comparable to those obtained using the ITS1/2 primer pair could be achieved. Primers to other regions of the genome such as the beta cinnamomin elicitin gene gave very low levels of sensitivity compared to the ITS primers.
 
 In comparison with DNA detection we found that the limit of detection using baiting was 4 mcg mycelium g soil-1. Results below this limit were unreliable. The method suffered from the additional disadvantage that it took a long time in comparison to DNA detection.
 
 DNA detection methods do not distinguish between living and dead organisms in the soil. However it can be hypothesised that DNA is unlikely to persist for any significant length of time in soil. To test this, we added plasmid DNA to soil and tested the persistence of this DNA using a variety of methods such as precipitation of labelled DNA, southern blotting and PCR amplification. It was found that in general, in soils from different ecosystems, the bulk of the DNA was undetectable after 24 hours. The rate of DNA breakdown differed with the soil type. In some soils, the added DNA was not detected even after 2 hours, whereas in others it could be observed after 10 hours. The detection depended on the method. Southern blotting showed that although DNA could be observed at 10 hours, by 24 hours it was completely degraded. In contrast a PCR product could be obtained from the soil extracts up to 24 hours. In a separate experiment, plasmid DNA was detectable over a 24 hour incubation period in 5 soil samples from 5 different sites. The results suggest that DNA is degraded rapidly in soil and is unlikely to persist longer than 24 hours.
 
 The results in this thesis demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS is a suitable alternative to agarose gel electrophoresis for analysis of PCR products. The technique is rapid, differentiates species from mixtures, is high-throughput and amenable to automation. Implementation will require further research to automate the primer extension assay to reduce the sensitivity to impurities in the DNA and to design parameters for sampling asymptomatic material.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/314/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local enterprise facilitation</field><field name="creator">Sirolli, Ernesto</field><field name="description">In a rapidly globalizing economy, many communities are stranded in unemployment or work without meaning. This thesis asks the question: can local communities create economic development with fulfilling work? The experience of the author in African development projects is used to pose questions about modernist approaches to development. The alternative approaches to work and human development by Fritz Schumacher, Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers are melded with the political insight of Robert Putnam, to suggest that the answer to the above question can be positive. Their theories are distilled into an approach called Local Enterprise Facilitation, which is based on four principles:
 1. Only work with individuals or communities that invite you.
 2. Do not motivate individuals to do anything they do not wish to do.
 3. Trust that they are naturally drawn towards self-improvement.
 4. Have faith in community and the higher social needs that bond it together.
 
 The author's experience of twenty years in applying and developing this approach is traced from its origins in rural Western Australia, through other parts of Australia and New Zealand to its extensive application in North America. The experience has created a methodology for successful Local Enterprise Facilitation based around a community Board that can provide the necessary support for networks for new enterprises. In particular the methodology uses a 'Trinity of Management' approach whereby the separate skills of production/enterprise, financial accounting and marketing are facilitated as no individual can do more than one of these skills successfully.
 
 The Local Enterprise Facilitation philosophy has many implications and some of these are suggested in terms of planning, education, bureaucracy, and conservation. Whilst an evaluation of the businesses created can only be done in the long term, Local Enterprise Facilitation has opened up some hope for communities seeking to create good work.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/315/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Campsite impact monitoring in the temperate eucalypt forests of Western Australia: an integrated approach</field><field name="creator">Smith, Amanda Jessica</field><field name="description">This study assessed the social and biophysical impacts of camping in the eucalypt forests of southwestern Western Australia. This was an integrated study examining both biophysical and social impacts in designated, developed and informal recreation areas used for camping. Four existing and proposed national parks and a Reserve, comprised of 110 designated and 12 informal campsites, provided the study sites. Previous research has focused on backcountry campsites and trails in wilderness areas in United States. 
	
 A combined survey approach using multiple indicator ratings and measures was used to assess the biophysical impacts of camping. Adjustments to monitoring procedures used in backcountry areas were made so that the indicators were applicable to designated, developed campsites where a management footprint has been imposed. Visitors were surveyed at the designated campsites to establish how existing recreation opportunities were being used. Further, potential indicators and standards were identified to determine what kinds of social and resource conditions were acceptable to visitors and managers. A rating system was then developed combining biophysical and social indicators of importance to visitors and managers with their perceptions of acceptable change obtained from the surveys.
 
 Based on the indices derived from the rating system and results for a suite of associated indicators, designated campsites were significantly less impacted than informal ones. For both campsite types the amount of tree damage and litter exceeded the standards set by 50% of visitors and managers. Both visitors and managers were generally more concerned about biophysical impacts than they were about social ones, although site cleanliness was of concern. Both were generally satisfied with the size and number of groups encountered, in contrast to study findings from the United States. 
 
 This study has developed and successfully applied an integrated approach to monitoring the impacts of recreational use on forested campsites in southwestern Australia. This system effectively and efficiently uses a combination of multiple indicator ratings and measures to produce an impact index, plus social surveys to provide information on conditions, indicators and standards of importance to managers and visitors. It also provides a means for the first time, of objectively monitoring designated, developed campsites where it is inappropriate to judge impacts against an undisturbed control.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/316/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance measurement of Australian geoscientific  minerals researchers in the changing funding regimes</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kerry</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the performance of geoscience minerals researchers from three Australian geoscientific research centres. The study explores whether the changing funding regimes for geoscientific research in Australia have impacted on the research performance of these geoscientists, measured through analysis of activity and output. The context of the study is the literature outlining the settings for the general culture of geoscientific research and the Australian scientific policy and research environment, in particular, including an evaluation of bibliometric methods.
 
 The case study of three geoscience minerals research centres and their researchers finds that journal and book publishing is only one component of the researchers' performance and that conferences, technical reports as well as teaching have an important place in the dissemination of research results. The study also finds that the use of the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) indices not only influences the policy directions for scientific and geoscientific research funding in Australia, but also directs the ways in which the geoscientists publish. It also tends to restrict publishing output: the tail wags the dog.
 
 The study recommends: that the various ways through which research outcomes are disseminated, as well as other components of the research continuum including the processes of education and professional activity, receive wider acceptance and recognition in Australian government policy; that the Australian geoscientific community re-assess its educational and research directions through a considered auditing and strategic planning process; and that a more comprehensive approach to the dissemination of geoscientific research outcomes into the public domain be enacted.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/317/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributions, relative abundances and reproductive biology of the deep-water crabs Hypothalassia acerba and Chaceon bicolor in southwestern Australia</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kimberley Dale</field><field name="description">Three species of large crab are found in Western Australian waters, namely the champagne crab Hypothalassia acerba, the crystal crab Chaceon bicolor and the giant crab Pseudocarcinus gigas, all of which are fished commercially in these waters. This thesis reports the results of studies carried out on the biology of the first two species, for which there were previously very little information. The results increase our knowledge of the benthic fauna in deeper waters off the southwestern Australian coast and provide data that can be used by fisheries managers to develop plans for conserving the stocks of H. acerba and C. bicolor.
 
 The champagne crab Hypothalassia acerba is found southwards of Kalbarri at ~ 27 degrees S, 114 degrees E on the west coast and eastwards to Eucla at ~ 32 degrees S, 129 degrees E on the south coast. There is a small commercial trap fishery for H. acerba on both the lower west and south coasts of Western Australia. However, on the west coast, H. acerba is managed as a single species fishery, whereas on the south coast it is a component of a multi-species fishery, which also includes the southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii and P. gigas. On the west coast, the commercial catches of H. acerba increased sharply from ~ 1,500 kg in 1989 to reach maximum levels of 30-46,000 kg in 1997-99, reflecting a marked increase in fishing effort. However, it subsequently declined to essentially zero after 2000 due to effort shifting towards fishing for C. bicolor. Catches of H. acerba on the south coast peaked at 26-27,000 kg in 1997-98 but, in contrast to those on the west coast, remained relatively high in 2001 to 2003.
 
 The crystal crab Chaceon bicolor occurs in water depths of ~ 450 to 1220 m around Australia and New Zealand. However the commercial fishery is almost entirely located between Carnarvon on the north-west coast at ~ 25 degrees S, 113 degrees E to approximately Windy Harbor at ~ 35 degrees S, 116 degrees E on the south coast. Commercial catches of C. bicolor in southwestern Australia, which came almost entirely from the lower west coast, rose from very low levels in 1997 to ~ 222,000 kg in 2001 and then remained close to this level in 2002 and 2003. These trends largely reflect an increase in fishing effort.
 
 Hypothalassia acerba was sampled seasonally by setting traps at depths of 35, 90, 145, 200, 255, 310 and 365 m on the west and south coasts of Western Australia. Catch rates on the west and south coasts peaked sharply at depths of 200 and 145 m, respectively, but at similar temperatures of 16 - 17 degrees C. The catches on those coasts contained 69 and 84% males, respectively. The carapace length of H. acerba declined significantly by 4 mm for each 100 m increase in depth. Males attained a greater maximum carapace length than females on both the west coast, i.e. 135 vs 113 mm, and south coast, i.e. 138 vs 120 mm. Furthermore, after adjustment to a common depth of 200 m, the mean carapace length of males was greater than females on both the west coast (96.6 vs 94.6 mm) and south coast (101.5 and 91.4 mm) and the latter difference was significant (p &lt; 0.001). These results thus show that, for H. acerba, (1) the distribution is related to depth and temperature, (2) body size is inversely related to water depth and (3) males grow to a larger size and are more prevalent in catches than females. There was also evidence that the distribution of H. acerba changed slightly with season and that there was spatial partitioning by this species and other large deep water invertebrate predators.
 
 The trends exhibited by reproductive variables demonstrate that H. acerba reproduces seasonally on the lower west coast, with ovaries maturing progressively between July and December and oviposition occurring between January and March. The characteristics of H. acerba on the south coast differed in the following ways from those on the lower west coast. (i) No ovigerous females and only two females with egg remnants were caught. (ii) Ovaries did not develop late yolk granule oocytes until females had reached a larger size. (iii) Investment in gonadal development was less. These results strongly suggest that conditions on the south coast are not as conducive for ovarian development and reproduction and indicate that females migrate from the south to lower west coast for spawning. In contrast to H. acerba, C. bicolor reproduces throughout much or all of the year on the lower west coast, presumably reflecting its occupancy of far deeper waters where environmental conditions vary less during the year. Although the mean weights of ovigerous females of H. acerba and C. bicolor were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05), the mean fecundity of the former species (356,210) was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001) than that of the latter species (192,070). The relatively high fecundity of H. acerba may reflect adaptations by this species to optimise egg production during its relatively short breeding season.
 
 The size at onset of sexual maturity (SOM) of the females of crustacean species, which is often used by fisheries managers for developing management plans for such species, is typically estimated using logistic regression analysis of the proportions of mature females in sequential size classes. The validity of this approach depends on the composition of the samples reflecting accurately that present in the environment. However, catches obtained by traps, a passive fishing method, typically contain disproportionately greater numbers of large crabs, whereas those obtained using active fishing methods, such as seine netting and otter trawling, will presumably represent far better the size composition of the population. Since H. acerba and C. bicolor could be caught in numbers only by using traps, comparisons between the influence of passive and active fishing methods were explored using the extensive data previously collected for Portunus pelagicus employing different sampling methods (de Lestang et al. 2003a,b). These data are analysed in order to demonstrate that the females of P. pelagicus caught by trapping were predominantly mature, whereas those obtained by seining and trawling contained numerous immature as well as mature females. The samples of females collected by trap are, therefore, clearly biased towards mature crabs. Consequently, for any size class, it would be predicted that the proportion of mature females in trap catches will be overestimated, thus shifting the logistic curve fitted to the proportions of mature crabs at each size to the left, and thereby yielding an underestimate of the SOM. This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that the carapace width of female P. pelagicus, at which 50% of individuals reach maturity (SOM50), was estimated to be markedly greater when using the proportion of mature females obtained by seine-netting and otter trawling collectively, i.e. 101.1 mm, than by trapping, i.e. 86.1 mm. From the above data for P. pelagicus, it is considered likely that, through a greater vulnerability of mature females of these species to capture by traps, the respective SOM50s derived for female H. acerba and C. bicolor from trap samples (i.e. carapace lengths of 69.7 and 90.5 mm) will represent considerable underestimates of the true SOM50s.
 
 Many workers have assumed that the chelae of male crabs undergo a change in allometry at the pubertal moult and that this could thus be used as the basis for determining the size of those crabs at morphometric maturity. Since initial plots of the logarithms of propodus length and carapace width (CW) of the males of P. pelagicus and carapace length (CL) of the males of H. acerba and C. bicolor revealed no conspicuous change in allometry, the question of whether the chelae of these species undergo such an allometric change was explored statistically. The Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria were thus used to ascertain whether a linear, quadratic, broken stick or overlapping-lines model best represented the above logarithmic size data. Since the broken stick model provided the best fit for P. pelagicus, the chelae of this species does undergo allometric change. This occurred at 80.0 mm CW, which is ~ 8 mm less than the CW at physiological maturity. In contrast, my analyses provided no evidence that the chelae of either H. acerba or C. bicolor exhibited an inflection and thus morphometric maturity could not be determined for these two species from chela length. Thus, mangers will have to use the SOM50 for physiological maturity, which was estimated to be 68.1 and 94.3 mm CL for H. acerba and C. bicolor, respectively.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/318/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the relationships between individualism and collectivism and attitudes towards counselling among ethnic Chinese, Australian, and American university students</field><field name="creator">Snider, Paul Dabney</field><field name="description">Compensating for reduced public funding, Australian and American universities actively recruit full-fee paying East Asian international students. University staff, aware of international students having difficulties coping with cultural and emotional issues, often encourage them to seek university counselling services. However, East Asian international students under-utilise Western universities? counselling services.
 
 It has been argued that the Western concept of counselling reflects Western cultural values, in particular individualism. Thus the reluctance of international students from more collectivistic cultures to seek counselling services may in part be due to a clash of cultural values. Over a decade ago, Draguns hypothesised the existence of a relationship between Hofstede's cultural dimensions of individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity, and their influence on individuals' attitudes towards psychopathology and treatment modalities. The current study sought to offer empirical support for Draguns' hypothesis as it related to individualism and power distance, and to attitudes towards counselling. In place of Hofstede's cultural dimensions, this study used the Triandis cultural concepts of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism.
 
 Using the Triandis Individualism Collectivism Scale (ICS) and the Tinsley Expectations about Counseling-Brief Form (EAC-B)questionnaire, the current study explores the relationship between levels of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, and attitudes towards the roles of counsellors, the roles of clients, and the process and goals of counselling. The research is based on data collected from three cultural groups: ethnic Chinese international students attending Australian universities, and Australian and American university students enrolled in their home countries.
 
 This study is unusual in cross-cultural research owing to its use of the Rasch extended logistic model of modern item response theory (IRT) as a means of validating the data prior to standard statistical analysis. Whereas classical test theory emphasises the model fitting the data, the Rasch model of IRT requires that the data fit the model to be considered valid. Psychometric analysis of the ICS found its four scales separately fit the Rasch model quite well, as did three modified scales of the EAC-B. 
 
 The IRT analysis also provided a means of identifying differential item functioning (DIF), that is, items functioning differently (demonstrating bias) among the three cultural groups.
 
 Using the EAC-B to collect pre and post-intervention data, the current study assessed the effectiveness of a videotape intervention as a means of changing within and between-group attitudes towards counselling. It was anticipated that ethnic Chinese participants, representing the group with the least familiarity with counselling, would show the greatest change in counselling attitudes as a result of the intervention. Americans were expected to show the least change, and Australian participants to be in the middle position. Based on the findings, the intervention did not significantly alter the participants' attitudes towards counselling regardless of their cultural background. Overall, the intervention served to strengthen existing attitudes.
 
 Lastly as a means of gaining a deeper understanding of the quantitative findings, the study collected qualitative data from the participants and from university counsellors. These findings indicated that there was a general lack of knowledge about university counselling services even among those participants who were familiar with counselling as a concept. Participants, in general, expressed reservations about seeking counselling due to concerns of being seen by friends. This was particularly true for the Chinese. Chinese participants also expressed scepticism towards a non-Chinese counsellor's ability to understand their problems.
 
 In reference to Draguns' hypothesis, overall the findings from this study supported his model. The findings indicated that individuals endorsing collectivistic attitudes expressed a strong preference for counsellors who were direct, expert-like, and helped clients seek concrete solutions to their problems. The study also found that an individual's expressions of cultural dimensions, such as vertical collectivism, were better predictors of counsellor preference than an individual's cultural background.
 
 These findings have implications for university policy makers who are responsible for ensuring the existence of an infrastructure capable of meeting the needs of the international students they so actively recruit. This would include appropriate funding for an adequate and diverse counselling staff extending itself to the university community. There are also implications for counsellor education programs in recognising the link between cultural variables and client expectations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/319/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industry capacity building with respect to market-based approaches to greenhouse gas reduction: U.S. and Australian perspectives</field><field name="creator">Sonneborn, Carrie</field><field name="description">Fossil fuel-intensive companies are coming under increasing pressure to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The political environment surrounding climate change and the evolution of the carbon market are complex and in a fluid state of play. Uncertainty exists with respect to government policy, greenhouse (GH) accounting standards, interaction with stakeholders and the capacity to 'commoditise' carbon emissions, making it difficult for companies to determine exactly how to build their internal capacity to deal with a shifting external situation.
 
 In Australia and the United States in particular, companies are receiving mixed messages from government about the necessity of reducing GHGs and the role of emissions trading. While market-based approaches to GHG reduction are being promoted, the governments of both countries have refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and failed to establish domestic emissions trading schemes. Finally, few companies have substantial experience in managing GHGs or in market-based approaches to GHG abatement, such as emissions trading.
 
 This research aims to provide guidance for industry capacity building with respect to market-based approaches to GHG reduction, recognising that generally this would require significant organisational learning and change to corporate systems. The proposed Framework facilitates organisational learning that goes beyond the detection and correction of errors to questioning and modifying existing norms and procedures and, further, to reflecting on past experience and creating new strategies.
 
 The research included participants as integral to the study, giving their 'emic' (insider) viewpoints centrality while allowing 'etic' (outsider / researcher) interpretation. Within the organisational learning literature, the approach that best describes this research is that of Action Research and Appreciative Inquiry. The principles of environmental management, cleaner production, corporate social responsibility and sustainable development inform the research. Surveys, focus groups and a literature review are employed as the data collection methods, which are compared and contrasted.
 
 The data suggest that a 'one size fits all' approach to industry capacity building with respect to market-based approaches to GHG reduction is not optimal or possible. This is due to the differing strategic objectives, varying assessment of risk and disparate circumstances and starting points of the companies involved. Thus, rather than a prescriptive model, this research has identified and prioritised the key themes and issues that currently influence corporate capacity building. Precursors to action have been specified and a 'menu' of choices provided. Lastly, a step-by-step Framework has been proposed to build companies' capacity to participate in GHG emissions trading. It was also observed that the majority of the key themes and issues that influence companies and the preparatory actions they need to take are the same, whether a market-based system or a command-and-control system of GHG reduction is introduced. 
 
 The thesis includes some suggestions for further research in the application and evaluation of this approach with companies in the field.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/320/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The exercise physiology of the racing greyhound</field><field name="creator">Staaden, Ross</field><field name="description">Greyhounds were trained to gallop at maximal running speed on a treadmill constructed for the purpose. This speed considerably exceeded maximal aerobic speed and was termed supramaximal.
 
 A mask was used to collect expired gases into bags during runs of 7.5 to 60 seconds and over the first 8-10 minutes of the recovery period. Respiratory parameters measured included VE, V02' VC02', R, fR', VT' ventilatory equivalent of O2 uptake and ventilatory equivalent of CO2 production. Respiration was found to be synchronised with the gallop stride, enabling both a high fR and VT. Mean VE reached 6 1.kg-1.min-1. Mean V02 reached 143ml.kg-l.min-l during the 30-45 second segment of running. Lactic acid draining into the blood stream displaced CO2 from the bicarbonate buffer system, so that R rose above 1.0. The highest value of R, 2.3 occurred in the second minute of recovery.
 
 The alactacid debt of the greyhound was found to be higher than that of man but was repaid much more rapidly because of the greyhound's superior oxygen transport system. 
 
 The cardiovascular system was studied using electromagnetic and thermodilution flowmeters, and a heart rate telemeter. Changes in blood pressure caused changes in the relationship of the very elastic aortic root and the electromagnetic transducer cuff so that accurate calibration was not possible. Reliable values of cardiac output were obtained by thermodilution. Parameters measured included HR, cardiac output, SV and PCV taken before, during and for 1 hour after running. The minimum HR whilst sleeping was also obtained, and averaged 42 b min .-1  The HR was highest during runs of 30 seconds, 318 plus/minus18 b min -1. After running it fell sharply to below 160 in the second minute of recovery then rose to 200b.min-l 10 minutes after 30 and 45 second runs. HR was close to resting levels 1 hour after running. PCV after 30 seconds of running was 63.5 + 2.1% and had returned to resting values by 1 hour. Cardiac output during high speed runs was 914 + 209ml.kg-l.min-l while SV at 2.9 + 0.6ml. kg-l was increased 32% above resting SV.
 
 Acid-base balance of jugular venous blood was studied. Comparisons with arterial samples taken at the same time showed a useful relationship of arterial and jugular venous blood for lactate, base excess and pH. The time taken for blood lactate to reach its peak value varied with the intensity and the duration of the run. The jugular venous blood lactate level after 45 of running peaked at 181 plus or minus l5mg.dl-l (7 minutes after seconds running) , pH fell to 7.094 plus or minus 0.27, base excess to -23.4 plus or minus 2.7 mEq.l-l and PC02 to 23 + 2 mm Hg. All values had returned to resting level 1 hour after the run.
 
 Oxygen consumption during running, alactacid debt, lactate production and distance covered were used to calculate total energy cost and relative contributions of energy sources and energy cost.m -1. Anaerobic sources were the main contributors in the first 15 seconds but in the 15-30 second segment aerobic sources supplied 53% of the energy required and in the 30-45 second segment, 79%. The energy source contributions to30 seconds of running were aerobic 30%, alactacid debt 19% and lactic acid 51%. The energy cost.m-l at supramaximal speeds was higher than predicted by formulae derived from studies of dogs at submaximal speeds. The first 7.5 seconds of running cost almost as much as the next 22.5 seconds, indicating a high cost of acceleration. This is the first quantification of the energy cost of acceleration reported.
 
 Compared to man, the greyhound has a very high oxygen uptake during sprinting. Man's major deficiencies as a sprinter are a low maximal heart rate, small heart relative to body size and low PCV. Sprinting impedes respiration in man but aids it in the greyhound. Calculations indicate that when man runs at supramaximal speed, it costs more per metre than predicted by formulae derived at submaximal speeds and that the energy cost of acceleration is of the same order as in the greyhound although man attains a much lower peak speed.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/321/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the metal-containing granules in the mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Velesunio angasi</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Frances Jean</field><field name="description">There is a continuing need to develop a simple and reliable biomonitoring technique for pollutants in aquatic systems. Mytilid mussels have been used extensively around the world for monitoring a range of pollutants. However the analysis of soft tissues in such programmes has some drawbacks, one of which is the large amount of variation between individuals in levels of specific pollutant. In order to assess the suitability of lysosomal kidney granules for such a role, it must be established that they are involved in the accumulation and detoxification of pollutants, and the range of change within the granules must also be assessed. 
 
 The structure and composition of intracellular metal-containing granules extracted from the kidney of the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis from a non-polluted site have been examined using a variety of techniques. Comparisons were made between granules extracted from these mussels and those loaded with zinc in the laboratory, and those exposed to excess levels of zinc in the field. In addition, intracellular and extracellular metal-containing granules have been extracted from the freshwater mussel, Velesunio angasi and examined using similar techniques. 
 
 Granules isolated from the kidney tissue of fifty M. galloprovincialis (using a centrifugation process) were pooled to produce a single sample. Inductively-coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) revealed that the concentration of zinc in the kidney granules increased with the level of zinc-loading from a mean value of 5 260 mcg.g-1 in freshly harvested animals to 12 487 mcg.g-1 in animals loaded with 2.5 mcg.g-1 zinc for 28 days. The other main elements present in the granules were phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, calcium, iron and copper. Granules from mussels exposed to excess zinc in the field had a greater concentration of zinc (13 570 mcg.g-1) than both field control animals (1 424 mcg.g-1) and the mussels loaded at the highest level of zinc in the laboratory. Silicon was also present in the granules extracted from the field-contaminated mussels.
 
 Both light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of kidney tissue from M. galloprovincialis loaded with zinc in the laboratory showed signs of increasing degeneration as the level of zinc-loading increased. All cells examined contained membrane-bound granules. The kidney tissue of the field-contaminated mussels, despite containing high levels of zinc and many granules, showed no signs of degeneration. 
 
 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the granules revealed that they were spherical in shape, while energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the isolated granules confirmed the results of the ICP analysis with regard to elemental composition. TEM also revealed that the granules themselves underwent structural changes as the level of zinc-loading increased. Thus, granules extracted from freshly harvested animals were electron-dense and regular in shape while zinc-loading produced granules with a concentric ring formation. In kidney tissue from mussels that were maintained in clean seawater for 14 days following 28 days of zinc-loading, the majority of the granules visible had the concentric ring formation. Granules with concentric rings were not found in kidney cells of the field-contaminated mussels. The number of multivesicular bodies in individual kidney cells also increased during zinc-loading and a positive relationship exists between the number of these bodies and the mean diameter of the granules in the cells. 
 
 The lack of degeneration in the cells of the kidney tissue in the field-contaminated mussels is almost certainly due to the fact that these animals were subjected to a chronic excess of zinc, rather than an acute dose as occurred in the laboratory-loaded animals. Presumably, this longer time period allows the animal to adapt and establish defence mechanisms, including the production of granules. 
 
 The acute exposure to zinc, combined with the stress of being kept in the laboratory, may also have resulted in the appearance of granules with concentric rings in the laboratory zinc-loaded mussels. 
 
 In the freshwater mussel Velesunio angasi, extracellular granules were found mainly on the labial palps, mantle edge, gills and the junction between the foot and the visceral mass. ICP of pooled granules and EDS analysis of isolated granules showed that calcium, phosphorus, iron, manganese and barium were the major elements present. Two types of intracellular granules were isolated from the kidney cells of V. angasi, the first time this has been recorded. The first was similar in composition to the extracellular granules and it was hypothesised that these two groups of granules are actually insoluble deposits of metal phosphates, despite being membrane-bound in the kidney cells. The second type of intracellular granule was mainly composed of phosphorus and sulphur and was possibly lysosomal. 
 
 It appears that difficulties with extraction of the granules and the analysis of the samples preclude the use of the metal-containing kidney granules of either M. galloprovincialis or V. angasi as biomarkers. The use of other biomarkers for pollutant contamination in mussels is discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/322/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Declared guilty, a never-ending story: an analysis of the impact of the criminal justice system upon the self</field><field name="creator">Steels, Brian</field><field name="description">This study explores the experience of people who have been publicly declared guilty. It retells the narratives of offenders from the point of arrest through to conviction and, where relevant, imprisonment and release. The experiences of close relatives are also explored and provide an important part of the thesis. These accounts are set against the institutional context of the criminal justice system and a systemic account of police, courts, prisons and community corrections is provided. The main aim of the study is to investigate and document the impact of the criminal justice process on offenders' sense of 'self'.  
 
 At a theoretical level, the study is informed by symbolic interactionism, particularly the work of Erving Goffman. This enables the development of insights into issues such as loss, shame, humiliation and loss of self. The asymmetrical power relationship in which these feelings are engendered and maintained is emphasised. At the same time, the study records the level and types of resistance among the subjects of the criminal justice system.
 
 The findings are significant for our sociological understandings of the impact of being declared guilty, for they suggest that the criminal justice process per se contributes to a severely damaged self, and that the subjective experience of 'being found guilty' starts at the moment of arrest and persists well after sentencing as subjects try to re-integrate into the community with a record of conviction. 
 
 The study also suggests that these processes are not passively absorbed by subjects. As well as describing feelings of shame and loss, those participating in the research talked about the unfairness of the system, their preparedness to resist in numerous ways, and of their longing for an older, better life in which their sense of self was undamaged. 
 
 The study concludes by arguing that profound change to the culture of the criminal justice system is needed if rehabilitation is to be successful. In this context it emphasises the importance of accountable and transparent human services concerned with the human and civil rights of offenders, court diversion schemes, alternatives to custody, and the practical application of restorative and therapeutic justice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/323/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Baby graves: infant mortality in Merthyr Tydfil 1865-1908</field><field name="creator">Beresford, Linda</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the problem of infant mortality in Merthyr Tydfil 1865-1908. In particular it investigates why Merthyr Tydfil, an iron, steel and coal producing town in south Wales, experienced high infant mortality rates throughout the nineteenth century which rose by the end of the century despite sixty years of public health reforms. The historiography of infant mortality in nineteenth-century Britain includes few Welsh studies although the south Wales Coalfield played an important part in industrial and demographic change in Britain during the second half of the nineteenth century. The thesis argues that conditions of industrial development shaped the social, economic and public health experience in Merthyr, ensnaring its citizens in social disadvantage, reflected in the largely unacknowledged human toll among mothers and babies in that process.
 
 The thesis analyses the causes of over 17, 000 infant deaths in Merthyr Tydfil from the primary evidence of an unusually complete series of Medical Officer of Health Reports to identify the principal attributed causes of infant death and explain their social origins and context. The thesis examines the work of Dr. Thomas Jones Dyke, MOH from 1865-1900, who was the author of most of these reports, and assesses his career in public health, but suggests that there were limits to his capacity to address the problem of infant mortality. The analysis showed convulsions, tuberculosis, measles and whooping cough, lung diseases, diarrhoea, nutritional causes of death and infant deaths from antenatal causes of maternal origin to be those which drove up infant mortality rates in Merthyr from the 1880s. From 1902 antenatal causes of infant death, independent of the sanitary environment, and directly linked to the health of mothers, were the only ones still rising.
 
 Public health reforms were unable to address the social factors which engendered poverty and ill-health. Large families dependent mainly on male breadwinners had little margin of economic safety. Industrial conflicts in Merthyr revealed the inability of the Poor Law to address the problems of mass destitution in an urban setting. Women experienced few employment opportunities, married early and undertook heavy domestic labour reflected in early death rates for women and high perinatal infant death rates due to the poor health and socio-economic status of mothers. The training of midwives from 1902, with the potential to save many infant lives and to advocate for working-class mothers, failed to do so in Merthyr by 1908.
 
 Although specifically addressing the issues of infant mortality in nineteenthcentury Britain, the issues raised are of contemporary relevance since infant deaths reflect many social dynamics of inequality through which infant lives are inevitably sacrificed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/324/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Chinese combat film since 1949: variants of 'regulation', 'reform' and 'renewal'</field><field name="creator">Stein, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis examines variations of the Chinese 'combat film', from its origins within cinema in 1949, through to the contemporary period. My argument transposes the critical approach of 'genre', as a popular style within conventional film criticism, to a specific Chinese form. In particular, this study investigates the 'combat film' as a prevailing mode in Chinese cinema, with a particular history, form of progression and set of aesthetics.   
 
 The argument initially applies the 'war film' and 'combat genre' categorisations to Chinese forms. Consequently three major variants emerge, manifest in the 'regulated' (1949-1966), 'reformed' (1980s) and 'renewed' (1990s) styles, respectively. These modes are subsequently examined in rigorous narratological and cinematic contexts, resulting in an expanded conception of the Chinese 'combat' film.
 
 This thesis offers an integrative appreciation of variegations of the Chinese 'combat film' since 1949, sutured to wider discursive and socio-political changes within the country. Moreover, this argument produces a framework for a more expansive and complex comprehension of Chinese cinema, one undergoing continual modes of re-negotiation as the medium progresses into the Twenty First Century.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/325/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conservation status of aquatic insects in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Sutcliffe, Karen Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Freshwater ecosystems in south-western Australia have been extensively altered over the last two centuries as a result of human activities. The effect this has had on aquatic fauna, particularly invertebrates, is largely unknown because of inadequate knowledge of the pre-existing fauna. Future changes in the composition of aquatic fauna will also go undetected unless current distributions of existing species are well documented.
 
 This thesis addresses the problem by investigating the current distributions and conservation status of aquatic insects in south-western Australia from three orders: Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. Extensive distributional data was collected by identifying larval specimens from a large number of samples collected throughout the south-west as part of an Australia-wide macroinvertebrate bioassessment project. In addition, a database created from a species-level biological study of the wheatbelt region of Western Australia was utilised, and previously published records of occurrence for species within the south-west were compiled. These results were then used to assess the conservation status of each species using the IUCN red list criteria.
 
 Environmental parameters measured at time of sampling were also examined using logistic regression to determine which factors are important in influencing the distributions of aquatic insects in south-western Australia. The conservation value of sites based on Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera compositions was also determined and the degree of protection provided for sites of high conservation value investigated. The high rainfall forested region of the south-west was found to be important for a large number of species, including the majority of those found to be rare and/or restricted.
 
 Overall, 37% of species were found to be threatened, with the Trichoptera containing both the greatest number and highest proportion of threatened species. Logistic regression results generally agreed with the distributions obtained for each species, with rainfall and other parameters indicative of streams in the headwaters of forested catchments being positively associated with species found to be restricted to the high rainfall region. Two parameters known to be affected by human disturbance in the south-west, conductivity and nutrient concentrations, were found to be important in determining the occurrence of many species and this could have important consequences for aquatic insect conservation. Widespread species occurring within the low rainfall region of the south-west did not show as many significant relationships to measured environmental parameters, possibly due to their greater ecological tolerances and adaptations which allow them to persist in a low rainfall environment. The implications of results are discussed, and recommendations for the conservation and management of aquatic insects in south-western Australia are given.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/327/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reform of minor cannabis laws in Western Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Swensen, Greg</field><field name="description">The past three decades has been a period of intense and sustained debate in a number of major Western countries about the wisdom of police continuing to apply legislation which can severely punish offenders by fines and even imprisonment because of laws and policies that prohibit the use, possession and cultivation of cannabis.
 
 The large and growing number of young adults who have been exposed to the drug, some of whom have been charged and received criminal convictions with attendant deleterious effects on their employment and wellbeing, has forced policy makers to re-evaluate the justification for continuing to criminalise cannabis. 
 
 This thesis examines in detail the law reforms that occurred in early 2004 with respect to cannabis offenders in Western Australia (WA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and what lessons these reforms may hold for other jurisdictions interested in decriminalisation of minor cannabis offences. 
 
 A study was undertaken to compare the shortcomings and advantages of the different approaches to reform followed in WA and the UK. Reference to the reform in the UK, will be confined to meaning England, Wales and Northern Ireland as the necessary administrative guidelines have not so far been issued for Scotland. 
 
 In WA the reforms required a substantial legislative effort to establish a complex framework that outlined in detail the circumstances when police may issue cannabis infringement notices (CINs), whereas in the UK the approach involved limited legislative activity by the reclassification of the legal status of cannabis and by providing police with administrative guidelines issued by the Association of Chief Police Commissioners as to how to exercise their discretion in issuing formal warnings for a minor cannabis offence. 
 
 A comparison is made with New Zealand (NZ), where in spite of  there being a similar process of deliberation and consultation as in WA and the UK, the government refused to implement formal reform because of a perception it was unable to decriminalise minor cannabis offences because of the restrictions imposed of agreement between the Clarke Labour Government and a minor political party. 
 
 The example of the failure of government in NZ to achieve reform illustrates the importance that in some jurisdictions there will be a significant role for non parliamentary advisory bodies and lobby groups to argue for reform and to garner public support when reform has stalled or been frustrated.
 
 The thesis also includes a preliminary exploratory study using a number of indicators, such as prevalence and conviction data, to determine if the reforms implemented by the CIN scheme have resulted in or are likely to create unanticipated harms and to explore some of the issues in being to determine whether changes in law enforcement practices and priorities have impacted on the cannabis market or are likely to change the way cannabis may be transacted in WA.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/328/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Values and identity in public relations practice in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Synnott, Gae</field><field name="description">This is a study of values and identity within the public relations profession in Malaysia. Although the study has a national focus, its implications are global, because its context is created by the intersection of three current areas of debate and examination: I) the renewed focus on Asian values which seeks to articulate Asian values as a way of supporting Asia's pathway to modernisation; 2) the open challenge to assumptions about the transferability of theory between countries around the world, about whether theory can be universal or whether different theories or different versions of theories are needed to help explain practice in different parts of the world; and 3) the reemerging focus on values underwriting the public relations profession.
 
 Malaysia's growing public relations profession is playing a crucial communication role in support of the country's move towards industrialisation. In Malaysia, issues of culture, modernisation, Westernisation, and globalisation are both real and topical.
 
 Through the values framework, the study aims to contribute in three ways: 1) To develop and test an alternative, but equally useful, framework and method for comparing public relations practice between countries; 2) to investigate the influence of specific cultural and professional variables on public relations practice in Malaysia, to hrther understand specific variables which might lead public relations practice to differ between countries; and 3) to contribute to the definition of Asian values by defining one component, that is, the personal and professional values of a sample of public relations practitioners in Malaysia.
 
 The research was undertaken in two parts. The first, using a survey and structured interviews, examined the influence of two cultural variables (ethnicity and gender) and two professional variables (years of experience and work environment) on values held. Ethnicity and years of experience led to significant differences in the values held, with each variable influencing different value dimensions. Gender and work environment had some influence but generally in combination with ethnicity and years of experience respectively. The study found a distinctive U-shaped curve related to years of experience, which means that practitioners' value priorities change as they gain more experience in the profession. All four of the variables studied could be significant in accounting for difference in professional practice in other countries.
 
 The second part, using repertory grid methodology, examined values and identity. It identified core values central to public relations practice in Malaysia, and interpreted these core values as statements of self-identity. The nature of identity as a public relations practitioner may also account for differences in public relations practice between countries.
 
 Combining both parts, the study has revealed values that underwrite public relations practice in Malaysia, the aspects of self-identity important to the profession, and the way in which those values and identity have been influenced by cultural and professional factors. It therefore leads towards the development of a theoretical foundation for culture-specific public relations in Malaysia.
 
 This exploratory study has generated findings which challenge the expectations of Schwartz and Bilsky's values theory, on which the values analysis was based.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/329/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing megacities: a case study of metroplitan regional governance for Dhaka</field><field name="creator">Talukder, Sirajul Haq</field><field name="description">Megacities of over 10 million population are a phenomenon not seen before in human history. Among 19 Megacities, 14 are in developing countries and 11 are in Asia. Dhaka represents one of the most extreme examples of rapid Megacity growth having a mere 129,000 at the start of the 20th century, 417,000 by 1950 and more than 12 million in 2001.
 
 How can a city be governed that has increased 30 times in size over a person?s lifetime? This thesis makes a case for integrated Metropolitan Regional Governance (MRG) of the Extended Metropolitan Region of Dhaka.
 
 The growing problems of Asian Megacities in general and Dhaka in particular are outlined, showing how governance has developed in a sectoral and national way rather than being place oriented. This has fractured and become totally inadequate as a means of solving the deep environmental, social and economic problems of the Megacity.
 
 The governance issues of Megacities are traced to the primary problem of the need for integrative functions in strategic and statutory planning as well as development facilitation of the Extended Metropolitan Region (EMR). Ten core principles of Metropolitan Regional Governance are established. Without this, the Megacity's functions of infrastructure, investment, housing, environmental management, employment etc. are not coordinated or prioritised in ways that lead to 'common good' sustainability outcomes.
 
 The ten principles are applied to four Asian Megacities - Metro-Manila, Tokyo, Bangkok and Jakarta - to confirm their relevance and application before applying them to Dhaka.
 
 The problems of Dhaka are outlined then an analysis of Dhaka governance options is attempted based on the ten core principles of MRG. Four possibilities are analysed and a way forward is suggested combining the options.
 
 The proposed structure will build on the present system with greater responsibilities for strategic planning, statutory planning and development facilitation. It will also build up municipalities through a more transparent and engaged local planning process and create partnerships for infrastructure development.
 
 The proposed governance structure would use the dynamism of the Megacity to create sustainable solutions and hope for the future of the city. The key to implementation will be finding the political solution to make such painful change, and training professionals in the broad integrative skills of urban sustainability and community engagement that are required for the region as well as the participation and partnership skills at local level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/330/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective space (looking back)</field><field name="creator">Tampalini, Sergio</field><field name="description">It may be argued that a historically accepted model of an academic career begins with having completed a PhD and in so doing identifying a body of theory that will inform and constitute one's practical academic work. While it may be an accepted model it does not necessarily take precedence as the only model. The relationship between theory and practice is symbiotic and as such it is possible, and indeed at times desirable, that practice inform theory. It is not advisable to be solely operating from a position of theory when making creative work; the risk is far too great.
 
 The gravitational force of theory can all too easily disturb the fragile innocence of creativity. Pulled and constrained by the logic of theory the work risks becoming too didactic and its creativity sacrificed for the sake of rationalism...a symptom almost diagnostic of our culture.
 
 I appreciate that the term creative is open to a plethora of readings, each with their own cogent claim to usage. When I employ the term I am referring to a particular type of decision-making process involved in the solution of problems. I will argue that a creative decision differs from other types of decisions [such as, practical or scientific] in the way the resultant solution of the problem remains open to a greater number of potential readings. I will also argue that it is precisely in those heuristic moments of potential impasse, often associated with a problem's resolution, where creativity hangs out.
 
 In any creative venture, I have always been guided by the importance and significance of doing...in the doing is the theory. This is not meant to dismiss theory but simply to see it in much the same way as when we see objects in our peripheral vision. Just as objects in our peripheral vision do not take their place in our visual field, theory [for me] participates in creative processes by subconsciously serving as an early guiding system that helps monitor the work. In this age of information we are no longer innocent of theory -it is ineluctable. What is crucial is that we have a command of theory in order that we may go through it and regain our creative innocence. If we do not, we only achieve an artificial innocence born of enthusiasm, exuberance and imprecision. Creative innocence is re-found in doing. This assertion conceives of theory as participating as part of a creative subconscious and goes someway towards explaining the sudden epiphany of understanding that is frequently associated with prolonged and intense work, or the immense pleasure at retrospectively recognising the theory that seemed to have informed one's work without being conscious of it -as if the theoretical component had always been there. This phenomenon is of fundamental concern to my thesis, especially when considering the theatre productions that constitute my creative oeuvre. Upon close inspection, my works ultimately reveal that the defining distance between a visceral creative decision [one whose manifestation is immediately felt as apposite] and one that is conceptualised as the illustration of a theory, is not that great...I just happen to begin working outside of the brackets of theoretical narration.
 
 Throughout my thesis I will refer to all visuals as images but I will argue that there are specific types of images, namely signs, symbols and metaphors.
 
 In language the term image can imply more than a verbal description of a purely visual experience; it can also mean the metaphoric, ornamental, rhetorical figurative use of language as opposed to its literal use.
 
 For the surrealists image meant more than the representation of an external thing in the material world, it also meant the revelation of an internal mental state, a psychological verity occluded from consciousness.
 
 Images [of this kind] were incandescent flashes linking two elements belonging to categories that are so far removed from each other that reason would fail to connect them and that require a momentary suspension of the critical attitude in order for them to be brought together.
 
 Having already built a body of practical work [spanning thirty years] the challenge was to see if it was possible to identify a coherent theory that consistently functioned as the catalyst of the work - albeit disparate in its nature. The analytical process proved to be the reverse of that which may be observed in the historically accepted model of academic discourse...where the process is cumulative. In this instance the process was deductive -a forensic assignment akin to tracing the diverse creative elements to their creative source or motivation. The venture proved illuminating in much the same way as when one is asked to crystallise a complex theoretical argument; you have to reinvent the argument in a way that helps to simplify its complexity without attenuating its integrity -a complexity that is well known to you but that eludes the uninitiated reader.
 
 Whenever I try and think about my theatre practice I am vexed -particularly when I filter my own experiences and try and extract the meanings that seem genuinely inherent in them. At first glance it is satisfying because of a sense of coherence or pattern in a whole host of discrete events. However a closer inspection quickly reveals the fractal complexity of the pattern and demands a reappraisal of how we see and decipher it. Any attempt to understand its disparate nature by investigating one part in isolation from the whole proves initially unsatisfying and finally futile, for each part seems to be informed by and refer to other parts, as if participating in a greater organising principle; a principle that resists traditional cartography; one that is best seen as one sees the earth from outer space. When the earth is seen from outer space one becomes aware of the greater organising principle [the universe] within which it functions. Similarly it is only when the topology of my work is seen from a distance that its coherence is apparent...the further away one is, the more clearly one recognises its constituent parts.
 
 Despite our desire to lose ourselves in the living depths of a work, we are constrained to distance ourselves from it in order to speak of it. Why, then not deliberately establish a distance that will reveal to us, in a panoramic perspective, the surroundings with which the work is organically linked?
 
 When I am in the middle of a theatre production, I have only the slightest idea of how it will end; I trust in the doing, and at the end I am always surprised by what I have created. Ambiguity and paradox and consequently indeterminacy ultimately emerge as the common features of my work; they appear as sign posts that mark a way of finally mapping it. Each individual piece of work remains coherently intact despite its seemingly obscure coalescence with others, but it is when the works intersect at these points of commonality that one may observe the greater organising matrix.
 
 The phenomenological world is not a pure being, but the sense which is revealed where the paths of my various experiences intersect, and also where my own and other people's intersect and engage each other like gears.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/331/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting for financial instruments: an investigation of preparer and user preference for fair value accounting</field><field name="creator">Tan, Chyi Woan (Rebecca)</field><field name="description">This research study, motivated by the difference in opinion between the Joint Working Group of Standard Setters (JWGSS) and the Joint Working Group of Banking Associations (JWGBA), generates empirical evidence on preparer and user preferences for fair value accounting for all financial instruments. Australian and Singaporean respondents' perceptions on the measurement of financial instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in fair value as gains or losses in the Income Statement are obtained. This study provides better understanding of the perceptions on the international proposals for change by examining possible explanatory factors for respondents' views.
 
 There is ongoing controversy regarding the appropriate accounting for financial instruments. Perceived shortcomings of the mixed measurement model resulted in an all inclusive fair value accounting standard proposed by the JWGSS (2000). This was met with strong criticism from the JWGBA, established in response to this proposal (1999a). An understanding of actual preparer and user views is thus important for standard-setters to determine the most appropriate and acceptable accounting standard for financial instruments, particularly for the complex financial institutions industry in these two prominent financial markets of the Asian Pacific region.
 
 A positivist-objectivist approach is chosen as the theoretical perspective of this research study because of its ability to help explain real world phenomena. Both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (surveys) methods are used in tandem to derive evidence on user and preparer perceptions. This integration of methods is important to achieve a better understanding of the issues at hand. Evidence collected from the interviews and the preparer and user surveys are analysed with univariate and multivariate statistical tools to determine the level of support (or opposition) for fair value accounting for all financial instruments and to identify factors that explain user and preparer views.  
 
 Results show that on average, preparers neither strongly support nor strongly oppose the fair value accounting proposal, while users are slightly more supportive.  However, respondent users and preparers tend to have similar perceptions on most of the contentious issues raised in this international debate, sometimes giving credence to the JWGBA position while other times agreeing with the JWGSS. On average, users and preparer responses are similar but there is substantial variation within each group. Findings indicate higher support for fair value accounting when the trading and banking books are perceived to be not different, fair values for non-traded financial instruments are reliable and when there is comparability across entities.  
 
 This thesis generates empirical evidence on the highly topical issue of accounting for financial instruments in the midst of international accounting standard setting movements toward fair value accounting. The lack of variation between users and preparers affirms the robustness of the qualitative characteristics espoused by the IASB framework for financial reporting. Results show that achieving these qualitative characteristics is far more important than trying to fulfill the different needs of various groups. This slight support for fair value accounting is part of a bigger tapestry of a slow but steady movement towards fair value measurement in financial accounting and reporting.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/332/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organic corrosion inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Tan, Swee Hain</field><field name="description">The overall aims of this thesis were to conduct a broad survey of possible organic corrosion inhibitors in near-neutral chloride solutions and to elucidate the mechanisms of such action. 
 
 Altogether, 130 organic compounds were studied as possible corrosion inhibitors for pure iron, mild steel, copper and aluminium in aerated near-neutral (pH = 8.4) solutions containing 500 ppm NaCl and 100 ppm NaHCO, conditions often encountered in water-based automotive engine coolants. Inhibitor behaviour was investigated using steady-state electrochemical techniques including polarisation curves, Stern-Geary and corrosion potential (Em,) measurements. The organic compounds examined were found to be highly specific in their inhibitive action toward the metals studied. Typical examples of highly effective corrosion inhibitors were: sebacate and octanoate for pure iron; oleate and sebacate for mild steel; benzotriazole and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole for copper; and laurate and oleate for aluminium. E, was found to provide a rapid and convenient screening test for evaluating the inhibitor performance of organic compounds toward pure iron, mild steel and aluminium but was less useful for copper.
 
 Good organic inhibitors were found to act as anodic inhibitors toward pure iron and mild steel but as anodic or mixed-type inhibitors toward copper. For aluminium, the majority of the compounds studied were found to act as anodic inhibitors. However,However, it was also found that only pit initiation was inhibited, i.e. existing pits were not prevented from developing. Optical microscopy of pitted aluminium surfaces indicated their nature varied considerably with inhibition efficiency. The role of complex formation in organic corrosion inhibitors was found to vary with the metal. Complexation of either iron(I1) or iron(II1) ions was found to have an insignificant effect on mild steel. The corrosion rate of copper was found to increase with the copper(LI) complex stability, thus indicating complex formation to be the rate-determining step. For aluminium, the observed effects were found to depend on complex stability. For weak to moderate complexants, inhibitor efficiency (measured as E,,) increased with increasing complexation. However, very strong complexing agents were sufficiently stable to dissolve the aluminium oxide surface, leading to poor inhibition. Aluminium pit morphology was found, using scanning electron microscopy, to change from hemispherical in the uninhibited solution to irregular in the presence of complexing inhibitors. No simple relationships between inhibitor efficiency and molecular structure were found. However, carbon chain length, the nature of functional group(s) and their location in the molecule were found to be important but varied according to the metal.
 
 The inhibiting ability of sebacate (a straight chain C, dicarboxylate) was found not to be compromised by water movement (stirring) or pre-existing corrosion product layers. Immersion tests showed that passive film formation on mild steel in sebacate solution involved two stages and was complete only after -100 h immersion.
 
 The ion selective properties of several iron(II1) carboxylates and hydrated iron(II1) oxide films were studied by membrane potential measurements in neutral sodium chloride solutions. Some specimens were also studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy. These results show that dicarboxylates are good inhibitors toward mild steel because they form impermeable films. Poor inhibitor performance is associated with the anion selectivity of the film which in turn appears to be related to the film purity. A model is suggested for the inhibition mechanism of mild steel corrosion by dicarboxylates in aerated near-neutral chloride solutions.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/333/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enduring myth of an Okinawan struggle: the history and trajectory of a diverse community of protest</field><field name="creator">Tanji, Miyume</field><field name="description">The islands of Okinawa have a long history of people's protest. Much of this has been a manifestation in one way or another of Okinawa's enforced assimilation into Japan and their differential treatment thereafter. However, it is only in the contemporary period that we find interpretations among academic and popular writers of a collective political movement opposing marginalisation of, and discrimination against, Okinawans. This is most powerfully expressed in the idea of the three 'waves' of a post-war 'Okinawan struggle' against the US military bases. Yet, since Okinawa's annexation to Japan in 1879, differences have constantly existed among protest groups over the reasons for and the means by which to protest, and these have only intensified after the reversion to Japanese administration in 1972.
 
 This dissertation examines the trajectory of Okinawan protest actors, focusing on the development and nature of internal differences, the origin and survival of the idea of a united 'Okinawan struggle', and the implications of these factors for political reform agendas in Okinawa. It explains the internal differences in organisation, strategies and collective identities among the groups in terms of three major priorities in their protest. There are those protesters principally preoccupied with opposing the US-Japan security treaty and for whom the preservation of pacifist clauses of the Constitution and the utilisation of formal legal and political processes are paramount as a modus operandi. There are also those primarily concerned to protect Okinawa's distinctive lifestyle and natural environment, as well as an assortment of feminist groups fundamentally opposed to the presence of US bases due to concerns about patriarchy and exploitation of women, fostered by militarism. In these last two perspectives, protest tends to be conducted much more via informal, network-oriented processes, and includes engagement with international civil society groups.
 
 The increasing range of protest groups derived from the expansion of these last two perspectives, diversifying beyond the traditional workers' unions and political parties, is consistent with the 'new social movement' theory. This theory's emphasis on the importance of socio economic change for the emergence of groups with post-materialist reform agendas and a stronger predisposition towards informal political processes resonates with the Okinawan experiences. However, the impact of this has been, especially after the reversion in 1972, to hinder effective coalition building among the Okinawan protest groups and organisations, weakening their power to bring about political reforms, particularly towards the removal of the US military bases from the island.
 
 Crucially, though, the idea of an 'Okinawan struggle' has endured in the community of protest throughout the post-war period. Ideas about marginalisation of, and discrimination against, Okinawans constitute a powerful myth of an 'Okinawan struggle', which has a long history of being redefined, used and exploited differently by a wide range of protest actors, adjusted to their particular and historically specific struggles. Indeed, in the event that the US military bases were withdrawn from Okinawa, the ability and appeal of the myth of an 'Okinawan struggle' would therefore not necessarily expire, even if it will increasingly be joined by other protest perspectives as a result of the flowering of new social movements.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/334/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing from the shadowlands: how cross-cultural literature negotiates the legacy of Edward Said</field><field name="creator">Tansley, Tangea</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of Edward Said's influential work Orientalism and its legacy in respect of contemporary reading and writing across cultures. It also questions the legitimacy of Said's retrospective stereotyping of early examples of cross-cultural representation in literature as uncompromisingly 'orientalist'.
 
 It is well known that the release of Edward Said's Orientalism in 1978 was responsible for the rise of a range of cultural and critical theories from multiculturalism to postcolonialism. It was a study that not only polarized critics and forced scholars to re-examine orientalist archives, but persuaded creative writers to re-think their ethnographic positions when it came to the literary representations of cultures other than their own. Without detracting from the enormous impact of Said, this thesis isolates gaps and silences in Said that need correcting. Furthermore, there is an element of intransigence, an uncompromising refusal to fine-tune what is essentially a binary discourse of the West and its other in Said's work, that encourages the continued interrogation of power relations but which, because of its very boldness, paradoxically disallows the extent to which the conflict of cultures indeed produced new, hybrid social and cultural formations. 
 
 In an attempt to challenge the severity of Said's claim that 'every European, in what he could say about the Orient, was consequently a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally ethnocentric', the thesis examines a number of different discursive contexts in which such a presumption is challenged. Thus while the second chapter discusses the 'traditional' profession-based orientalism of nineteenth-century E. G. Browne, the third considers the anti-imperialism of colonial administrator Leonard Woolf. The fourth chapter provides a reflection on the difficulties of diasporic 'orientalism' through the works of Michael Ondaatje while chapter five demonstrates the effects of the dialogism used by Amitav Ghosh as a defence against 'orientalism'. The thesis concludes with an examination of contemporary writing by Andrea Levy that appositely illustrates the legacy of Said's influence.
 
 While the restrictive parameters of Said's work make it difficult to mount a thorough-going critique of Said, this thesis shows that, indeed, it is within the restraints of these parameters and in the very discourse that Said employs that he traps himself. This study claims that even Said is susceptible to 'orientalist' criticism in that he is as much an 'orientalist' as those at whom he directs his polemic.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/335/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The thermodynamic chemistry of the aqueous copper-ammonia thiosulfate system</field><field name="creator">Black, Silvia Beatriz</field><field name="description">A fundamental thermodynamic study was undertaken in order to establish the speciation of copper(I) and copper(II) during the leaching and recovery of gold from thiosulfate-copper-ammonia solutions. Despite considerable research into this complex leaching system, the lack of important fundamental chemistry has delayed the implementation of the thiosulfate process as an alternative to cyanidation. Over the last two decades, research in this field has focused on the kinetics and electrochemistry of leaching, which involves the use of copper(II) as an oxidant. However, the fundamental thermodynamic data for copper(I) and copper(II) in this system is limited.
 
 Ion association was found to significantly affect the dissociation constant of the ammonium ion in solutions containing sodium sulfate and/or sodium thiosulfate, thus influencing the free ammonia concentration in solution. These findings highlight the importance of using the correct dissociation constant value in thermodynamic studies that involve ammonia in order to obtain precise stability constants.
 
 It has been established that the mixed-ligand complexes Cu(NH3)(S2O3)23- and Cu(NH3)(S2O3)- exist in solution and they are more stable than the other species Cu(S2O3)35-, Cu(NH3)2+ and Cu(NH3)3+ at high concentrations of ammonia and/or thiosulfate. The relative proportions of each two species is dependant on the [NH3]:[S2O32-] ratio in solution. This is reflected in two- and three- dimensional speciation diagrams that have been constructed for typical leaching and recovery processes using the stability constants obtained in this study. The 3-dimensional diagrams reveal subtle speciation trends that are not easily discernable from the 2-dimensional diagrams.
 
 An investigation into the effect of high sulfate and chloride concentrations showed that these anions are not involved in the complexation with copper(I)-ammonia or copper(I)-ammonia-thiosulfate species under the experimental conditions studied. However, these anions and perchlorate formed relatively stable species with the copper(II)-ammine complexes in the absence of thiosulfate. Stability constants were obtained for the species Cu(NH3)4SO40, Cu(NH3)4Cl+ and Cu(NH3)4ClO4+ and it is suggested that these anionic ligands form outer-sphere complexes with the Cu(NH3)42+ ion.
 
 Various methods of predicting stability constants for mixed-ligand complexes from those for the corresponding single ligand systems have been evaluated for this copper(I) system. Although the results have not been quantitatively accurate, the trends suggest that an appropriate method may serve as a useful qualitative tool to predict the possible existence of mixed-ligand complexes.
 
 The combined application of 2- and 3-dimensional speciation and potential diagrams could be used as a hydrometallurgical tool in the design, optimization and control of possible future processes for the extraction of gold using thiosulfate in the presence of copper ions and ammonia. The work presented in this thesis adds to our understanding of the chemistry of copper(I) and copper(II) in this leaching system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/336/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the factors which influence performance measurement and management in the Thai banking industry: an application of the balanced scorecard framework</field><field name="creator">Tapanya, Sriwan</field><field name="description">Performance measurement is critical to achieving a firm's objectives, translating strategy into action and monitoring progress. Selection of a performance measurement system involves a complex interplay between strategy, a firm's internal and external environment and determination of the relative importance of various measures of performance. 
 
 This dissertation examined the factors which influence performance measurement systems within the context of a highly uncertain and rapidly changing environment via the application of the Balanced Scorecard framework. This framework is a strategic management system and its four pillars of measurement - financial, customers, learning and growth, and internal business process - are influenced by the vision and strategy adopted by the specific organisation.  
 
 Through a series of qualitative and quantitative studies in the Thai banking industry post the 1997 Asian financial crisis, this dissertation shows that institutional forces play a pivotal role in the choice of performance measurement systems, irrespective of strategic orientation and/or firm ownership.  
 
 Specifically, three studies are presented to support this argument.  The first study uses the Miles and Snow (1978) typology to identify the strategic orientation of the Thai banks in order to make some predictions about the type and number of performance measures utilised by these banks.  Results from this study show that bank managers identified their banks' strategy as prospector, defender or analyser irrespective of firm ownership.  This outcome drives the focus of study two.
 
 Study two is a two-part approach examining the forces which have influenced performance measurement in Thailand's banks via both in-depth interviews conducted with 24 branch managers and the administration of a survey to 60 branch managers.  Results from both studies suggest that coercive and mimetic forces play a pivotal role in the choice of performance measures.  In particular, the study demonstrates that coercive forces at play within the industry put pressure on the banks to focus on financial measures, despite the increased awareness that to remain competitive both types of performance measures are needed.
 
 The final study examines whether the focus on financial indicators has impacted upon the non-financial measure of customer satisfaction for the banks, particularly as the Balanced Scorecard approach suggests utilising multidimensional performance measures to achieve the best performance outcome for the firm.  Results from this study suggest that most customers are not satisfied with firm performance and concludes that there is a need, irrespective of social network forces to focus on both financial and non-financial performance indicators.
 
 These outcomes have both theoretical and practical implications.  From a theoretical point of view, this thesis posits that coercive, mimetic and normative forces need to be included in frameworks such as the Balanced Scorecard, if the true picture of what factors influence performance management and measurement are to be understood.  From a practical perspective, the thesis provides evidence to managers of the need to examine performance measurement from a variety of perspectives in order to meet the needs of all stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/337/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young children's construction of 'racial differences' in an Australian context</field><field name="creator">Targowska, Anna Urszula</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to explore how some young Australian children construct their racialised ideas of difference and social relations. It adopts a qualitative method of inquiry and is based on face-to face, semi-structured interviews with a small sample of twelve Western Australian children aged three, five and seven years. 
 
 The study adopts a relatively recent perspective on children, within which they are viewed as having an active role in their own learning process and as possessing a certain level of competence (Lloyd-Smith and Tarr, 2000; James and James, 2004) that allows them to 'comprehend, process and articulate their needs and experiences' (Connolly, 1996, p.172). The study also adopts a perspective of the multiplicity of the forms of racism (Hall, 1986; Miles, 1989, 1993) and their dynamic, contingent nature, specific to different political and social contexts. Within this understanding children are viewed not just as passive recipients of racist discourses, but as active agents who, in order to make sense of their social world, strive to deal with the often contradictory nature of information received in relation to the racial Other (Rizvi, 1993a; Connolly, 1996). 
 
 Bronfenbrenner's ecological perspective on human development adopted by this study, allows us to position the development of children's racialised thinking within the specific contexts of immediate environments (Microsystem), where children experience and create reality (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). At the same time, however, it helps us to see how the experiences within the child's environments are influenced, if not determined, by the broader social processes and institutions (Exosystem), which in many aspects reflect the ideologies (Macrosystem) of racism within Australian society (Jayasuriya, 1999).
 
 The study argues that young Australian children's racialised construction of difference needs to be addressed, possibly through the development of curricula and programs with an anti-racist rather than multicultural focus. Such curricula have a potential to provide children with opportunities to look critically at the dangers of racisms and to challenge everyday racist assumptions. Further qualitative research is needed to unearth the complexities of young Australian children's racialised thought.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/338/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unpicking the semes: power, resistance, and the Internet</field><field name="creator">Tay, Elaine Gueh Swan</field><field name="description">The Internet was a catalyst for refiguring the previous models of media relationships. For many, the Internet is a medium that liberates individuals from the centralised and asymmetrical power structures of traditional mass media and other social institutions in particular, the boundaries set by the nation and the state. For other people, the Internet increases the capacity for surveillance and control. This dissertation argues for a fluid conception of the operations of power and resistance on the Internet that takes into account the various discourses which play a part in determining agency and subjectivity.
 
 It examines and balances the narratives of liberation and oppression against each other: for, just as the developments in Internet technology contribute to changes in discourse, so too existing or prior discursive limits and relations of power affect Internet culture and technology.
 
 In the process of analysing the interplay of different discourses on the Internet, this dissertation takes into account transnational and national cultural flows and the insights that conceptual work on globalisation, transnationalism, and cosmopolitanism can provide. The case studies are concerned with change and centre on the use of the Internet to effect this change; they include: the Singaporean Internet, a 'thread' about Asian culture and Australia, the representation of oppression and the formation of Chinese diasporic collectivities, and anti capitalist networks. Through these case studies, the dissertation examines the degree to which the nation-state can regulate and affect the discourses at play on the Internet as well as the agency of participants in countering and maintaining these discourses. This dissertation also analyses activists' use of the Internet to form transnational networks. It discusses the limitations of their work including problems with representation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/339/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of performance indicators on the work of university academics: a study of four Australian universities</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Jeannette</field><field name="description">In 1988, the Australian Federal Government released the document Higher Education: A Policy Statement which was intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the higher education sector. This paved the way for the application of performance indicators (Pls) across higher education, most notably the creation of a link between Pls (called the Composite Index) and the research component of the annual government funding to universities. Although PIS for teaching became popular, funding for the teaching component was not directly attached to PIS and remained largely based on student enrolments.
 
 The purpose of this study is to examine the perceptions of university academics in Australia on the effects of research and teaching as a result of the introduction of funding based on research Pls. The academic literature suggests that Pls can bring about desirable effects but it also warns that their imposition, particularly by the government on universities, may lead to unintended and undesirable effects, such as goal displacement and strategic manipulation, which may be designed to enhance apparent research performance. To guide the investigation, it was hypothesised that the government's Pls which focus on research will be integrated into the universities' internal policies; will encourage universities to place a high priority on the research activities funded by the Pls; will lead to significantly more paperwork; will contribute to a significant change in the approach to research but not to teaching; and will result in academics adopting negative attitudes towards Pls.
 
 Two basic sources of information were obtained to evaluate these hypotheses. First, the administrations of selected universities were consulted, and staff interviewed, to gauge the degree of change that had been implemented by the universities. Second, a questionnaire was constructed in order to assess academics' attitude towards Pls, and their perceptions of an association between Pls and their institutional reward system. The questionnaire also assessed changes in research, teaching and paperwork activities.
 
 The universities selected characterised the different kinds of universities found in the Unified National System of the Australian higher education system. One hundred and fifty-two academics from these universities were surveyed by the questionnaire. Thirty percent of these academics participated in a structured interview. The disciplines from which the academics were selected for participation included arts/humanities, science, and professional studies which included a natural science based profession and a social science based profession. In addition, a case study of one of these universities was carried out.
 
 The institutions were found to have reorganised their internal policies to incorporate and focus on the Pls in the government's Composite Index. The academics surveyed were generally found to have negative attitude towards their institutional Pls, although staff of higher rank had relatively more positive views. Reasons for their dissatisfaction included the inability of Pls to capture the various dimensions of academic work and privileging research over teaching. For a majority of the academics, the introduction of Pls was associated with a rise in paperwork load and a change in the approach to research in terms of focusing on publications and external research grant applications, particularly those counted in their institutional PI-based funding schemes. The time devoted to these activities, as well as the number of publications and grants for which they were expected to apply, have significantly increased. It was found that staff did use various strategies to maximise their PI scores, such as writing shorter papers in order to increase the quantity of publications. The proportion who changed their approach to teaching was also sizeable; most of them were concerned about getting students through their courses with minimum fuss by having lower ambitions for students and pandering to their superficial needs. However, the proportion who changed their teaching was significantly less than those who changed their research. One possible reason could be the lack of special incentives to increase their emphasis on teaching.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/340/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intergenerational tension in the workplace: a multi-disciplinary and factor analytic approach to the development of an instrument to measure generational differences in organisations</field><field name="creator">Teh, Eng Choo Elaine</field><field name="description">An ageing population is changing the nature of the workplace, one outcome of which is an increase in the proportion of older workers. Unlike older workers of some twenty or so years ago, today's older workers plan to stay at work longer than at first anticipated. However, as many older workers have found, their intended and continued presence in the workplace is not always appreciated. As such, they are subject to subtle and not so subtle forms of discrimination associated with ageist practices, or ageism, and negative perceptions regarding their ability to compete on equal terms with younger workers. In turn, it is suggested that older workers, too, indulge in ageist practices and the stereotyping of younger workers. It is proposed that underlying generational differences,when combined with ageism, negative stereotyping and discriminatory organisational practices, are responsible for a new phenomenon called intergenerational tension in the workplace.
 
 The notion of tension, which can be thought of as suppressed anxiety or a strained relationship between individuals and groups, is important because intergenerational tension is presented as a latent or covert phenomenon. From this comes the following definition: lntergenerational tension in the workplace is a latent or covert form of intergroup conflict caused by value and attitudinal differences between the generations. lntergenerational tension can be thought of as an everyday fact of organisational life which exists as an undercurrent or type of background organisational noise that is so pervasive that it is rarely noticed. In this respect, intergenerational tension bears similarities to gender and ethnic tensions both of which have been recognised as counterproductive to organisational efficiency.
 
 This thesis proposes a construct to measure this intergenerational tension. To investigate the generational differences associated with this new construct, a 25-item questionnaire was developed. The first stage in the development of the questionnaire was an informal experience survey that was completed by a small sample (n=54) of adults ranging in age from 21 years to 70+ years. A pilot study questionnaire was then constructed and administered to a small, stratified random sample of employees (n=60) from the Western Australia Police Service (WAPS). WAPS has recently changed from a seniority-based promotion system to a merit-based system for most positions and is undergoing a major cultural change in response to social and political pressure. Following data analysis, the final questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire, called the Intergenerational Tension Questionnaire (ITQ) was administered to a stratified random sample of employees from WAPS. Five hundred completed responses were subject to factor analysis in which principal components analysis extracted seven factors or dimensions thought to underlie intergenerational tension. Further data analysis revealed that on average, younger workers (i.e., less than 40 years of age) displayed less intergenerational tension than did older workers (i.e., more than 40 years of age). Data for workers a generation apart (i.e., 20 years apart) were also analysed, with the younger generation being those less than 30 years of age (the Under 30s) and the older generation being those more than 50 years of age (the Over 50s). The younger generation, on average, displayed less intergenerational tension than did the older generation.
 
 Of the measures, organisational change was associated with the greatest degree of intergenerational tension for all groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the best predictors of intergenerational tension for younger workers and older workers were age, the length of service with one's current employer, and the number of years in the paid work force. For workers a generation apart, multiple regression analysis revealed that age was the only predictor. It was fortuitous that at the time of the study, the majority of younger workers were Generation X and the majority of older workers were Baby Boomers. This meant that to all intents and purposes, the questionnaire measured differences between two well-studied generational cohorts.
 
 The findings supported the notion that organisations should not assume they are treating all workers equitably. In particular, older workers feel disenfranchised and angry at their treatment by organisations which, in their opinion, favours younger workers. The implication for organisations is that both groups should be treated independently, with each having its own special needs and expectations. This includes, for example, implementing strategies such as training methods suited to the needs of each age group and conducting age diversity training to raise awareness of what it means to be either a younger worker or an older worker.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multidimensional developmental neuropsychological model of borderline personality disorder (BPD): examining evidence for impairments in 'executive function'</field><field name="creator">Theunissen, Christopher</field><field name="description">Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a serious psychiatric disorder characterised by turbulent interpersonal relationships, impaired self image, impulsivity, and a recurrent pattern of unstable affect which is usually evident by early adulthood. It has a community prevalence rate of two per cent, and approximately nine per cent of people diagnosed with BPD commit suicide. This suggests that BPD has one of the highest lethality rates of all psychiatric disorders. The course of the disorder shows a steady improvement over the course of early adulthood with the majority of cases remitting by middle age. This positive but incomplete long-term recovery is thought to be a naturalistic outcome that is independent of treatment effect.
 
 The reported study sought to test selected components of a multidimensional developmental neuropsychological model of executive functioning in BPD. The model proposed that BPD is characterised by impairments to four neuropsychological executive functions. These include working memory, response inhibition, affective-attentional bias, and problem-solving. The model further proposed that impaired executive functioning in BPD occurs as a result of the failure of 'experience-dependent' maturation of orbitofrontal structures. These structures are closely associated with the development of the 'cognitive executive'. 
 
 The study incorporated a cross-sectional design to analyse data from a BPD group, a Depressed Control Group, and a Medical Control Group. The overall findings of the study returned limited support for the original hypotheses. There was no evidence of deficits in working memory, response-inhibition, or problem-solving. In contrast, the BPD group returned some evidence of deficits in affective-attentional bias. 
 
 Therefore, the results suggest that executive functioning remains largely intact in BPD. This also suggests that people with BPD have the working memory resources necessary to facilitate abstract cognition, have the capacity to effectively plan and execute future-oriented acts, and are able to perform appropriate problem-solving functions. These problem-solving returns are also particularly significant because a number of the tasks utilised in the study are known to be associated with so-called 'frontal-executive' function. These unremarkable findings challenge the view that people with BPD might experience some form of subtle neurological impairment associated with frontal-lobe compromise. 
 
 The Stroop measure of affective-attentional bias provided the only supportive evidence for the proposed model, and these findings can be accounted for by at least two different explanations. The first suggests that BPD might be characterised by a hypervigilant attentional set. The specific cause of hypervigilance in BPD is unknown, but some candidate factors appear to be the often-reported abuse histories of borderlines, insecure attachment histories, and deficits in parental bonding. The second interpretation suggests that the Stroop findings reflect a form of 'response conflict' in which BPD participants experience difficulties overriding tasks that rely on the enunciation of automatic neural routines. As a result of these findings, further research on the role of arousal, priming, hypervigilance, and response-conflict in BPD is required. It is likely that the Stroop findings reflect a basic, 'hard-wired' attentional mechanism that consolidates by early adolescence at the latest. As a result, the Stroop findings have implications for both the prevention and treatment of BPD. 
 
 A number of prevention strategies could be developed to address the attentional issues identified in the present study. These include assisting children to more effectively regulate arousal and affect, and assisting parents to communicate affectively with children in order to enhance self-regulation. The treatment implications suggest that interventions directed at affective-attentional processes are required, and further suggest the need for new pharmacotherapies and psychological treatments to modify dysfunctional attentional process. Affective neuroscience will have an increasingly important role to play in the understanding of BPD, and the next quarter century is likely to witness exciting advances in understanding this most problematic of disorders.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/342/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxygen management for optimisation of nitrogen removal in a sequencing batch reactor</field><field name="creator">Third, Katie</field><field name="description">In today's progressively urbanised society, there is an increasing need for cost-effective, environmentally sound technologies for the removal of nutrients (carbon, phosphorous, nitrogen) from polluted water. Nitrogen removal from wastewater is the focus of this thesis. 
 
 Conventional nitrogen removal requires the two processes of aerobic nitrification followed by anoxic denitrification, which is driven by remaining reducing power. While most wastewaters contain a significant fraction of reducing power in the form of organic substrate, it is difficult to preserve the reducing power required for denitrification, due to the necessary preceding aerobic oxidation step. Consequently, one of the major limitations to complete N-removal in traditional wastewater treatment systems is the shortage of organic carbon substrate for the reduction of oxidised nitrogen (NO^2-, NO^3-), produced from nitrification. 
 
 This thesis followed two main research themes that aimed to address the problem of organic carbon limitation in nitrogen removal from wastewater, by management of the oxygen supply. The first theme was the study of N-removal by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) in the novel reactor type, the sequencing batch reactor (SBR). It was aimed to increase understanding of PHB metabolism and the limiting factors of SND and then to develop a suitable on-line control strategy to manage the oxygen supply and optimise nitrogen removal by SND. The second main research theme was the application of the CANON(Completely Autotrophic Nitrogen-removal Over Nitrite) process for nitrogen removal from wastewater; a novel process that requires minimal oxygen supply and has the potential to completely circumvent the requirement for organic substrate in nitrogen removal because it is catalysed by autotrophic microorganisms - Anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidisers) and aerobic nitrifiers. 
 
 For study of the SND process, a completely automated 2 L sequencing batch reactor was developed with on-line monitoring of the dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and oxidation-reduction (ORP) potential. The SBR was operated continuously for up to 2 years and, due to its separation of different phases by time, enabled the study and optimisation of different microbial activities, including acetate uptake and conversion to PHB (feast phase), PHB hydrolysis and consumption (famine phase), nitrification and denitrification (and SND). All experimental work was performed using a mixed culture and acetate as the organic substrate. Acetate consumption and PHB production was studied under different oxygen supply rates to establish conditions that allow maximum conversion of acetate to PHB during the feast phase. Lower DO supply rates (kLa 6 - 16 h^-1) resulted in preservation of a higher proportion of acetate as PHB than at higher DO supply rates (kLa 30 and 51 h^-1). Up to 77 % of the reducing equivalents available from acetate were converted to PHB under O2-limitation, as opposed to only 54 % under O2-excess conditions, where a higher fraction of acetate was used for biomass growth. A metabolic model based on biochemical stoichiometry was developed that could reproduce the trends of the effect of oxygen on PHB production. Experimental findings and simulated results highlighted the importance of oxygen control during the feast phase of an SBR in preserving reducing power as PHB. 
 
 To develop an oxygen management strategy for the aerobic famine phase,the effect of the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on SND, using PHB as the electron donor, was investigated. There was a clear compromise between the rate and the percentage of SND achieved at different DO concentrations. A DO setpoint of 1 mg L^-1 was optimal for both the percentage of SND (61 %) and rate of SND (4.4 mmol N. Cmol X-1. h^-1). Electron flux analysis showed that most SND activity occurred during the first hour of the aerobic famine period, when the oxygen uptake rate (due to NH4 + and PHB oxidation) was highest. Aerated denitrification ceased as soon as NH4 + was depleted.
 
 The presence of NH4 + provided an oxygen 'shield', preventing excessive penetration of oxygen into the flocs and creating larger anoxic zones for SND. PHB degradation was first order with respect to the biomass PHB concentration (dfPHB/dt = 0.19 . fPHB). The slow nature of PHB degradation made it a suitable substrate for SND, as it was degraded at a similar rate to ammonium oxidation. While DO control during the aerobic famine phase could increase nitrogen removal via SND, total N-removal in the SBR was still limited by the availability of reducing power(PHB) in the anoxic phase. The length of the aerobic phase needed to be minimised to prevent over-oxidation of PHB after NH4 + depletion. The specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) was found to be an effective on-line parameter that could reproducibly detect the end-point of nitrification. A simple method was developed for continuous, on-line measurement of the SOUR, which was used for automated adjustment of the aerobic phase length. Minimisation of the aerobic phase length by feedback control of the SOUR improved nitrogen removal from 69 % (without phase length control) to 86 %, during one cycle. The SOUR-aeration control technique could successfully adapt the aerobic phase length to varying wastewater types and strengths and to varying aeration conditions. The medium- and long-term effects of oxygen management on nitrogen removal was investigated by operating the SBR continuously for up to one month using DO control throughout all stages of the SBR, i.e. oxygen-limitation during the feast phase, a DO setpoint of 1 mg L-1 during the famine phase and SOUR controlled aerobic phase length. Complete oxygen management resulted in minimisation of the amount of PHB that was oxidised aerobically in each SBR cycle and caused an accumulation of cellular PHB over time. The increased availability of PHB during aeration resulted in a higher SOUR and increased N-removal by SND from 34 to 54 %. After one month of continuous SBR operation, the settling efficiency of the biomass improved from 110 mL . g-1X to less than 70 mL . g-1X and almost complete N-removal (9 %) was achieved via SND during aeration, however at a reduced rate (1.5 mmol Cmol X^-1 h^-1). Therefore, long-term oxygen management resulted in biomass with improved settling characteristics and a higher capacity for SND. Results of the first main research theme highlighted the importance of aeration control throughout all stages of the SBR for maximum N-removal via SND.
 
 The CANON process was investigated as an alternative to the use of conventional activated sludge for treatment of wastewaters limited by organic carbon substrate. The initial study of the CANON process was performed at the Kluyver Laboratory in Delft, the Netherlands, using an already established Anammox enrichment culture. The effect of extended periods of NH4 +-limitation on the CANON microbial populations was studied, to examine their ability to recover from major disturbances in feed composition. The CANON process was stable for long periods of time until the N-loading rate reached below 0.1 kg N m 3 day-1, when a third population of bacteria developed in the system (aerobic nitrite oxidisers), resulting in a decrease in N-removal from 92 % to 57 %. Nitrite oxidisers developed due to increased levels of oxygen and nitrite. 
 
 This highlighted the requirement for oxygen control during the CANON process to prevent increased DO levels and growth of undesired microbes. To initiate the CANON process from a local source, Anammox was enriched from local activated sludge (Perth, Western Australia). FISH analysis (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) of the enriched Anammox strain showed that it belonged to the Order Planctomycetales, the same as all other identified Anammox strains, but represented a new species of Anammox. The enrichment culture was not inhibited by repeated exposure to oxygen, allowing initiation of an intermittently-aerated CANON process to achieve sustained, completely autotrophic ammonium removal (0.08 kg N m-3 day-1) for an extended period of time, without any addition of organic carbon substrate. Dissolved oxygen control played a critical role in achieving alternating aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidation.
 
 The main conclusion drawn from the study is the important role of oxygen management in achieving improved nitrogen removal. A careful oxygen management strategy can minimise wastage of reducing power to improve PHB-driven SND by activated sludge and can prevent major disturbances to the population balance in the CANON system. Oxygen management has the potential to reduce aeration costs while significantly improving nitrogen removal from wastewaters limited by organic carbon.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/343/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extraordinary undercurrents: Australian cinema, genre and the everyday</field><field name="creator">Thomas, David Glyndwr</field><field name="description">'Extraordinary Undercurrents: Australian Cinema, Genre and the Everyday' investigates how the critical uptake of genre-based cinema has been incorporated into the cultural and industrial rubric of Australian national cinema. The thesis offers, in part, a revaluation of theoretically under-emphasized texts (as well as texts that have been the subject of much higher levels of scrutiny), in order to establish recurrent threads within Australian cinema. In doing this, the thesis offers new and original knowledge in the form of developing a perspective for a revised critical and theoretical analysis of genre cinema within Australian cinema, challenging the presumption of the kinds of texts that can be seen as articulating the nation. The groups of films examined herein form nodes through which a network of important and divergent ideas about nation, national identity and social organization come together in the form of narrative and thematic undercurrents.
 
 These (generally malevolent) undercurrents are articulated in the filmic representation of a range of conventional personal, social and cultural dichotomies, and of particular interest are the events, characters and narratives in which the everyday is confronted by the abstract, abject and uncanny. The undercurrents I identify are shown as the textual sites in which transgression - both inside and outside the frame - and intertextuality are collocated, representing the convergence of material which simultaneously operates outside of genres, while reinforcing textual similarity.

Suits, shoulder pads and power dressing are images and phrases that encircle working women and are too often relegated to the empty cubicles of 1980s and 1990s history. The proliferation of internet-mediated commerce meant - in fictional narratives at least - women swapped their Claiborne for geek chic and 'up all night' hair, the preferential wear for New Economy employees.1 In the 2000s, the Australian employment industry - fractured, non-standard and fluid - is promoting a new 'creative' work order. What are the consequences of this transformation of ideology and iconography for workplace dressing and the bodies of the women who wear it?
 
 This doctoral thesis examines the relationship between fashion, clothes, women and work. The goal and methodology of this thesis is the alignment of work theory, with discourses of clothing and fashion, oral history, policy documents and popular culture. Such a research project requires interdisciplinary scholarship that activates debates about women's bodies, the state of the contemporary working environment and the dissonance in literacies between body and workplace. Through the application of semiotic and cultural studies, as well as drawing on theories of media, gender, labour, leisure, literacy and fashion, I investigate the position of women and their bodies within the contemporary Australian workplace.
 
 This thesis deploys oral histories to illuminate how women function in the changing Australian workplace. I have compiled these oral sources in order to capture specific experiences and portray the successes and struggles that are faced by the women employed in these sectors. The function of these histories in this thesis is to provide a memory of, to and for working women, revealing many of the unspoken assumptions and characteristics of the contemporary Australian workforce, such as the New Economy, an increasing non-standard workforce, the myth of 'work/life balance', lifestyle, dissonant bodies in the workplace, and the compartmentalization of work from other social function including family life.
 
 Within the nine chapters of this thesis, the research objective is to explore how women's bodies are located within and negotiate the contemporary Australian workforce. It begins with an examination of the conflation between 'self-help' and feminist texts, to map the troubled relationship between gender, power and the female body. The disparate functions of dress and bodies are important focuses in this research. The use of oral history, popular memory theory and the textual analysis of magazines is a way to interrogate the role of women's bodies and fashion in history. The use of oral and popular cultural sources is intentional. The goal is to develop an alternative system for remembering bodies and clothing, with the aim of transforming their historical relevance. The focal point of this thesis is assessing women's bodies and fashion in the workplace. By evaluating contemporary trends in women's work attire, I expose the disparity in the work clothes market in relation to quality, accessibility, functionality and price.
 
 This doctoral thesis deploys work theory and the ideologies of the 'New' and 'Old' Economy. Throughout this project, I trace the differences in workplace customs and representations. The purpose of the thesis - and indeed the original contribution to knowledge - is to demonstrate that women and men must be literate in not only the workplace, but also in workplace clothing. Only when moving from everyday to reflexive literacies can relevant models of discrimination and oppression within the 'New Economy' be revealed and addressed.
 
 While presenting the voices and views of working women, this research proposes a strategy for a change in education and the requirement of mentoring in relation to careers and the 'new' work order. The latter chapters are focussed on tracing working life in the new knowledge economy within Australia. They explore the notion of 'supplementary' work in relation to 'lifestyle' change and investigates the creative industries, the creative class and ponders the dilemma of the creative industries in Australia. The objective of this thesis is to not only to critique, but also to gather and deploy the words of women in the contemporary workplace, as both inspiration and model for the strategies required to instigate change. The final chapters capture a proactive desire to not only discuss difference, but make a difference. The probing of dissonant literacies in the workplace opens the tight and troubling relationship between women and bodies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/345/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trawling deeper seas: the gendered production of seafood in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Stella, Leonie C.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the sexual division of labour in three worksites associated with the Western Australian Fishing industry: fishers' households, a seafood processing company and fishing vessels. There has been no previous substantial study of the labour of women in Australian fishing industries. 
 
 My research has been primarily undertaken by interviewing women and men who work in the Western Australian fishing industry, and my findings are presented through a comparison with overseas literature relative to each site. 
 
 As I found, in the households of fishermen, women do unpaid and undervalued labour which includes servicing men and children; managing household finances and operating fishing enterprises. In seafood processing companies women are allocated the lowest paid and least rewarding work which is regarded as women's work. On-the factory floor issues of class, race/ ethnicity and gender intersect so that the majority of women employed in hands-on processing work are migrant women from a non-English speaking background. The majority of women who work at sea are cook/ deckhands who are confronted by a rigid sexual division of labour, and work in a hyper-masculine workplace.
 
 The few other women who have found a niche which enables them to enjoy an outdoor lifestyle while they earn their own living, are those who work as autonomous independent small boat fishers. In each site there is evidence that women, individually and collectively, exercise some power in determining how and where they work, but they remain marginalised from the more lucrative sites of the industry, and have limited access to economic and social power.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/346/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The seafarers and maritime entrepreneurs of Madura: history, culture, and their role in the Java Sea timber trade</field><field name="creator">Stenross, Kurt</field><field name="description">The seafaring people of Madura, situated off the northeastern coast of Java, are one of the leading maritime groups in the Indonesian archipelago. They have played a major role in indigenous shipping, and since the second half of the nineteenth century their importance in this field has been second only to that of the Bugis and Makassarese. With their strong maritime orientation and outward economy, the coastal Madurese contrast strongly with the agricultural orientation of their near neighbours, the Javanese and the Balinese.
 
 The first part of this thesis presents the Madurese in historical context vis-his the Javanese and the maritime groups of Sulawesi. It then considers the various historical and cultural-ecological factors which predisposed the coastal Madurese toward seafaring as a livelihood, and which enabled them to eclipse their former rivals along the north coast of Java. The main seafaring centres of Madura during the twentieth century are identified, with these being in three distinct locations: the northwest coast, the southwest coast, and the eastern islands of Madura. Special attention is paid to the two major commodities carried by traditional Madurese vessels, salt and cattle, leading up to a more detailed consideration of the major transport commodity from the 1960s until the present, timber.
 
 The second part of thesis focuses on the role of the Madurese in the Java Sea timber trade. A key aspect of this account is the struggle between timber importers and the state. The legal aspects of the movement of timber are explained, along with their economic significance for importers and vessel operators, and the changing degree of compliance with the law from the early 1970s to the much stricter enforcement after the mid-1990s. From the late 1990s until 2003 the focus becomes closer to reveal the inner workings of the timber trade, with special attention paid to the rise of 'wild' ports on the isolated north coast of Madura, as well as the difficulties faced by many Madurese vessel operators after the ethnic conflict in Central Kalimantan in 2001. The profitability and risks of the perahu operators and timber traders are explained, and career profiles of several prominent individuals are presented.
 
 The study ranges widely in its setting, including maritime villages around Madura, perahu ports in Java, and timber ports in Kalimantan. It concludes that the traditional approach to business of the Madurese is no longer appropriate, and that diversification and change of approach are now necessary. The maritime entrepreneurs of East Madura have in this respect been more successful than their counterparts in West Madura, and it is suggested that this difference is linked to historical differences between the two areas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/347/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into aspects of the replication of Jembrana disease virus</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Meredith</field><field name="description">Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is an acutely pathogenic lentivirus affecting Bali cattle in Indonesia. The inability to propagate the virus in vitro has made it difficult to quantitate JDV and determine the kinetics of virus replication during the acute disease process. Reported for the first time are 2 techniques that enable quantification of the virus, and the use of these techniques to quantify the virus load in plasma of cattle during the acute disease process. The 2 techniques were a qualitative one-step JDV real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay for the detection and quantification of JDV RNA, and a JDV p26 capture ELISA for the detection and quantification of JDV capsid protein. The limit of detection of the qRT-PCR was 9.8 x 102 JDV viral RNA copies over 35 cycles, equivalent to 4.2 x 104 JDV genome copies/ml, and a peak virus load of 1.6 x 1012 JDV genome copies /ml during the acute febrile period. Viral RNA and JDV p26 levels were correlated in 48 plasma samples obtained from experimentally infected cattle. A significant positive correlation (R = 0.835 and r2 = 0.697) was observed between the 2 techniques within the range of their detection limits, providing a solid basis for the use of the economical capture ELISA to quantify JDV load when real-time PCR capability is not available. The detection of JDV p26 by capture ELISA was, however, much less sensitive than the real-time RTPCR with a detection limit equating to approximately 1 x 108 JDV genome copies/ml. The transcriptional pattern of JDV during the acute phase of infection was studied by RT-PCR, sequencing and northern blot analysis. Analysis revealed a complex pattern of transcription with the identification of 14 transcripts, which confirmed 6 predicted splice sites and the identified 7 splice sites not reported previously. A small 78 bp putative non-coding exon was identified that shared the same splice acceptor as vif and was associated with the alternative transcripts of tat, rev and env. Four tat, 3 rev and 2 env transcripts were identified. The rev and env transcripts were demonstrated to use the same splice site. The study confirmed that the production of a tmx transcript, a unique gene identified in the two bovine lentiviruses JDV and Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). Northern blot analysis identified 11 of the 14 transcripts identified by RT-PCR, including a 7.8 kb gag/pol primary transcript and singly spliced transcripts. The complexity of the transcript map produced suggested that JDV replication is a highly regulated process.
 
 One of the aims of this thesis was to determine the functional role of the Tmx and Vif accessory proteins of the bovine lentiviruses. Although this aim was not achieved, molecular reagents were produced that will allow these investigations to proceed. The Vif and Tmx proteins of both JDV and BIV were successfully expressed as C-terminal fusions with glutathione S-transferase (GST) using the pGEX-6P-1 bacterial expression system. The recombinant proteins were purified and were recognised by both BIV and JDV antisera from Bos taurus and Bos javanicus respectively, and by antibody in sera from cattle that had been vaccinated with a tissue-derived JDV vaccine and also those that had been naturally infected with JDV. The Vif, Tmx and Rev proteins of JDV and vif BIV were successfully expressed in a Rev-independent manner in COS7 and bovine macrophage cells using a pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression system. Cellular localisation of the recombinant viral proteins varied in the 2 cell types: in COS7 cells, both JDV and BIV Vif were detected predominantly in the nucleus, whereas in bovine macrophage cells BIV Vif localised in the cytoplasm and JDV Vif localised in the cytoplasm and nuclear membrane. JDV Tmx localised in the cytoplasm of COS7 cells but the nuclear membrane of bovine macrophage cells, and BIV Tmx localised in the nucleus and nuclear membrane in both cell types and appeared to affect the morphology of the nucleus. Mutations of vif and tmx were also successfully engineered into an infectious clone of BIV and these mutated clones will provide a valuable resource for further investigation of the role of Vif and Tmx in replication of the bovine lentiviruses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/348/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender gymnastics: performers, fans and gender issues in the Takarazuka Revue of contemporary Japan</field><field name="creator">Stickland, Leonie Rae</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female musical theatre company, seeking to investigate its relation to broader issues of gender in contemporary Japan. Takarazuka has simultaneously reinforced and challenged the gender norms of Japanese society for the past ninety years, and indeed provides insights into the construction of those very norms. Takarazuka takes images of masculinity and femininity from mainstream society, the media, arts and popular culture, in both Japan and other countries, and reconstructs them according to its own distinct notions of how gender should be portrayed, both on and off its stage, not only by its performers, but also by fans and creative staff.  Unlike in other single-sex theatrical genres featuring cross-dressing, such as Kabuki, gender is the essential focus of every performance in Takarazuka.  Takarazuka's practices show that gender is not inherent, but must be learned through observation, imitation and direct instruction, and that various versions of male gender can be assumed for specific purposes, even temporarily, by biological females (and vice versa). Takarazuka's relationship with gender extends well beyond the stage itself; and one of the ways in which this thesis goes beyond other studies is its focus on the whole life-course of Takarazuka performers, including their girlhood and post-retirement years. 
 
 The relationship with gender issues encompasses fans as well.  The popularity of Takarazuka's male-role players (otokoyaku), in particular, indicates that the manipulation of gender within a theatrical context has great appeal for audiences. However, many Takarazuka fans, especially female fans of the otokoyaku, evidently not only passively consume the artistry of gender impersonation on its stage, but also actively contribute to its production by communicating their expectations about gender performance to the actors and the Takarazuka administration, and by encouraging each performer to sustain her stage gender off-stage when she appears in public, at least to a certain extent. The emotional investment of fans in supporting Takarazuka is often intense and long-lasting, and their attraction to Takarazuka clearly is not necessarily based solely upon sexuality, as other studies have proposed, but involves broader issues of gender.
 
 The influence of Takarazuka derives not only from its performances, but also from many other aspects of its organisation and gender-linked practices.  Takarazuka's existence and details about its members and various unique practices are widely publicised by the media.  Its influence upon the social construction of gender in Japan extends beyond the confines of its theatres, its versions of gender roles affecting the lives of many in the general populace apart from those directly involved in performing in, creating or supporting its productions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/349/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specialist teachers and curriculum reform in a Western Australian primary school in 2002: a comparative study of specialist music, health and physical education, and languages-other-than-English teaching professionals</field><field name="creator">Stone, Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis details research on the first phase of curriculum reform (1999-2004) in a government primary school in Western Australia. The purpose of the study was to examine what progress had been made with the implementation of the Curriculum Framework (1998). The research focussed on Music, Health and Physical Education, and Languages Other than English as specialist teachers working with the Curriculum Framework (1998). Teachers and school administrators, as frontline practitioners, considered their experiences and perceptions of daily practice and provided their perspectives on curriculum reform.
 
 The hypothesis formulated for the study was that with the introduction of the Curriculum Framework (1998) the delivery of these three subjects could be further improved. This study argues that successful curriculum performance of these three subjects traditionally considered 'specialist programs' may be more fully supported by becoming aware of the forces influencing Australian curriculum discourse and delivery. Subject knowledge endorsement in this study refers to the transfer of valued knowledge in Western Australian educational systems. It is proposed that if teaching professionals articulated the substance of their educational beliefs and experiences with regard to subject knowledge meaning, place and value, curriculum delivery in primary schools may progress more effectively. Positive learning experiences for all students can be provided through the encouragement of communication and collegiality together with relevant and accessible professional development. These measures can also be supported by mounting whole-school primary programs that engage with beliefs about Music, Health and Physical Education, and Languages Other Than English through collaborative networks and learning communities. Accordingly, curriculum delivery can come within reach of the seamless curriculum anticipated by reform (Curriculum Framework, 1998:6-7).
 
 In this qualitative interview study, the frontline participants included generalist teachers, specialist teachers and school administrators. These educational practitioners were asked to participate in an in-depth, semi-structured discussion that explored their perceptions of specialist teaching and knowledge while employed at Deep Sea Primary School in 2002. They teachers also commented on how these perceptions may be linked to their experiences of socially constructed and established notions of valued knowledge.
 
 The findings of this study indicated that the progressive implementation of these three subjects or specialist's areas were characterised by subtle historical, economic, political and social forces. This thesis suggests that, these largely obscured external forces together with individual yet, taken for granted perceptions of what is perceived as valuable knowledge work together to position curriculum rhetoric and curriculum enactment that reflect established perceptions of the knowledge hierarchy. Teachers and administrators at the school often operated within the structures and meanings of conventional teaching practice of subject knowledge as determined by dominant culture in Australia. The findings indicated that school culture in a time of reform re-traditionalised hierarchical patterns of subject knowledge organisation and evaluation. Accordingly, current subject knowledge endorsement in terms of specialist teaching often worked to the benefit of established power relationships typical of post-industrial market economy in Australia.
 
 The findings also indicated that issues pertaining to curriculum prioritisation were influenced by institutional, group and individual experiences of subject specialist knowledge. Poor perceptions of these three subjects could also be generated by experiencing inflexible and inadequate yet established funding and resource patterns in educational systems. Frontline teachers, their school-based roles and responsibilities attached to the teaching and learning of the three specialist areas were typified by rigid school organisation and job structures together with condensed teaching time and community backing.
 
 This thesis argues that progressive, outcomes education requires an articulate and supportive school culture, more funding and the genuine maintenance of quality Music, Health and Physical Education and Language Other Than English teachers. In addition, curriculum implementation would benefit from the promotion of constructivist-orientated student activities within specialist programs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/350/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Floral biology and propagation of blue-flowered Conospermum spp</field><field name="creator">Stone, Lynley M.</field><field name="description">Blue-flowered Conospermum are endemic to Western Australia, and show great potential as cut flowers.  Propagation from cuttings or seed proved difficult, and root initiation in vitro is problematic.  This thesis examines the floral biology of the species and the possibility of using somatic embryogenesis to overcome propagation problems.  
 
 A survey of explant tissue types for C. eatoniae and C. caeruleum was carried out to identify tissue that could be induced into embryogenic pathways.  Vegetative, semi-floral and floral buds were initiated into culture from February to June, but were found unsuitable for embryogenesis, producing shoots, callus or dying in culture.  Leaves from in vitro leaf cultures formed callus in the presence of 2,4-D and BAP, but were unable to differentiate into embryos in the presence of a variety of growth regulator combinations and concentrations.  Immature zygotes died in culture.  Direct embryogenesis and/or embryogenic callus was observed on mature zygotes of the species C. caeruleum, C. spectabile, C. dorrienii and C. brownii, and somatic embryos were maintained in culture for up to 18 months for C. caeruleum.  
 
 Maturation and germination of somatic embryos proved difficult; treatments of cold, ABA, desiccation or mannitol did not induce maturation.  It appears that developmental pathways in Conospermum are well defined and are difficult to alter in vitro.  It was concluded that somatic embryogenesis has limited commercial potential in these species.
 
 Conospermum species have an active pollination mechanism where the style is held in a state of tension when the flower opens.  When pressure is applied at the base of the style by an insect, the style flicks downwards, striking the insect pollinator and releasing pollen from the anther in a single dusty mass.  However, the breeding systems of blue-flowered Conospermum have not previously been well explored.
 
 Flowers on a C. eatoniae inflorescence opened from the basal end upwards acropetally, with the terminal two or three buds never opening.  Fruit and seed set occurred only from the basal one to three buds.  Isolation of C. eatoniae and C. amoenum flowers showed they were unable to self-pollinate in the absence of insect pollinators.  
 
 Experiments to determine the timing of the peak of stigmatic receptiveness were inconclusive.  Pollen germinated and penetrated the stigma 0 - 6 days after anther dehiscence.  Pollen loads on the stigma did not relate to the number of pollen tubes observed down the style.  Controlled pollinations of cultivated C. eatoniae at a field station using self and cross pollen, revealed compatibility with a range of pollen genotypes, as pollen tubes were observed extending down the style.  However, late-acting incompatibility could not be ruled out as controlled crosses failed to set any seed as flowers were shed from the bush.  
 
 DNA analysis of open pollinated C. eatoniae seed progeny from two plants from a field station and two plants in natural bushland revealed very different pollination habits.  Plants from the field station showed no outcrossing, with progeny closely resembling the maternal parent, whereas plants from the wild population showed outcrossing with several different paternal parents.  These results suggest self-pollinated seed can be reliably obtained in a plantation situation using stands of ramets of the same clone. Alternatively, assuming that the required insect pollinators are present in a cultivated stand, it should be possible to obtain cross pollinated seed by surrounding the maternal plant with the desired paternal parent.
 
 Unusual pollen behaviour was observed for many blue-flowered species, a white-flowered species of Conospermum, and close relative, Synaphea petiolaris.  Up to three pollen tubes emerged from the triporate pollen in vitro, and at rates of up to 55 mcgms-1.  This rate was maintained for only 2 s but is greater than 20 times faster than reported in the literature for any species, in vitro or in vivo.  Pollen with multiple tubes was also observed on the stigma in vivo in C. amoenum flowers.
 
 Changing the osmotic pressure of the germination medium by altering sucrose concentration influenced the number of tubes to emerge from the pollen grain; generally the number of tubes decreased as sucrose increased.  However, the rate of tube growth was unaffected.  The addition of calcium channel blockers to the germination medium had no effect on Conospermum growth rate, nor did they eliminate pulses of tube growth.
 
 Observation of Conospermum pollen ultrastructure revealed similarities to Gramineae pollen.  The tube cytoplasm was packed with vesicles filled with material of similar electron density to the cell wall.  Few golgi were identified, and the apical end of the tube contained these vesicles, smaller secretory vesicles and mitochondria.  This is atypical of the tip, which is normally free of large vesicles.  Distinct zones in the cytoplasm were not identified, which is similar to Gramineae.  Like the grasses, Conospermum appears to pre-manufacture cell wall material and store it in vesicles ready for rapid germination and extension.
 
 A biological function of multiple pollen tube emergence with such rapid growth was not elucidated.
 
 This research has shown Conospermum to be a complex and very interesting genus. Further investigation into the remarkable growth of multiple pollen tubes would enhance our knowledge of the biological processes involved in tube growth and the process of fast wall formation. The potential benefits to the cut flower industry of commercialising some of these species warrants further effort to find an efficient method of propagation. Introduction into horticulture may be the only means by which these threatened species will survive.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/351/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and leadership in computer-mediated collaborative groups</field><field name="creator">Sudweeks, Fay</field><field name="description">Computer-mediated collaboration is an important feature of modern organisational and educational settings. Despite its ever increasing popularity, it is still commonly compared unfavourably with face-to-face collaboration because non-verbal and paralinguistic cues are minimal. Although research on face-to-face group collaboration is well documented, less is known about computer-mediated collaboration.
 
 The initial focus of this thesis was an in-depth analysis of a case study of a computer-mediated collaborative group. The case study was a large international group of volunteer researchers who collaborated on a two-year research project using asynchronous communication (email). This case study was a window on collaborative dialogue in the early 1990s (1992-94) at a time when information and communication technologies were at an early stage of development. 
 
 After identifying the issues emerging from this early case study, another case study using technologies and virtual environments developed over the past decade, was designed to further understand how groups work together on a collaborative activity. The second case study was a small group of students enrolled in a unit of study at Murdoch University who collaborated on a series of nine online workshops using synchronous communication (chat room). This case study was a window on collaborative dialogue in the year 2000 when information and communication technologies had developed at a rate which few people envisioned in the early 90s.
 
 The primary aim of the research described in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of how computer-mediated collaborative communities develop and grow. In particular, the thesis addresses questions related to the developmental and leadership characteristics of collaborative groups.
 
 Internet research requires a set of assumptions relating to ontology, epistemology, human nature and methodological approach that differs from traditional research assumptions. A research framework for Internet research - Complementary Explorative Data Analysis (CEDA) - was therefore developed and applied to the two case studies. 
 
 The results of the two case studies using the CEDA methodology indicate that computer-mediated collaborative groups are highly adaptive to the aim of the collaborative task to be completed, and the medium in which they collaborate. In the organisational setting, it has been found that virtual teams can devise and complete a collaborative task entirely online. It may be an advantage, but it is certainly not mandatory to have preliminary face-to-face discussions. What is more important is to ensure that time is allowed for an initial period of structuration which involves social interaction to develop a social presence and eventually cohesiveness. In the educational setting, a collaborative community increases pedagogical effectiveness. Providing collaborative projects and interdependent tasks promotes constructivist learning and a strong foundation for understanding how to collaborate in the global workplace. Again, this research has demonstrated that students can collaborate entirely online, although more pedagogical scaffolding may be required than in the organisational setting. The importance of initial social interaction to foster a sense of presence and community in a mediated environment has also been highlighted.
 
 This research also provided greater understanding of emergent leadership in computer-mediated collaborative groups. It was found that sheer volume of words does not make a leader but frequent messages with topic-related content does contribute to leadership qualities.

The common law and statutory rules of interpretation assist in maintaining this distinction, establishing the myth that legal decision-making is a purely objective and rational process, giving rise to internal truths. While critical theorists have illustrated the ways in which the lines between the inside and outside are always blurred, there remains a perceived distinction, in law, between the interpretation of concepts that occurs in the law and that which occurs outside the law. Only the former have legal legitimacy. The idea of the legal family is a case in point, where the law defines family according to its own prescriptions irrespective of how family is constituted by non-legal communities. In this thesis, I consider the meanings of family in different spheres to show how the lines between the social, the political and the legal consistently overlap. I then develop a mechanism by which the law can acknowledge and affirm that which is 'outside'. This requires, firstly, a conception of law as communication and of legal interpretation as a constructive process. Secondly, the task demands that jurists engage with the semiotic processes of the everyday and that legal concepts, at least those that exist independently of the law (family for example) be framed with an open indexicality. This might enable such concepts to be interpreted according to a range of contexts, other than (or in addition to) the legal one. Finally, using the family as an example, I illustrate how a semiotic approach can assist legal interpretation, reform and analysis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/353/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thai cinema as national cinema: an evaluative history</field><field name="creator">Sungsri, Patsorn</field><field name="description">This dissertation considers Thai cinema as a national text. It portrays and analyses Thai film from the introduction of cinema to Thailand during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (1868-1910) up until the present day (2004). 
 
 At its core, this thesis adopts the ideas of Higson, O'Regan and Dissanayake in considering the cultural negotiation of cinema and the construction of nation. In this study of Thai National Cinema two principal methods are employed - economic and text-based. In terms of political economy Thai National Cinema is explored through the historical development of the local film industry, the impact of imported cinema, taxation, censorship and government policy, and the interplay between vertically and horizontally integrated media businesses. Special attention is paid to the evolving and dynamic role of the ruling class in the local film industry. The dissertation's text-based analyses concern the social and ideological contexts of these national productions in order to consider extant characteristics of Thai nationhood and how these are either reflected or problematised in Thai Cinema. 
 
 Of particular relevance is this dissertation's emphasis on three resilient and potent signifiers of Thai identity- nation, religion,and monarchy - and their interrelationship and influence in the development of Thai National Cinema. These three 'pillars' of Thai society form the basis for organising an understanding of the development of Thai cinematic tradition, now over a century old. This thesis argues that any discussion of the historical, or current, development of Thai National Cinema must accommodate the pervasive role that these three principal forms of national identity play in formulating Thai society, culture, and politics. The recent challenges of globalisation and postmodernism, as well as the rise of an educated middle-class, provide opportunity for reconceptualizing the relevance of these three pillars. In this way Thai National Cinema can be considered a useful barometer in both reflecting and promoting the construction of Thai identity and thought.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/354/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpersonal emotional responses in violent offenders: (re)examining the role of empathy</field><field name="creator">Beven, Jaimie Patricia</field><field name="description">The study of empathy has had a long history in both psychology and philosophy; however, debate has continued in relation to the exact nature of the construct. Several distinct variants of empathy have evolved over time, with some researchers viewing the construct as cognitive, while others emphasise the affective nature of empathy. An examination of the history of the construct reveals evidence which supports both positions. Multidimensional models of empathy, such as that posed by Davis (1994), encompass both cognitive and affective accounts of empathy, as well as their interaction. Despite the apparent acceptance of multidimensional models of empathy, confusion still remains as to the definition of empathy. This has restrained theories of the relationship between empathy and constructs such as aggression.
 
 The current program of study sought to clarify the relationship between aggression and empathy, focusing on a multidimensional approach. It was argued that previous research relied on the assumed inhibitory nature of empathy on aggression, and although intuitive, had failed to acknowledge alternative explanations for a relationship between empathy and aggression. Three possible explanations to account for a possible relationship between empathy and aggression were therefore examined. Firstly, that the distress cues of another produce distress in the observer (personal distress) and that distress is interpreted as aversive. Personal distress produces a drive to reduce the aversive state which may result in the use of violence by some individuals. (Empathic arousal functioning as a facilitator of aggression); secondly, that the distress cues of another fail to produce an affective reaction in some observers. (Empathic arousal failing to function as an inhibitor of aggression); and thirdly, that the distress cues of another produce an affective reaction in some observers, which is interpreted as an excitation (contrast empathy), and functions to reinforce the use of violence. (Empathic arousal functioning as a facilitator of aggression).
 
 During phase 1 of the research the psychometric properties of the empathy measure, currently used with offenders, were examined in an offender sample. Results from 88 violent offenders indicated that the measure was not suitable for use with offender samples, and therefore new scales needed to be produced before research could continue. Two scales were constructed; the Negative Affect Intolerance Scale (NAIS) assessed offenders' level of intolerance toward distress cues of others, while the Offender Contrast Affect Scale (OCAS) assessed offenders' level of excitation and enjoyment of the distress cues of others. Once scale construction had been complete, the psychometric properties of the scales were examined using sample of 166 university students. These preliminary results indicated that both scales were reliable and valid.
 
 Phase 2 of the research program began with a pilot study to examine the psychometric properties of the two newly constructed scales with sample of 49 incarcerated male offenders. Both scales once again produced results which supported their reliability and validity. A larger study was then conducted to examine the three theorised roles that empathy may play in either the production or maintenance of aggression. Cluster analysis identified 5 clusters in a sample of 106 sentenced male offenders, based on their responses to a set of scales (including the NAIS and OCAS). Each of these clusters was compared to a Western Australian community sample (43 low SES males). Results supported all three explanations of a relationship between empathy and aggression, within different clusters of offenders.
 
 The final phase of research involved postulating a theoretical role for cognitive aspects of empathy (perspective taking) in the production or inhibition of aggression. It was argued that, despite the apparent simplicity with which the construct has been dealt with in the literature, perspective taking should be considered a two dimensional construct (frequency and accuracy). When considered in this way, perspective taking may provide additional guidance in the study and treatment of human aggression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/355/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurship and business innovation</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Alan</field><field name="description">This study has examined the knowledge required for the publication of an Entrepreneurship and Business Innovation (E&amp;BI) focused teaching text.

Data collection occurred through formal research, discovery and exploration of knowledge rather than verification, and was subject to my interpretation arising from my participation as an academic.
 
 The analysis of data required a conceptual framework to be developed consistent with the research paradigm, and be so designed as to provide a way for me through a participatory process, to identify and evaluate knowledge in E&amp;BI and investigate the research questions. The study rationalised that E&amp;BI educational programs must first be consistent with, and reflective of, the mission of the institution providing such programs, and also, must address the learning needs of students. Previous research undertaken for this thesis had clearly identified a strong demand for material on E&amp;BI that combined theory and practice with case studies drawn from real world entrepreneurial practices.
 
 The outcome of this study resulted in the design of a formal text that was suitable for use by secondary, community and adult education institutions within Australia, for delivery to both a digital and print audience and representative of international E&amp;BI good practice. The text 'Entrepreneurship and Business Innovation' was published in 2005.
 
 The published text was designed to provide new entrepreneurs and existing Small to Medium Enterprise owners with a practical guide on how to pursue business success based on established entrepreneurial and enterprise management techniques.

One of these advances is the use of the momentum-space convergent closecoupling approach to fully incorporate target atom continua. This theoretical framework is based on the momentum-space Lippmann-Schwinger equation, an integral form of the Schrodinger equation. Although the approach has been highly successful in its application to atomic scattering theory, computing numerical solutions is inherently difficult because the momentum-space LS equation is a singular integral equation. Standard numerical integration techniques are normally employed to solve the problem and as computing power has increased, calculations have improved. However, there remains the problem of the integral's singular nature, which demands complicated methods for selecting integration points, particularly near the energy-dependant singularity. The rotated-contour method uses a conlplex-variable approach that solves the momentum-space LS equation by integrating along a deformed contour in the complex momentum plane away from the singularities. This method has the potential for simplifying the numerical integrations associated with the close-coupling equations.
 
 A rotated-contour method is first applied to a simple scattering model - electron scattering from the Yukawa potential. This gives some insight into the difficulties that arise when calculating potential matrix elements for complex momenta. The method is then applied to the s-wave model of the electron-hydrogen scattering problem and finally, the full problem. Existing FORTRAN software written to solve the momentum-space LS equations for electron-hydrogen scattering using standard techniques has been converted to C++. Extensive modification of the code has resulted in a flexible Windows-based program with a graphical user interface that runs on any modern computer using PC architecture. The program can calculate results using either a conventional method (no rotation) or a rotatedcontour method.
 
 Using a rotated-contour method to solve the momentum-space LS equations necessitates detailed knowledge of the analytic nature and singularity structure of the coupled channels potentials. This is achieved through the extensive use of the computer symbolic algebra system Maple to compute closed-form solutions for the direct potentials and for a range of partial-wave direct and exchange potentials. It is found that logarithmic branch point singularities are present on the real momentum axis for an extensive class of partial-wave direct-potential matrix elements. The analysis reveals that arotated contour method cannot be applied to the full atomic scattering problem due to these analytic problems which are associated with the long-range nature of the Coulomb potential.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/357/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Religious confession privilege at common law: a historical analysis</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Anthony Keith</field><field name="description">Since English lawyers started writing text books about the law of evidence, they have denied that religious confession privilege exists at common law. However, that statement of the law surprises those who recognise confessional secrecy dating back into the first millennium AD. It is also counter-intuitive in Federal Australia since the one human freedom which the Constitution has guaranteed since 1901 is the 'free exercise of any religion'. 
 
 This thesis analyses the legal conclusion that there is no religious confession privilege at common law against available historical materials. Those materials include the origin of confessional secrecy in Christian practice and the entrenchment of that practice in canon law; the recognition and even the reception of canonical practices in the custom that became the common law; and all the English common law cases that have affirmed or denied religious confession privilege whether in passing or in an arguably precedential way. The reason why clear evidence of the existence of the privilege even seventy years after the English Reformation has been ignored by the text writers is traced to an uncorrected interpretive error made by the text writer Peake in 1801.  His error has been uncritically followed and affirmed by later commentators and judges. However, until Gavan Duffy J decided Cook v Carroll in Ireland in 1945 and the Supreme Court of Canada decided R v Gruenke  in 1991, there was no reported decision on religious confession privilege anywhere in the British Commonwealth. All else that had been written was at best obiter dicta.
 
 The factors that influenced those two courts to recognise not a narrow religious confession privilege but a more encompassing confidential religious communications privilege are then measured against Australian jurisprudence to suggest whether the High Court of Australia would come to a similar conclusion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/358/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Swings and round-abouts: discourses of connectedness in secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Greg</field><field name="description">Connectedness is a complex idea that seems to mean different things for each individual. For the purposes of this dissertation, connectedness can best be understood as the ways that an individual feels an affiliation with the community of the institution that he/she experiences. This dissertation seeks to uncover the discourses that various stakeholder groups have within the site of a single school concerning connectedness.
 
 One of the precepts that this dissertation holds is that connectedness to school has benefits for the individual as learner, the school as a community and potentially the wider community in years to come. This is a theoretical position in the lineage of such theorists as Plato, Rousseau, and Dewey who have argued that education is a transformative practice that could be a tool in solving some of the issues that contemporary societies face.
 
 To examine the issue of connectedness, focus group research was chosen as the most beneficial methodology, as it allowed the stakeholders to explore their understanding of connectedness in small groups of their peers. It was important that the students in particular were allowed to develop their discourses of connectedness, as they were at the centre of the converging and diverging discourses. For this reason there were four student focus groups. The students selected for each of the student focus groups were targeted because of particular characteristics. They were purposively sampled to examine how, if at all, these discourses changed if the student was a high achiever, a quiet student, a student committed to the co-curricular programme of the school or a student who had been in regular trouble with the school hierarchy. There were also two parent focus groups, two staff focus groups, and a focus group made up of members of the school council.
 
 The contributions of the various focus groups were analysed in the light of the work done by the French theorist Michel Foucault concerning the institution and the way that it deploys discursive practices to govern and regulate the subject. A number of his ideas that have been particularly important in this work. Foucault's power, discourse and governmentality have informed the analysis of the data and have supported the conclusions drawn. The key finding of this dissertation is that discourses of connectedness are crucial in determining how students feel about their schools. Many of the stakeholder groups hold diverging expectations of what connectedness is. These findings, and others, have implications for the management of schools in Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/359/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of a cognitive-behavioural program on test anxiety symptoms in high school students</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Karolyn</field><field name="description">The current research project has addressed the issue of the stress and anxiety experienced by Australian senior high school students as they prepare to undertake their final year examinations. Two studies were conducted. The first study looked at the feelings experienced by senior high school students, resources available to them to assist with exam preparation, resources actually accessed, and the strategies used to cope with examinations and associated feelings. Focus group interviews were conducted with 14 Year 11 and 13 Year 12 students from a public senior high school in Perth, Western Australia. Results indicated that students tend to most frequently report using avoidance strategies to cope with preparing and undertaking examinations, supporting previous research findings (e.g., Zeidner, 1996).
 
 The second study examined the effectiveness of a group based, cognitive behavioural program purposely designed to teach students strategies for coping specifically with test anxiety and also generalized anxiety symptoms. The program involved seven one-hour weekly sessions implemented with 31 Year 12 students who were undertaking their final year examinations. The program covered education about the nature and causes of stress and anxiety, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, imaginal exposure and study skills training.
 
 The pre- and post-intervention scores on the TAI and RCMAS were analyzed using 2 (group) x 2 (gender) x 3 (symptom severity level) full factorial repeated measures ANOVAS. At pre-intervention, there were no significant differences between the treatment (N=31) and control (N=6), except for RCMAS Worry and Over Sensitivity, whereby the treatment group had a higher mean score, consistent with the greater ratio of female to male participants in the treatment group compared to the control group. At post intervention, the treatment group had reduced scores from preintervention levels for TAI Worry and Emotionality, RCMAS Total Anxiety, Physiological, Worry and Over Sensitivity and the Social Issues and Concentration subscales. In contrast, the post-intervention scores for the control group for these measures had increased from pre-intervention levels. However, there was no significant main effect for Group. Anecdotal program evaluation results from the treatment group students revealed that relaxation training was considered the most helpful aspect of the program. In contrast, at-home practice activities were considered the least helpful. A majority of participating students also reported that they believed the program would help them to manage stress and anxiety associated with examinations and other life stressors.
 
 Despite the lack of significant differences between the treatment and control groups in the current study, the pattern of results obtained generally followed that of previous research on the treatment of symptoms for test anxiety (e.g., Wessel &amp; Mersch, 1994) and generalized anxiety (e.g., Kendall, 1994) employing a CBT approach. While the results of the current study may have been limited by the relatively small sample sizes of the treatment and control groups, the short- and longterm benefits of providing training in appropriate coping strategies for test anxiety, such as those involved in cognitive behavioural intervention, are further highlighted.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/360/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology, ecology and trophic interactions of elasmobranchs and other fishes in riverine waters of Northern Australia</field><field name="creator">Thorburn, Dean Colin</field><field name="description">In light of the extirpation of a number of elasmobranch species commonly encountered in fresh and estuarine waters elsewhere in the world, 39 river systems were sampled throughout northern Australia to determine the species present. A total of 502 elasmobranchs representing 36 species, in addition to 1531 teleosts representing 46 species, were captured. In regard to elasmobranch species known to frequent riverine habitats, the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas was captured in the highest number, followed by the freshwater sawfish Pristis microdon, the freshwater whipray Himantura chaophraya and the dwarf sawfish Pristis clavata. Although these species were generally captured in low numbers, all were widely distributed throughout the region. Furthermore, the waters of King Sound, Western Australia, and the rivers entering it, i.e. the Fitzroy, May and Robinson rivers, were found to contain far higher numbers of P. microdon and P. clavata than any of the other rivers sampled, as well as the northern river shark Glyphis sp. C, and which subsequently provided an ideal locality to study the biology of these species.
 
 The Fitzroy River was shown to act as a nursery for P. microdon and P. clavata, where immature individuals remain for a maximum of four or five years before migrating to marine waters. Investigations of the rostra and rostral tooth morphology of P. microdon indicated their usefulness as a diagnostic tool in differentiating this species from other members of the genus, including P. clavata, and for differentiating between the sexes, i.e. female P. microdon generally possess 17-21 teeth cf. 19-23 teeth in males. However, no significant difference in the number of rostral teeth was found between female and male P. clavata, with both sexes possessing an average of 42. Furthermore, the facts that P. clavata was captured up to 2332 mm in total length and all of the individuals were immature, indicates that the description of this species as a 'dwarf' sawfish is erroneous.
 
 The use of rivers of northern Australia as nurseries was also apparent for C. leucas, with none of the 111 individuals dissected (ranging in length from 681 to 1365 mm TL) being mature. Furthermore, this species appeared to remain within the rivers for approximately four years. Stomach content analysis and field observations confirmed an opportunistic, and often aggressive, feeding nature, and thus the species may pose some risk to bathers utilising inland waters far upstream (i.e. over 300 km).
 
 Morphometrics and radiographs of 10 Glyphis sp. C captured from the macrotidal waters of King Sound (the first capture of this species in Western Australia) indicated that these specimens possessed both a wider range in total vertebral count (i.e. 140-151 cf. 147-148) and number of diplospondylous caudal centra (i.e. 64-70 cf. 65-68) than that previously reported and lent support for its synonymisation with Glyphis gangeticus. Radiographs also revealed the spinal deformation and fusing of vertebrae in three of the ten individuals, which may be attributable to a genetic abnormality indicative of inbreeding within a small gene pool.
 
 Analyses of stomach content and stable carbon ([delta]13C) and nitrogen ([delta]15N) isotope ratios of fishes occurring in the Fitzroy River indicated that the diets of a majority of the species present are broad, and greatly influenced by the seasonal availability of different prey types. While stomach content analysis suggested that aquatic insects, and to a lesser extent filamentous algae, represent vitally important food sources for many of the species present, stable isotope analysis strongly suggested that this latter food source may not be an important direct energy source, and that prey types which persist throughout the year (e.g. fish, molluscs and Macrobrachium rosenbergii) may in fact be more important sources of the energy than dietary data revealed. Dietary overlap was found to be the highest during the wet season when prey availability was high, decreased in the early dry season as fishes became more specialised in their feeding, before increasing again in the late wet when food became very limited. These analyses also supported the views that juvenile fishes may target high energy food items to attain higher growth rates and a large size rapidly, in order to achieve competitive feeding advantages and reduce the risk of predation, and that many species will maximise their energy intake in response to changes in resource availability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/361/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of perceived risk and trust as determinants of online purchasing behaviour: a study within the U.S.A. gemstone industry</field><field name="creator">Tiangsoongnern, Leela</field><field name="description">Several studies have shown that there is a negative impact of perceived risk on trust and on the online purchasing behaviour of buyers. Other research suggests a positive impact. However, these relationships have been suggested by using evidence obtained from the purchase of inexpensive, uncomplicated, and hence low risk products such as books, compact disks (CDs, DVDs), or clothing. Exploring whether such associations could be generalised within the complex, costly high risk and credence products such as gemstones has not been examined. This gap in the literature was addressed in this study. 
 
 The results of the study suggest that perceived risk and trust are significant determinants of the online purchasing behaviour of gemstone buyers.   The study also shows that the type of Internet marketing strategy used by the seller (the place strategy) and the buyer's privacy, and security concerns influence a buyer's perceived risk to purchase gemstones online. Furthermore, Internet fraud protection has been found to be the only significant factor that has an influence on the buyer's trust to purchase gemstones online. These results have implications for the literature, and all sellers and consumers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/362/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In whose interest?: a critical approach to Southeast Asia's urban transport dynamics</field><field name="creator">Townsend, Craig</field><field name="description">During recent decades, urban transport systems in Southeast Asia's industrialising high growth economies were transformed. The ownership and use of privately owned cars and motorcycles grew in all cities, simultaneous to the introduction of new forms of public transportation including rail rapid transit in the larger metropolises. While these cities all experienced dynamic change, the relative rate and direction of the changes to urban transport systems varied greatly as did levels of success.
 
 Singapore emerged as a highly efficient transit metropolis whilst Bangkok and other cities gained notoriety as some of the world's great traffic disasters. Why these differences emerged, particularly given a regional and global context of increasing interaction and exchange of ideas and of capital flows, presents a compelling question largely unanswered by previous research. A review of the general state of knowledge about urban transport worldwide reveals fundamental disagreements over basic questions such as the social value of motorisation, the relative merits of specific modes and technologies, and prescriptions for change. However, there is a general consensus that interest groups or rent-seekers influence urban transport, which can not be understand in solely technical or value-free terms. A literature review focused on Southeast Asian cities finds that in contrast to theoretical perspectives on cities of the industrialised world, there is less acknowledgement of interests and values and more emphasis on instrumental knowledge which can be used to address immediate problems such as rapid growth in motorisation, traffic congestion, and pollution. Questions such as who wins and who loses from changes to urban transport systems are not systematically examined in the existing literature on Southeast Asian cities. In order to address this gap, a case study analysis of three key cities, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore is undertaken. This analysis utilises policy and planning documents, monographs and academic works, newspapers and archival materials, discussions with key informants, and participant observation, to reveal the significant actors and processes which shape urban transport. 
 
 The study finds that the presence or absence of actors and complexions of interests in the development of urban land, urban transport equipment, infrastructure construction and operation, and local environmental improvements are linked to specific urban transport outcomes. The findings provide a basis for future research, particularly in cities of the developing world characterised by economic growth, rapid motorisation of urban transport systems, and substantial inequalities of wealth and power.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/363/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rock'n'roll cinema</field><field name="creator">Trainer, Adam</field><field name="description">Popular music and film are separate media, framed by specific discourses, histories of distribution and reception, semiotic relationships and literacies. Through these divergent manifestations and ideologies nodes of convergence exist. At moments of connection, new and innovative textual and contextual possibilities emerge, transforming the ways in which audiences both engage and read these media. Whilst often driven by capitalist goals, both popular music and film capture and tether personal expression and collective memory. Through these processes of signification, popular cultural texts belonging to both media forms are able to resist their commodified origins to inform and construct both collective and individual identities.
 
 This thesis charts the movement of popular music across cinema. Rock'n'Roll is utilized not only as an amalgam of texts made up of sounds and images, but also as a critical and interpretative apparatus through which specific cultural identities are configured. This work is concerned with various manifestations of political resistance in popular culture, and the ways in which this resistance is moderated through cultural commodification. Using an interdisciplinary approach - converging film analysis, popular music studies and music journalism - this thesis constructs an ideological framework through which film and popular music can be aligned, and through which this alignment can be researched.
 
 Through an engagement with myriad cinematic and popular cultural texts, executed  through interdisciplinary methods, this thesis establishes a theoretical framework for understanding and analyzing the convergence of popular music and cinema. Its original contribution to knowledge is an evaluation of the ways in which these media are changed through their alignment and how they inform each other both structurally, as tangible manifestations of specific media codes and structures, and politically, in the ideological embodiment of particular identities and representational realities. This goal is achieved through the selection of specific research materials, especially those which have not been subject to detailed investigation in other scholarly studies. Specific filmic and musical texts are discussed because they embody the aesthetic and political synergy of these two media forms as well as demonstrating the cultural processes through which this synergy is enacted.
 
 This thesis offers interdisciplinary dialogue as a valid strategy to understand the processes involved in the creation and reception of texts which are cinematic in nature but utilize the language and discourse of popular music. The textual and contextual manifestations of this process are a primary concern. Emphasis is placed on the implications for film form in terms of the structure of texts and their existence within specific genres, the shifting position of the auteur and the renegotiation of the term and its meaning to film and popular music, and the conjunction and interaction between creativity and commerce. In addressing the political and aesthetic possibilities of the film and popular music hybrid, as well as the cultural implications of their convergence, this thesis provides new perspectives for the analysis of both forms.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/364/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dogs, humans and gastrointestinal parasites: unravelling epidemiological and zoonotic relationships in an endemic tea-growing community in Northeast India</field><field name="creator">Traub, Rebecca Justine</field><field name="description">A simultaneous survey of canine and human gastrointestinal (GI) parasites was conducted in three socioeconomically disadvantaged, tea-growing communities in Assam, India. The aims of this study were to determine the epidemiology of GI parasites of zoonotic significance in dogs and geohelminth infection in humans using a combination of molecular biological and classical parasitological and epidemiological tools.
 
 A total of 328 and 101 dogs participated in the study. The prevalence of GI parasites in dogs was 99%. Parasitic stages presumed to be host-specific for humans such as Ascaris spp., Trichuris trichiura and Isospora belli were also encountered in dog faeces. A polymerase chain reaction - linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) was developed to identify the species of Ascaris eggs in dog faeces. The results supported the dog's role as a significant disseminator and environmental contaminator of Ascaris lumbricoides, in communities where promiscuous defecation by humans exist. The prevalence, intensity and associated risk factors for infection with Ascaris, hookworms and Trichuris were also determined among the human population. The overall prevalence of Ascaris was 38% and 43% for both hookworms and Trichuris. 
 
 The strongest predictors for the intensity of geohelminths included socioeconomic status, age, household crowding, level of education and lack of footwear when outdoors. 
 
 The zoonotic potential of canine Giardia was investigated by genetically characterising G. duodenalis isolates recovered from humans and dogs at three different loci. Phylogenetic analysis placed canine Giardia isolates within the genetic groupings of human isolates. Further evidence for zoonotic transmission was supported by strong epidemiological data. A highly sensitive and specific PCR RFLP based test was developed to detect and differentiate the species of canine hookworms directly from eggs in faeces.

 This newly developed PCR-based test provided a rapid, highly sensitive and specific tool for the epidemiological screening of canine Ancylostoma species in a community.

Key elements of China's economic development model - THE CHINESE MODEL - based on the steel industry are presented and demonstrate the impact of China taking 'great leaps forward' in its steel production capacity to become the world's leading steel producer and one of the fastest growing economies. This bold step was undertaken at times when the global steel industry was burdened with overcapacity and economic pressures. At the same time, this thesis examines the role played by the Australian iron ore industry in supporting the Chinese steel industry through its iron ore trade with China and how this role will evolve.
 
 The development of the iron and steel industry in China reflects not just the role played in the overall expansion of the Chinese economy through technical input-output relationships, but it also reflects control and historical characteristics taken from China's social and political context. Starting from the views of Sun Yat Sen, and flowing through Mao Zedong, and then into later leaders, the steel industry was always intended to be the basis for the modernisation of the Chinese economy. The Great Leap Forward of the 1950s was an ill-founded reflection of that fundamental view, but the failure in that case did not cause a shift away from that basic perspective. Instead a more comprehensive perspective was provided and this came to the fore at the start of there form process in the early 1980s.The role of the steel industry in the recent modernisation of China is traced using the policy foundations and directions that were adopted combined with empirical data on the investment and growth in the industry, as well as the role of the output of the steel industry in the expansion of other industries in China. To the extent that conditions in China may be replicated in other countries, the Chinese experience using the iron and steel industry as the key element in the industrialisation of that economy will have important lessons.
 
 At the same time, this thesis demonstrates weaknesses in a development model that has the iron and steel industry as the leading sector. One major weakness is the reliance on imported raw materials and at this point the Chinese experience with Australia as a source of raw materials becomes relevant. Australia's role as a reliable supplier and partner for the steel industry enabled the steel industry to expand in a low risk environment with respect to the price and availability of raw materials.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/367/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Archi-texture: meditations on the mediations of dwelling</field><field name="creator">Blake, Wendy Seana</field><field name="description">This thesis is an inter-disciplinary and inter- cultural exploration of home as understood as the place in which we usually live. Empirical research in an Australian suburb and an Indian town provide the fabric from which cultural studies engages with phenomenology to produce a design used to cut and style this exploration. Motivated by an interest in what threads contribute to the weave of contemporary household dwelling, this thesis revisits the two questions used by Heidegger to frame his essay 'Building Dwelling Thinking': What is it to dwell? and How does building belong to dwelling? It is an inquiry committed to its respondents as bearers and representatives of 'structures of feeling' circulating within the socio-cultural milieu or habitus in which they live and engage with the idea of 'home'. This inquiry offers an exploration of the chief constituent mediums of home which I call its 'archi-texture'. As such, it looks at location, physical and material attributes, domestic technology and household membership as framed by the presence or absence of a family. This thesis is almost certainly the only example of an empirically grounded examination of Heidegger?s ontological exposition of dwelling. Hence I position it as a meditation on the mediations of dwelling rather than a judgmental critique, although in no sense do I believe it to be either a dispassionate position nor an impartial digest of the research material.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/368/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Deakinite myth exposed: other accounts of constitution-makers, constitutions and citizenship</field><field name="creator">Trenorden, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">As argued throughout this thesis, in his personification of the federal story, if not immediately in his formulation of its paternity, Deakin's unpublished memoirs anticipated the way that federation became codified in public memory.  The long and tortuous process of federation was rendered intelligible by turning it into a narrative set around a series of key events.  For coherence and dramatic momentum the narrative dwelt on the activities of, and words of, several notable figures.  To explain the complex issues at stake it relied on memorable metaphors, images and descriptions.
 
 Analyses of class, citizenship, or the industrial confrontations of the 1890s, are given little or no coverage in Deakinite accounts.  Collectively, these accounts are told in the words of the victors, presented in the images of the victors, clothed in the prejudices and predilections of the victors, while the losers are largely excluded.  Those who spoke out against or doubted the suitability of the constitution, for whatever reason, have largely been removed from the dominant accounts of constitution-making.  More often than not they have been 'character assassinated' or held up to public ridicule by Alfred Deakin, the master narrator of the Conventions and federation movement and by his latter-day disciples.  Those who opposed Deakin I have labelled anti-Deakinites.
 
 To anti-Deakinites, the journey to federation was characterised by compromises and concessions that reflected or produced a series of exclusions (of individuals, groups and ideas) from Deakinite stories of federation, often for reasons of political exigency.  They acknowledge that compromises had to be made in bringing about federation.  Men with a national viewpoint they believe, often acquiesced to states' rights men whose primary interest was a good deal for their state or colony.  Anti-Deakinites are critical of the heroes in Deakinite accounts (of the Ultra-Federalists) believing that these men would have federated any time after 1891 with an undemocratic and illiberal constitution.
 
 Events that were to influence the course of Australian history took place during the 1880-90s.  Yet the dominant accounts of constitution-making do not acknowledge the context within which the constitution was written.  It is difficult denying that these must have influenced the Constitution-makers as they began their work in 1891.  The central claim of my thesis is that many accounts of Australian constitution-making and federation have been selective in their descriptions of the events and the organisations and individuals involved, leading to the misrepresentation of these seminal episodes in Australian history.  This misrepresentation has occurred as a consequence of the privileging of, what I label, the Deakinite account of constitution-making and federation over all others.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/369/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Full-fee paying international students at Murdoch University 1985-1991: a policy case study</field><field name="creator">Trestrail, Colin</field><field name="description">In 1985 the Australian Government announced a momentous policy initiative allowing Australian universities to enrol full-fee paying international students for the first time. This case study is an analysis of the policy development that ensued at Murdoch University between 1985 and 1991 as it responded to this opportunity to alleviate problems, with finance and low student numbers, that were threatening its very existence as an independent university.  In particular, it examines the factors that had placed Murdoch in such a parlous situation, and the reasons why it was able to respond quickly and effectively so as to implement a highly successful and comprehensive program for the recruitment, enrolment and support of full-fee paying international students.
 
 The case study format allowed for the use of a wide range of data sources.  Sources of documentary evidence included: formal written works about the events and concepts under investigation, newspapers and other media items, letters, memoranda, agendas and minutes of meetings, and other internal Murdoch University documents.  In addition, archival materials such as annual reports, budgets and financial records were consulted.  Verification and extension of the documentary and archival evidence was gained from interviews with past and present staff and students of Murdoch University who had been involved with the program.
 
 The study found that organisational changes initiated by successive Vice-Chancellors in the 1980s had replaced a slow and unresponsive, collegial style of decision-making, based on very wide consultation, with a more centralised, bureaucratic and market-oriented system.  New, streamlined procedures, and the devolution of policy-development to small, semi-autonomous committees, enabled the University to rapidly develop policies and procedures for the inauguration of a program for full-fee paying international students in 1987.  The continued success of the program, both in terms of enrolment numbers and financial returns, was found to be based on the creation and development of an almost independent, and entrepreneurial, International Office for the organisation of most aspects of the program, including the marketing and recruitment process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/370/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solution chemistry of some dicarboxylate salts of relevance to the Bayer process</field><field name="creator">Tromans, Andrew John</field><field name="description">These ions are either significant impurities in the concentrated alkaline aluminate solutions used in the Bayer process for the purification of alumina, or are useful models for degraded organic matter in industrial Bayer liquors. Such impurities are known to have important effects on the operation of the Bayer process. To develop a better understanding of the speciation of oxalate (the major organic impurity in Bayer liquors) in concentrated electrolyte solutions, the formation constant (Log Beta) of the extremely weak ion pair formed between sodium (Na+) and oxalate (Ox2-) ions was determined at 25 degrees C as a function if ionic strength in TMACl media by titration using a Na+ ion selective electrode. Attempts to measure this constant in CsCl media were unsuccessful probably because of competition for Ox2 by Cs+. 
 
 Aqueous solutions of sodium malonate (Na2Mal) and sodium succinate (Na2Suc) were studied up to high (saturation) concentrations at 25 degrees C by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) over the approximate frequency range 0.1 less-equal v/GHz less-equal 89. To complement a previous study of Na2Ox, formation constants of the Na+-dicarboxylate ion pairs were determined and they were shown to be of the solvent-shared type. Both the Mal2- and Suc2- ions, in contrast to Ox2-, were also shown to possess large secondary hydration shells.
 
 Apparent molal volumes (V[phi]) and heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp[phi]) of aqueous solutions of Na2Ox, Na2Suc, Na2Mal and K2Ox were determined at 25 degrees C up to their saturation limits using vibrating tube densitometry and flow calorimetry. These data were fitted using a Pitzer model. The adherence of V[phi] and Cp[phi] of various Na+ and K+ salts to Young's rule was examined up to high concentrations using the present and literature data. Young's rule was then used to estimate hypothetical values of CpV[phi] and V[phi] for the sparingly soluble Na2Ox at high ionic strengths, which are required for the thermodynamic modelling of Bayer liquors.
 
 The solubility of Na2Ox in various concentrated electrolytes was measured, at temperatures from 25 degrees C to 70 degrees C in media both with (NaCl, NaClO4, NaOH) and without a common ion (KCl, CsCl, TMACl). The common ion effect was found to dominate the solubility of Na2Ox. The solubility of calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaOx.H2O) was also determined. The solubilities of both Na2Ox and CaOx.H2O in media without a common ion increased with increasing electrolyte concentration, except in TMACl media, where they decreased. The solubility of Na2Ox was modelled using a Pitzer model assuming the Pitzer parameters for Na2SO4 and minimising the free energy of the system. The data were modelled successfully over the full concentration and temperature range of all the electrolytes, including ternary (mixed electrolyte) solutions.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/371/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the developmental influences that shape the contemporary practice of beginning and advanced spiritual directors</field><field name="creator">Truscott, Stephen Austin</field><field name="description">This study explores the similar and different developmental influences that shape the practice of beginning and advanced spiritual directors. An examination of the contemporary literature on spiritual direction finds that in the main, two developmental influences shape the practice of contemporary spiritual directors: their capacity to adopt a contemplative stance towards their directees and their ability to be aware contextually of the factors that fashion the dynamic of accompaniment. While the review highlights the presence of these two influences, the literature is deficient in understanding the similarities and differences in how these two influences shape the practice of beginning and advanced spiritual directors. To address the deficiency, this study reviews three groups of Western Australian spiritual directors, Anglican, Churches of Christ and Roman Catholic. The investigation takes a qualitative, ethnographic approach, using focus groups. An analysis and discussion of the data confirms that the similarities and differences in the influences that shape their practice revolve around two key developmental influences namely, the capacity of directors to adopt a contemplative stance to their directees, and their ability to be aware contextually of the factors that fashion the dynamic of accompaniment. While both influences shape beginning and advanced directors, the former impacts more on the practice of beginning directors and the latter more affects advanced directors. 
 
 Two factors may initiate and sustain the capacity of directors to adopt a contemplative stance. First, directors grow by noticing and attending to all the dimensions of their human experience. Second, directors develop by having their experience attended to in some form of therapeutic relationship or through participation in various developmental group processes. 
 
 Directors may enhance their capacity to be aware contextually of the factors that fashion the dynamic of accompaniment through understanding paradigms about spiritual direction practice and spiritual development. Their appreciation of paradigms about spiritual direction may derive from two sources. The first is by how they distinguish more effectively spiritual direction from other therapeutic practices. The second is by how they grow in understanding relevant theological, philosophical, and psychological perspectives that inform good practice. Directors may further increase their comprehension of interpretive frameworks about spiritual development by redressing the attitudinal effects of fundamentalism and incorporating a multiplicity of approaches to spirituality. Training programmes are an important means to introduce and develop directors' abilities to be aware contextually of the factors that fashion the dynamic of accompaniment. A person's ecclesial role may influence the context in which a director commences practice. From this discussion, this study draws conclusions and offers recommendations applicable to practice and research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/372/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Malaysian state and the regulation of labour: from colonial economy to k-economy</field><field name="creator">Turner, Donna Isabelle</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the state-labour nexus emerging out of the processes through which governing authorities have attempted to maintain or regain political stability and rates of accumulation in Malay(a)sia. Existing studies usefully highlight the extent to which repressive industrial relations legislation and ethnic communalism have weakened the trade union movement and segmented the labour force delivering the relative industrial peace attractive to foreign investors. Some suggest labour's discontent at this repression has been successfully contained by Malaysia's relatively strong economic performance. These approaches, however, only partially acknowledge the extent to which labour's social reproduction under capitalist relations generates political and economic contradictions. 
 
 After an initial failure to address these contradictions in the early post-colonial era, the Malay-dominated government has since developed avenues through which to deliver economic and cultural concessions in a selective and paternalistic fashion. This economic paternalism has contributed to social stability but has diverted funds from economic development and now runs contrary to structural reforms that seek to address Malaysia's declining international competitiveness. The transition towards a knowledge-based economy, referred to locally as the k-economy, therefore embodies efforts by the political elite to contain political and societal tensions emerging out of the reform process. This thesis demonstrates and analyses the dynamic, contingent and uneven nature of these efforts as the government seeks to establish new bases of legitimacy more closely linked to household consumption concerns than ethnicity. Despite the relative absence of industrial disputation, labour's location in Malaysia's system of capitalism remains a contradictory one. Politically motivated social policies, although under pressure and likely to take new forms, will nonetheless remain pivotal in the attempt to resolve the tensions that threaten accumulation and political stability.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/373/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competing myths of nationalist identity: ideological perceptions of conflict in Ambon, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Turner, Kathleen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the 1999-2003 case of political conflict in Ambon, in Eastern Indonesia, in the context of political change in Indonesia from 1950-1998. It is argued that political transformation during this period was closely influenced by a much longer period of unprecedented social change preceding the politics of this period. It is suggested that the ideologisation of ethnic identities is likely to occur when structures of community are disrupted by changes in the contemporary world such as economic fluctuations or state policy interventions. One result is to disrupt traditional village communities so as to place individuals in stress situations making them susceptible to new nationalist ideologies. The other impact is to dislocate authority structures so that both incumbent and aspiring elites lose their power and authority and thus search for new ways in order to re-establish their moral and political legitimacy.
 
 It is argued that nationalism is able to offer a resolution to social disruption and thus to the community in search of social cohesion, while also functioning to rebuild elite authority. In ethnic nationalist ideology, insecurities and feelings of isolation are ameliorated by subsequent constructions of 'us' and 'them' where members of one distinct community are demarcated from other communities. It is suggested that myths of ancestry and homeland together with counterposed moral dichotomies appealed to the Ambonese who needed this form of ideological support. It is the insecurities and fear experienced by disrupted communities which promote this powerful ideological formula.  
 
 It is asserted that conflict on the island has been characterised by this trend towards ideological absolutism where two conflicting ideological constructions have translated the conflict into a non-negotiable confrontation between opposing national rights. It is argued that these two ideological constructions have remained internalised on the island and embedded within the mindsets of both Ambonese Christians and Muslims, thereby rendering setbacks to conflict resolution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/374/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The poetics of being</field><field name="creator">Vaernes, Rolf</field><field name="description">The aim of The Poetics of Being is to inquire into how the apperception of the Being of beings is produced. We will recognize this production not primarily in philosophy, but in a medium accessible to us all, theatre. Although the Romantic tradition of literary criticism from Herder to Bloom has noted that Shakespeare produces an exceptional sense of what is [true], so much so that he is said to create the impression of nature or life, no one has so far attempted to show how precisely Shakespeare affects this experience. Contrary to T. S. Eliot, who is unable to discern any kind of poetics in Shakespeare's plays, we have discovered an insistent and consistent pattern of inadequation, a kind of mismatch. The thesis argues, that the predominant tropes of inadequation are falsity, dissimilarity, nothing, indefinition, elision and substitution. We shall show that these figures of inadequation are the universal means by which Shakespeare, almost imperceptibly, compels the spectator to infer the apperception of what is [true].
 
 On the basis of these tropes of inadequation the thesis makes the fundamental philosophical claim that the cognition of Being through non-Being is a negative form of what Heidegger calls the ontological difference. We call this the negative ontological difference. The thesis demonstrates that with the exception of some Pre-Socratic thinkers, Plato in the Sophist, the work of Pseudo-Dionysius, and the writings of Derrida, the bulk of the tradition of Western philosophy has argued Being in terms of positivities. While the thesis does not question the possibility of realizing the ontological difference in a positive fashion, as does Heidegger's philosophy of unconcealment, the thesis claims that the negative ontological difference, or ontological contradiction, is the more forceful process by which we become aware of what is [true].</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/376/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water flow in seagrass ecosystems</field><field name="creator">van Keulen, Michael</field><field name="description">Water motion has been shown to influence almost every aspect of the ecology of seagrass communities; seagrass communities have likewise been shown to significantly influence water movement around them. This thesis examines the important role of water motion on seagrass ecosystems by integrating field and laboratory studies of several aspects of seagrass ecology influenced by water motion.
 
 To facilitate the study of hydrodynamics of seagrass ecosystems, a solid state electronic current meter was designed and developed, using thermistors as flow sensing devices. Important characteristics of the meters include: no moving parts, compact size, high sensitivity (resolution better than plus-minus 0.5 cm s-1), and high sampling rate (greater than 0.2 Hz). Deployment of the meters in field measurements provided reliable and meaningful results of flow conditions through seagrass canopies, and they show great potential for use in many studies of marine ecology.
 
 Field studies of water velocity profiles revealed significant differences between the shapes of profiles of different seagrass species, particularly between species of Posidonia and Amphibolis. Of particular note is the observation of a region of high water velocity beneath the leafy canopy of Amphibolis, which was not present in the Posidonia plants. 
 
 Water velocity profile measurements, sediment grain size analyses and standing stock measurements were conducted across an exposure gradient in a Posidonia sinuosa meadow. These studies revealed that, while the exposed location experienced a higher ambient water velocity than the sheltered site, the baffling influence of the seagrass canopy reduced the water velocity to approximately the same at both sites, within the meadow, although the effects varied seasonally. It was also observed that the seagrass meadow produced apparent skimming flow under the low flow conditions measured at the sheltered location; this phenomenon reflects the capacity for flow redirection over the canopy, and has important implications for the sub-canopy ecosystem and the protective role of seagrasses on the seabed.
 
 Field and laboratory studies on the role of seagrass density on the hydrodynamic nature of seagrass ecosystems revealed that water velocity profiles through meadows of reduced densities, and different shoot arrangements, were markedly different to 'natural' profiles, implying the existence of a 'critical density' (approximately 25 % of natural meadow density) with regard to canopy hydraulics.
 
 The role of water motion at an individual leaf scale was investigated with a series of laboratory flume studies of photosynthetic rates of seagrass and algae. The results show that the response of photosynthetic rate to water velocity depends very much on the plant species, with the algae markedly more productive (on a unit chlorophyll basis) than the seagrasses tested. Increases in photosynthetic rate were observed at water velocities above approximately 2.5 cm s-1; negligible photosynthetic activity was observed below this velocity. Calculation of P v. I curves indicated that the Posidonia species had high Ik values at low velocities (1360 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for P. australis and 250.8 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for P. sinuosa at 1.58 cm s-1), which decreased with increasing water velocity (to 138.9 and 24.77 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for P. australis and P. sinuosa respectively), while the algal species had relatively constant values of Ik across all water velocities (85.42 to 312.7 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for Ulva lactuca and 169.7 to 573.9 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for Laurencia cruciata). Dye visualization studies showed that the algae remained quite rigid at all the velocities tested, while the seagrass leaves compressed as velocity increased. This resulted in an increased rate of turbulence creation by the algae, which is believed to enhance photosynthetic rates, through improved nutrient exchange rates across the boundary layer adjacent to the thallus.
 
 Further dye visualization studies revealed the significance of blade morphology on the creation of microscale turbulence at the surface of seagrass leaves. Epiphytic growth on seagrass leaves was observed to play an important role in breaking up water flow across the leaf surface, thereby enhancing the creation of microscale turbulence.
 
 From these studies, it is clear that water motion influences all aspects of the functioning of all components of seagrass communities, playing a role in nutrient supply, reproduction, physical stability, temperature and metabolic functions. The influence of seagrass meadows on coastal hydrodynamics is also apparent, with potential impacts on sediment stability, recruitment of benthic species and coastal erosion. This thesis has clearly demonstrated that water motion is an important parameter in seagrass ecology, and requires serious consideration in seagrass research, conservation and rehabilitation programmes.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/377/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The women from Rhodesia: an auto-ethnographic study of immigrant experience and [Re] aggregration in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Venables, Eleanor</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the positioning of white, English-speaking, immigrant women from Africa to Australia. I explore the effects that minimal differences have on issues of identity. Notions of identity, memory, and belonging are contrasted with white settlement in Rhodesia in the last century. My personal history and the desire to write a thesis relevant to the Australian experience led me to ask, How do women from a privileged background, from Rhodesia and Zimbabwe, understand their experiences as immigrants to Australia? The relevance lies in the perception that Australia is populated by immigrants and this research interrogates at a deeper level some specific issues presented by this sample group and my interpretation of their experiences augments the literature in this area. I questioned (individually) a small group of immigrants using unstructured interviews; the use of my own experiences and 'long/desk drawer' makes the study significantly autobiographical. Notions of migration into Australia from Southern Africa are explored using theories and themes of rites de passage. I interrogate the meanings attributed to assimilation and integration in immigration and connect these to the theory. Identity, memory, and reflection are discussed in the context of separation from Africa and integration into Australia. The similarities and differences and embodied history (habitus) that shape us, interweave the trope of rites de passage, uncovering a multiplicity of identity-attributed, assumed, and self-determined. I examine the ways in which Australians of Anglo-Saxon and British origin tend to position English-speaking immigrants from non-British backgrounds as outsiders and suggest that this attribution has more to do with similarities than differences. Reflection and discussion of other times and places reveals how memories intersect with 'new' lives in Australia and the complexities of time in migration as rites de passage make possible an exploration of present experience shadowing earlier experience. Finally, I discover that identity and belonging as continually negotiated spaces are illuminated by the contrast I drew between assimilation and integration as conceptual tools in understanding the migrant experience.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/378/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problem solving policing in the police service of Western Australia: the impact of organizational structure and culture</field><field name="creator">Boaks, William John</field><field name="description">In 1996 the Police Service of Western Australia embarked on a major and ongoing period of change regarding all aspects of local policing. Part of this program involved the adoption of a number of practices that included an undertaking to pay increased attention to issues such as a customer focus, problem solving, a commitment to developing and motivating personnel, a localised delivery of policing services and improved management practices. 
 
 This research was conducted for the purpose of uncovering the factors that create the unique environment of the Police Service of Western Australia and exploring how these might impact upon the manner in which officers conduct their daily duties. More specifically the purpose was to determine if there existed any aspects of organizational culture or structure that have an influence on the ability and/or willingness of officers to carry out their duties according to the processes and procedures of either the problem solving or the problem-oriented policing philosophy. 
 
 The research methodology was guided by the grounded theory approach. Twenty-eight interviews were conducted with constables, sergeants, inspectors and superintendents as it was considered that these ranks best represented the views of the members of the organization in terms of numbers and those most affected by day-to-day events.
 
 The data analysis revealed the existence of 13 factors that all exhibit negative aspects and collectively create a Basic Social Problem that has been termed 'Feeling Vulnerable'. Although all of these factors have been well known for many years, the current research integrates these in a new way in order to produce a model of the organization that demonstrates how they combine to create an environment that is counter-productive to the implementation of a problem-solving or problem-oriented approach to policing by members of The Police Service of Western Australia at many levels.
 
 The Basic Social Process disclosed by the current research has been termed 'Controlling By Avoidance'. It is based on four tactics used by officers to control their working environment. The employment of one or more of these tactics by officers is designed to give the impression of engaging with issues while simultaneously exerting control over events in order to prevent the occurrence of outcomes that experience tells them are likely to have undesirable personal consequences. The intention is to create an environment where they hope to be safe from the consequences of problems that will inevitably occur at some time.
 
 As well as providing an explanation for the conduct of officers under the problem solving model the analysis also provides an insight into why the organization has apparently avoided coming to grips with the implementation of the full Goldstein model of problem-oriented policing. This appears to be due to concerns on the part of senior management about the likelihood of a loss of control over subordinate ranks and the personal problems that this would generate for them.
 
 Recommendations are made about the need to adopt the Goldstein model and the steps required to successfully implement this approach are listed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/379/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing nature: the infinite in the flesh</field><field name="creator">Victorin-Vangerud, Robert Daniel</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relation between two interpretations of chora, drawn from a reading of Plato's Timaeus. The first I label the elemental chora. The second, I call the social chora. The first chapter addresses the elements in Ionian philosophy, with an eye toward the political and social backdrop of the important cosmological notion of isonomia, law of equals. Here social and elemental are continuous. Chapter two looks at the next phase of Presocratic thought, Elea, specifically Parmenides and his influence on later thought, then turns to Heidegger's reading of Parmenides' through the key word of aletheia. Finally, I offer a reading of Parmenides through a different key word - trust. The third chapter examines Plato's cosmology in the Timaeus, focusing on the way the beginning of this dialogue inflects the dialogue in a political/social direction, putting the social chora in tension with the elemental chora that the body of the Timaeus' discusses. In the fourth chapter, which examines the Phaedrus, this tension is inverted, since this dialogue on writing and justice set in what proves to be the mesmerizing and erotic elemental milieu of the world outside the walls of the polis. The second half of the dissertation turns to some modern thinkers within the phenomenological tradition or its wake who write about elementals. Chapter five examines Gaston Bachelard's reveries on imagination which dream the natural world of fire, air, water, and earth from the standpoint of what he calls material and dynamic imagination, concepts that imply a strong sense of embodiment. Chapter six treats Levinas' description of the elemental and fixes it in a stark relation to the human. I will suggest some possible points of contact between the elemental and the social in Levinas. Chapter seven turns to John Sallis' analysis of the imagination as the means of access proper to the elemental in ways that differ from Bachelard. He position the earth as a fundamental other. I will suggest that in the end his position inherits Heidegger's lack of emphasis on embodied and needy humanity. Alphonso Lingis offers his own unique reading of the elemental in a more Levinasian and Merleau-Pontian vein, speaking of the directives the world, both human and natural, puts to us, and returning to a philosophy of substance that puts the body in the picture. Chapter eight uses his thought to focus the issue of the dissertation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/380/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of infection with leptospira species in livestock in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Wai'in, Peter Meiwan</field><field name="description">The role of infection with Leptospira as a cause of infertility in Papua New Guinea(PNG) has not been confirmed, mainly because of the lack of robust and simple diagnostic tests in PNG. The aims of this study were to determine the seroprevalence and distribution of infection in livestock in PNG and to develop and validate a diagnostic test for use in PNG that was sufficiently accurate and reliable for confident interpretation of the results. The nested and real-time PCRs were assessed for use as diagnostic tools.
 
 The first survey was conducted on 3 commercial, 3 smallholder cattle farms and 4 abattoirs in March 2004 in PNG. Each herd was stratified into 3 age groups (&lt;2, 2-5 and &gt;5 years), and sera from 1379 animals were sampled in Lae and Kimbe. In addition, 73 kidneys were collected from cattle at the abattoir and aseptically processed for culture. Two hundred and eighty three sera were collected from pigs killed at the abattoirs and 79 pig kidneys were collected and cultured. All sera were tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). The dominant serovar infecting the cattle in PNG was Hardjo with a seroprevalence of 53.7%. The prevalence of serovar Hardjo in the six farms and the abattoir was significantly higher than serovars Tarassovi and Pomona (P &lt; 0.05). All pig sera were negative for Leptospira. Leptospires were isolated by culture and the isolates were typed and identified as L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo. Cattle are a recognized reservoir for serovar Hardjo and may have a role in transmission to humans.
 
 The second survey was conducted in June 2006 to determine if cattle from smallholder farmers, village pigs and dogs in the Markham Valley in Lae, PNG were infected with Leptospira. In addition, pigs from a commercial piggery and horses from commercial and smallholder farms were also sampled. A total of 69 pig sera, 22 dog sera, 15 horse sera and 111 cattle sera were collected. The results showed that 1 dog and 1 pig were seropositive with serovar Canicola. Of the 111 cattle sampled, 21 were seropositive for Hardjo. It was concluded that the seroprevalence with serovar Hardjo in these cattle was significantly lower than cattle from commercial properties. Smallholder cattle may therefore not be a major source of Hardjo infection for animals on commercial farms and pigs do not appear to be infected with Leptospira.
 
 The Ab-ELISAs were constructed using one crude preparations of L. interrogans serovar Pomona and 2 different crude preparation of L. biflexa serovar Patoc. The three antigen preparations were evaluated using 21 MAT-positive and 96 MAT-negative pig sera to determine which antigen preparation was suitable for use in an Ab-ELISA. The selected antigen preparation (L1) was validated in the test using serum from 2 cattle and 1 pig population that were seropositive for Leptospira. A sub-population of seronegative cattle and pigs were also used. The Ab-ELISA was used to test 1,465 bovine sera from 8 cattle populations and the results were compared with the MAT using a Bayesian framework, to obtain an unbiased estimate of the accuracy of the tests. The ELISA had high sensitivity and specificity. Results from the Bayesian analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity estimates for the Ab-ELISA were high compared to the MAT. Based on the test accuracy and its performance the Ab-ELISA using the L1 antigen described in this study is suitable for use in countries like PNG where the MAT is difficult to perform.
 
 Samples of kidneys from livestock in PNG were tested using culture and a PCR-based assay to detect Leptospira species. A total of 72 samples of kidney were collected from cattle and a total of 74 samples were collected from pigs slaughtered in Lae and Port Moresby. A second study was designed to assess the use of a real-time PCR for detecting leptospiral DNA in urine from cattle. One hundred and ninety-three urine samples were collected from a beef cattle farm in WA. Whole genomic DNA from kidney samples was extracted from each kidney using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Heat lysis was used to extract genomic DNA from clear urine samples and the QIAamp Mini Kit was used for urine that was contaminated with faeces. The PCR-based test was able to detect a higher number of Leptospira-positive kidneys compared to culture in EMJH medium. Results of testing DNA extracted from urine using the realtime PCR showed that this test is sensitive and able to detect cattle infected with pathogenic leptospires.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/381/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Latitudinal and temporal comparisons of the reproductive biology and growth of snapper, Pagrus auratus (Sparidae), in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Wakefield, Corey Brion</field><field name="description">This study focused on obtaining sound quantitative data on the reproductive biology, length and age compositions and growth of the snapper Pagrus auratus in the waters off Carnarvon at ca 25oS and Perth at ca 32oS on the west coast of Australia and at ca 34oS on the south coast of Western Australia. Sampling thus encompassed both sub-tropical and temperate waters and the geographical range within which this species is abundant in Western Australia. The resultant data were used to explore the ways in which the biological characteristics of P. auratus differ with latitude and thus water temperature. An intensive sampling regime for eggs and spawning individuals of P. auratus was conducted in Cockburn Sound, a large marine embayment in the Perth region at ca 32oS. The resultant data were used to elucidate where and when spawning occurs in this large marine embayment and to determine more precisely the factors that influence the timing of spawning. The implications of the results presented in this thesis for the management of P. auratus, a species that has been subjected to very heavy fishing pressure in recent years, are discussed.
 
 The time and duration of spawning of P. auratus in the subtropical waters of Carnarvon differed markedly from those recorded for this sparid in the temperate and cooler waters of the Perth and the south coast regions. Spawning at Carnarvon occurred predominantly in the five months between late autumn (May) and mid spring (September), whereas it took place mainly in the three months between mid spring (October) and early summer (December) in the Perth region. Spawning of P. auratus on the south coast occurred predominantly in October and November in 2003 and 2004 and scarcely at all in 2005. Gonadal recrudescence was thus initiated when water temperatures were close to their maximum but declining in Carnarvon, and close to their minima and rising in the Perth and south coast regions, respectively. The prevalence of fully mature and spawning females in all three regions was greatest in those months when water temperatures lay between 19 and 21oC. Collation of the data in this thesis and those provided in the literature for other populations showed that the spawning period was related to latitude, occurring far earlier in sub-tropical than temperate waters.
 
 The females and males attained maturity at a far smaller total length (L50) in the Carnarvon region, i.e. 378 and 353 mm, respectively, than in the Perth region, 585 and 566 mm, respectively, and also the south coast region, i.e. 600 and 586 mm. The trends exhibited by the age at maturity parallel those for length, with the A50s for the two sexes increasing from ca 4 years in Carnarvon to ca 5.6 years in the Perth region and nearly 7 years in the south coast region. The L50 and A50 at maturity thus both increased with increasing latitude.
 
 Marginal increment analysis demonstrated that, irrespective of the number of opaque zones in the otoliths of P. auratus, a single such opaque zone is laid down each year in these otoliths. Furthermore, the trends exhibited by the monthly marginal increments showed that the opaque zone is laid down predominantly in winter in the subtropical waters of Carnarvon, as opposed to mainly in spring in the temperate waters of the Perth and south coast regions. Thus, the timing of formation of the opaque zone in the otoliths of P. auratus along the Western Australian coast is not related to the trends exhibited by water temperature, but, in both the Carnvarvon and Perth regions, was coincident with the timing of spawning.
 
 The maximum total lengths recorded for females and males in the Carnarvon region, i.e. 864 and 840 mm, respectively, were considerably less than the corresponding values of 1051 and 1056 mm in the Perth region, and 1083 and 1099 mm in the south coast region. Growth in the Perth and south coast regions was greater than in Carnarvon, as is reflected in, for example, the respective lengths of 820, 720 and 610 mm for females at 10 years of age, as determined from the von Bertalanffy growth equations.
 
 The length and age compositions in the Carnarvon and south coast regions were essentially unimodal, whereas those in the Perth region were bimodal. However, the 'mode' in the length-frequency distribution for the south coast region was located well to the right of that in the Carnarvon region, reflecting relatively lower contributions by individuals of the age cohorts of 3 to 6 years. The marked bimodality in the length-frequency distribution for P. auratus in the Perth region was due to the presence of a group of mainly smaller individuals caught outside Cockburn Sound and another of mainly larger individuals that were caught in Cockburn Sound and which formed part of a spawning aggregation in that embayment.
 
 The proportion of fish &gt; 10 years old in the Carnarvon region declined markedly between 2003 and the following two years, presumably reflecting the effect of heavy fishing pressure. This contributed to the decision by fisheries managers to reduced the TAC in those waters after 2003. Age-frequency data demonstrated that annual recruitment success in Cockburn Sound varied greatly, with the 1991, 1992 and 1996 year classes being particularly strong, and recognizing that the relative numbers of the first two year classes did decline progressively between 2002 and 2004. Annual recruitment was particularly variable in the south coast region, with the catches of the 1996 year class dominating the samples.
 
 The relative number of early stage P. auratus eggs in ichthyoplankton samples collected from Cockburn sound on each of four new moons during the spawning seasons of four consecutive years peaked in November in three of those years, i.e. 2001, 2003 and 2004, and in November/December in the remaining year, i.e. 2002. This showed that spawning in this embayment peaked during these months, at which times the mean sea surface temperatures ranged only from 19 to 20oC.
 
 The prevalence of spawning fraction females in sequential samples demonstrated that spawning peaks at the new and, to a lesser extent, full moons. This helps account for the strong positive correlation between spawning fraction and tidal regime, with spawning being greatest when the tidal range is greatest.
 
 Spawning times, back-calculated from the ages of the eggs collected during ichthyoplankton surveys in Cockburn Sound on each of 16 new moons within the spawning periods of four successive years, demonstrated that, in this embayment, P. auratus spawns at night and within the first three hours of the onset of the ebb tide. The distribution of egg concentrations on the 16 new moons showed that, each year, spawning occurred firstly in the north-eastern area of Cockburn Sound and then in the middle and finally north-western areas of this embayment.
 
 In the Perth region, the marine embayments of Cockburn and Warnbro Sound act as nursery areas for P. auratus during the first two years of life. The majority of 2 to 5 year old fish and a large proportion of the 6 year old fish occupy the marine waters outside the embayments. The remaining 6 year old and almost all of the older fish begin to move in September into particularly Cockburn Sound, where they form relatively large spawning aggregations between October and December, before undergoing a massive emigration from this embayment in December/January. The limited returns from fish that were tagged in Cockburn Sound and were subsequently caught outside this embayment indicate that, following spawning, P. auratus does not tend to move in a particular direction.
 
 Pagrus auratus stocks are heavily exploited in offshore, oceanic waters and in embayments, such as Cockburn Sound, where they are particularly susceptible to capture because of the tendency of this species to form spawning aggregations in these same easily accessible locations each year. The data obtained during this thesis show that the L50 at maturity of females and males in temperate waters, i.e. nearly 600 mm, is far greater than the current minimum legal length (MLL) of 410 mm TL. There is thus a need to increase the MLL and/or reduce fishing pressure on immature individuals in open waters. However, the effectiveness of an increase in the MLL may be limited because there is evidence that P. auratus suffers from fishing-induced barotrauma. Closures of specific areas during the spawning season of P. auratus, such as those that have been applied in Cockburn Sound and Shark Bay, are potentially a very effective method for reducing the effects of heavy fishing on spawning individuals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/382/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">African cultural education: a dialogue with African migrant youth in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Wakholi, Peter</field><field name="description">African Cultural Education: A dialogue with African migrant youth in Western Australia, examines cultural issues that concern a specific group of African migrant youths. The ten youth participants three of whom are male and seven female share their concerns and desires about issues relating to their cultural identity. As a minority group in a predominantly Eurocentric society they are faced with cultural challenges, which influence their being namely: Racism and the pressure to assimilate.
 
 The thesis adopts an African Centred Cultural Democracy approach: which proposes that African people must construct a 'new' African identity and must begin to perceive and interpret the world in its entirety from an African psychological, spiritual, and cultural frame of reference. This approach requires an ongoing critical assesement of both subjective lived experience and objective conditions. Through the Ujamaa circle process the youth participants along with the facilitator examined challenges to their cultural identities and alternative liberatory options. Growing up in a culturally alienating Eurocentric culture, they felt the need for an African cultural space, in which they could explore issues affecting them as African descendants. In particular racism and assimilation were of major concern to them. They were of the opinion that there should be an ongoing African Cultural Education Program to facilitate cultural re-evaluation and continuity.
 
 It is the study's conclusion that cultural education for a minority African migrant group in a dominant Eurocentric culture is essential for their identities and continued root-cultural connectedness. Within the African Cultural Education conceptual framework, in addition to African cultural re-evaluation, it is possible to critically explore oppressive and domineering practices of the mainstream culture. It is also possible that the African migrant youth may become equipped with alternative worldviews from an African perspective, which will enable him/her to make informed judgement and response towards inappropriate mainstream attitudes and values. Participation in the arena of cultural politics will therefore be based on informed practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/383/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the ovine model of McArdle's disease: development of therapeutic strategies</field><field name="creator">Walker, Kendall Rae</field><field name="description">McArdle's disease (OMIM 232600) is one of the most common glycogen storage diseases affecting skeletal muscle. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a defect in the muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene (PYGM) (Ch 11q13), a key metabolic enzyme. As a result, patients are unable to mobilise muscle glucose stores to provide the energy for muscle contraction; and suffer from exercise intolerance (myalgia, tachycardia, breathlessness and early fatigue) as well as cramps / contractures and occasionally rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria after bouts of strenuous exercise. Histopathologically, McArdle's disease is characterised by an increase in subsarcolemmal storage of glycogen and reduced or absent glycogen phosphorylase activity. McArdle's disease displays significant genetic heterogeneity, with 47 different disease-causing mutations in PYGM having been identified in human sufferers. In keeping with this genetic heterogeneity, significant molecular heterogeneity is observed in patients with regard to the effect of the disease-causing mutation on the PYGM mRNA transcript. In contrast, little biochemical heterogeneity is associated with the disease, with approximately 90% of human patients having no residual pygm protein and therefore no enzyme activity.
 
 A naturally occurring ovine model of McArdle's disease was identified a number of years ago in a flock of merino sheep in Western Australia. The disease causing mutation responsible for ovine McArdle's disease was identified and published in 1997 by Tan et al., (1997) [1]. The mutation occurs in the 3' acceptor splice-site of intron 19 of the ovine PYGM gene, resulting in the activation of a cryptic splice-site site in exon 20 and the premature termination of the transcript. Hypothetically this mutant pygm protein should be 31 amino acids smaller than the wild-type. When I began my PhD, it was known that the ovine sufferers displayed exercise intolerance and histological examination of affected muscle revealed an excess subsarcolemmal storage of glycogen and absent phosphorylase, as occurs in their human counterparts. Due to their similarities in muscle mass to humans and the relative ease and low cost of maintenance, the ovine model of McArdle's disease is an important and highly relevant test-bed for therapeutic strategies. 
 
 This thesis can essentially be divided into two parts:
 1) The characterisation of the ovine model of McArdle's disease-
 In particular, determining the effect of the disease-causing mutation on both the PYGM mRNA and protein, characterising the sequences of the ovine glycogen phosphorylase isoforms and their developmental and tissue specific expression patterns, as well as determining the identity and the activity of the glycogen phosphorylase isoforms expressed in certain muscle groups (cardiac, extraocular and smooth muscles) which appear to be protected from the disease. 
 
 Based upon this data and making use of the ovine model;
 2) Development of therapeutic strategies-
 A number of potential therapeutic strategies were investigated including: 
 * The upregulation of a functionally related gene, through the re-expression of non-muscle isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase via notexin induced muscle regeneration. 
 * As well as the replacement of the PYGM gene using modified adenovirus 5 (AdV5) and adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV-2) vectors. 
 
 Based upon the ability of the non-muscle isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase to function in-vivo in McArdle's muscle in the absence of the muscle isoform, the ability of tributyrin (a butyrate prodrug and potent histone deacetylase inhibitor) to re-express brain glycogen phosphorylase in mature mouse muscle was also investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/384/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Civic environmental pragmatism: a dialogical framework for strategic environmental assessment</field><field name="creator">Wallington, Tabatha Jean</field><field name="description">Questions of uncertainty and value conflict are increasingly pervasive challenges confronting policy makers seeking to address the range of environmental problems generated by contemporary technological systems. Yet these questions are ultimately political and moral in nature, and require a framework of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) that is marked by informed and democratic civic governance. Reflecting this, the original, civic purposes of environmental assessment (EA) embraced science and public participation as interdependent elements in the creation of more sustaining forms of human-nature interaction. 
 
 However, formal models of EA have forsaken meaningful democratic engagement to technique. Based on the instrumentalist assumption that better science automatically leads to better policy, EA has externalised the civic source of political energy that underpins its environmental expertise. Moreover, debates become polarised when science is uncritically imported into the adversarial forums of interest-based politics, so that environmental science is increasingly unable to support political action. I shall argue that the revolutionary potential of SEA to transform the policy process rests upon a recovery of its original, civic purposes. 
 
 My thesis is that a deeper understanding of the relationship between scientific knowledge and political action is required if SEA is to be rigorous, and also relevant to public concerns. Philosophical pragmatism contributes epistemological resources vital to this task. By situating knowledge in the context of practice, and by recognising the dialogical, judgmental nature of rationality, the practical philosophy of pragmatism reclaims the contextually embedded nature of inquiry. When science is embedded in a wider ethical context, the meaning and purposes of environmental knowledge become central questions of policy. 
 
 The procedural ethics of both liberal and Habermasian politics cannot address these questions, however, because they relegate questions of the public good to the realm of individual choice. Instead, I argue that public dialogue, guided by a praxisoriented virtue ethics, is required to recover objective environmental goods in the policy process. I also argue that Aristotlean rhetoric, with its focus on the credibility of expertise, is the mode of persuasive argument most appropriate for dialogical public forums. The public philosophy of civic environmental pragmatism is therefore presented as a richer theoretical framework for understanding the contribution of both experts and citizens in the development of environmental knowledge for policy. As a dialogical framework for SEA, civic environmental pragmatism constructively combines the critical/normative and instrumental/descriptive aspects of policy inquiry, both of which are required in the development of socially robust knowledge and politically feasible policy decisions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/385/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the association between herpesviruses and respiratory disease in racehorses in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Wang, Liping</field><field name="description">Respiratory disease is an important cause of wastage in the Australian horse racing industry and viruses are frequently suspected as aetiological agents of respiratory disease or poor performance by clinicians and trainers but confirmation is seldom attempted. This thesis deals with the potential role of equine herpes virus types 1, 2, 4 and 5 in upper respiratory disease and poor performance in horses in Western Australia.
 
 The methodology selected for the identification of equine herpes viruses in tissues of horses was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and therefore individual PCR assays were developed for the detection of each herpes virus, and then a nested multiplex PCR was developed to detect all four viruses. There was good correlation between the multiplex PCR for the detection of EHV and the detection of virus by isolation in cell culture, although a combination of the 2 techniques provided greater sensitivity than either technique alone. The multiplex PCR described appeared equally sensitive as specific PCR assays using a single set of primers for each individual virus but reduced labour and reagent costs.
 
 As latency is a well recognised phenomenon in the equine herpes viruses and the horse is subjected to a number of stresses which might induce reactivation of latent infections, it was hypothesised that there would be a background level of replication of the equine herpes viruses in clinically normal horses. Nasal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were obtained from 282 clinical normal horses and examined for EHV. The results clearly demonstrated the widespread occurrence of EHV in the clinically healthy horses. The rate of detection of different types of EHV varied, as did the prevalence in young and adult horses. The most common EHV detected was EHV5: in 83.2% of 131 of horses &lt;2 years of age; in 40% of horses &gt;2 years of age.
 
 A prospective clinical study was conducted whereby respiratory tract samples and PBL from adult horses with respiratory disease and/or poor performance were examined for equine herpes viruses; the aim was to determine a possible association between equine herpes virus infection and respiratory disease and/or poor performance. The relative incidence of factors identified in the history, signalment, physical and laboratory evaluation of horses in the study population was compared between horses from which EHV was identified in respiratory samples and horses negative for equine herpes virus. The results indicated that equine herpes viruses were important causes of respiratory disease in the study population, and that haematological and cytological data were a poor indicator of such equine herpes virus infection.
 
 The occurrence of equine herpes virus in nasal swabs and PBL of weaned or unweaned foals from Thoroughbred breeding establishments was determined and provided data on the occurrence of EHV in association with respiratory disease. EHV5 was detected in nasal swabs and/or PBL at a high prevalence rate in healthy foals and yearling horses but its occurrence was not associated with clinical signs of respiratory disease. In contrast, EHV2 was detected more commonly in nasal swabs and/or PBL from foals with respiratory disease than in similar samples from healthy horses. Experimental infection of 8 horses with EHV2 was attempted and induced clinical signs of respiratory disease, but less severe than observed in the epidemiological studies. The results suggested that EHV2 is associated with mild upper respiratory tract infection in young horses.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/386/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The female professor: a rare Australian species, the who and how</field><field name="creator">Ward, Beverley Lorraine</field><field name="description">Although many studies have been made of female academic staff in Australia, there has been no discrete study of Australian female professors as an occupational class or of the relatively rare incumbents of this important position. This thesis makes a contribution to this previously unexplored area by providing a descriptive profile of current professors at Australian universities and an insight into female professors' perspectives on how they managed their entry into the Australian professoriate. It responds to the twin central questions: 'Who are the female occupants in the Australian professoriate and how have they managed their way through the academic hierarchy'?
 
 A profile of current female Australian professors, constructed via a questionnaire, provides the study with a foundation -- a background from which to view the interpretative data. This part of the research also makes a contribution to the social arithmetic of higher education, by presenting systematic demographic information on female professors in Australian universities. Subsequently 13 in-depth interviews were conducted, giving a 'voice' to the professors. This enabled the research to identify and explore six major themes - career, role, significant others, gender, change, and reflection.
 
 The thesis presents the data collected in the questionnaire and interviews, discusses and interprets the research findings, and provides an insight into the milieu in which the female professors function. It includes an overview of some of the critical literature pertinent to the topic - female professors and their working lives - from both an Australian and an international perspective. It also details the methodology used in the study, which included both quantitative and qualitative research tools, and describes the theoretical position which frames the qualitative part of the research, symbolic interactionism, which is located within the hermeneutic/interpretive paradigm in social research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/387/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration, metamorphosis and the residual link: resources of British women to re-invent themselves</field><field name="creator">Ward, Catherine Hall</field><field name="description">Migration can cause disruption to the normal functioning of the family; especially women and mothers. In this study a cross sectional approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies was undertaken to establish the impact of migration on women fiom the United Kingdom (UK) and Eire (N=154) now living in Australia; from these participants 40 were selected for in-depth interview. Women were asked about their experiences of migration and the strategies used to 'settle' in a new country. The researcher postulated that the process of settlement requires a reinvention of the self through building new perceptions of culture, country, friends, and family and the re-definition of the self in relation to these aspects of the environment. A conceptual model was developed and used to determine and examine the relationships amongst who and what influenced the decision and motivation to migrate, the impact of exposure to a new culture, assault on the old identity and the possible grieving response to the impact of multiple loss (loss of home, major attachment figure, family, community, culture and social networks).
 
 Bowlby's attachment theory and grieving process was used as a theoretical framework for the study. Data analysis inQcated that the majority of the women experienced at least some of the characteristics associated with the stages of the grieving process and the time-scale and pathway through the process differed amongst individuals. Women who successfully reached the final stage (reorganisation) of the grieving process were able to re-invent themselves using pre and post-migration strategies (social, cultural and country activities). Participants who were less able in this transformation or re-invention used more solitary strategies. Different levels of a sense of belonging and success in re-inventing the self were linked to the different motivations for migrating. Inability to reach the stage of re-organisation, even after residency of 20 years or more, resulted in negative perceptions of the adopted country and continuing psychological distress. However, even those participants who successfully re-invented themselves continued to foster a residual link to the homeland. This is interpreted to be the result of a form of imprinting. Furthermore, women with newborns or young children identified that the impact of multiple loss, especially loss of a social support system, had a detrimental impact on their childrearing experiences.
 
 The study has implications for future migrants in assisting them to adjust and survive in the new country. It also has implications for health professionals to recognise that all mothers and perhaps especially migrant mothers require a social support network. Further, the health professional needs to be a part of that network and also assist the migrant to develop the appropriate shlls to extend their social support. In addition, immigration and social services and the general population should recognise and provide for the psychological and physical needs of migrants of all origins - English speaking as well as non-English speaking.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/388/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The production of synthetic rutile and by-product iron oxide pigments from ilmenite processing</field><field name="creator">Ward, Christopher</field><field name="description">A study has been carried out on the Becher and Summit Processes with the aim of understanding the mechanism and critical parameters required for the production of a range of pure iron oxide pigments, as well as high quality synthetic rutile from reduced ilmenite.
 
 The Becher Process currently produces a large quantity of worthless mixed phase iron oxides. However, this study has shown that the range of iron oxides formed are all derived from the transformation of lepidocrocite (y-FeOOH) through the solution phase in iron(II) solutions. The results of a kinetic study of the transformation of lepidocrocite found that the rate exhibited an induction period at low pH, was dependent on temperature and was linearly related to log [H+] and log [Fe2+]. The rate determining step was found to be the formation of suitable product nuclei, following dissolution of the initial oxide at the surface of the crystal lattice.
 
 An electrochemical study of these reactions showed that the product formed from the transformation of lepidocrocite was a function of the solution potential and an experimental Eh-pH diagram was constructed to predict the iron oxide phase produced from hydrolysis and transformation reactions. The results from this fundamental study were then applied on both a laboratory and plant scale to produce pure iron oxide phases.
 
 A modified Summit Process, involving the removal of metallic iron from the porous reduced ilmenite matrix using FeCl 3, regeneration of iron(III) and the production of pure iron oxide pigments from the waste iron(II) chloride solution, was also investigated in detail.
 
 A kinetic study of pure iron dissolution in iron(III) solutions, comparing three electrochemical techniques and a standard solution sampling method, gave consistent rate constants provided allowance was made for the reaction with the proton. The iron dissolution mechanism was found to be iron(III) diffusion controlled, while the dissolution in HC1 was under mixed control. A study using both pure iron and pressed reduced ilmenite discs found that acid consumption could be minimised by the addition of citrate or by the addition of A1 3+ or Fe 2+ , which are believed to block the adsorption of the proton. It was found that iron(III)-citrate complexes inhibited iron(II1) hydrolysis in the reduced ilmenite pores and enhanced the purity of the synthetic rutile product.
 
 A study of the oxidation of iron(II) by atmospheric oxygen using copper(II) and activated carbon catalysts found that these catalysts were inefficient for complete iron(III) regeneration. The heating of carbon in the presence of cu2+ was found to enhance the initial rate of iron(II) oxidation, however it is believed that surface oxide redox couples formed on the carbon control the iron(II)/ iron(III) ratio in solution, and prevent complete iron(I1) oxidation. The production of iron oxide pigments under the controlled conditions afforded by the Summit Process, resulted in superior quality pigments than are presently attainable from the Becher Process. However, controlled ageing and crystal growth using waste lepidocrocite from the Becher Process would result in similar quality pigments being produced.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/389/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fulfilment of doom?: the dialogic interaction between the Book of Lamentations and the pre-exilic/early exilic prophetic literature</field><field name="creator">Boase, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">It has long been noted that the book of Lamentations shares, at least in part, a theological outlook with the prophetic literature that the destruction of Jerusalem was the result of Yahweh's decisive action against the sins of the nation.  Too often, however, this relationship has simply been presupposed, or assumed to be a relationship of shared perspective.  To date there has been no systematic exploration of how it is that Lamentations accepts and/or modifies the theological outlook of the prophetic literature.  In addition, when the theology of the prophets has been discussed in relation to Lamentations, there has been a tendency to group all the prophetic books together as if they existed as a homogeneous whole, and shared amongst themselves a singular outlook.  This tendency to simplify the theological complexity of the prophetic literature coincides with a similar tendency to reduce the theology of Lamentations to simple, monolithic assertions.  Drawing on the literary insights of Mikhail Bakhtin, this study aims to explore in detail the nature of the relationship between Lamentations and the pre-exilic/exilic prophetic literature.  Drawing on notions of dialogism, Polyphony and double voicing, the study argues that Lamentations enters i8nto a dialogic relationship with the prophetic literature, a relationship that both affirms and subverts that literature.  Central to the acknowledgement of the dialogic interaction between Lamentations and the prophetic literature is the recognition of Lamentations as a multivalent, polyphonic text in which unmerged viewpoints exist in a tension filled relationship.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/390/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the blink of an eye: an investigation into the concept of the 'decisive moment' (Augenblick) as found in nineteenth and twentieth century western philosophy</field><field name="creator">Ward, Koral</field><field name="description">'In the blink of an eye' is a figurative expression which, in its most basic interpretation describes the experience of a fleeting but momentous event.

The research was conducted at the Wanariset Orang-utan Reintroduction Centre in East Kalirnantan fiom 1994 to 1997, during which time extensive field excursions were made throughout Borneo, and at the Biomedical Primate Research Centre in the Netherlands in 1998.
 
 Analysis of clinical records fiom 1991 to 1997 showed that during this period 339 orang-utans were admitted to Wanariset, of which 96 (28.3%) died and 108 (31.8%) were released. Studies were designed to identify and determine the prevalence of diseases, specifically gastro-intestinal parasites, tuberculosis and certain viral diseases. Further studies defined the factors associated with mortalities of orang-utans at the reintroduction centre.
 
 Gastro-intestinal parasites, in particular Strongyloides spp. and Balantidium coli, posed health problems for rehabilitant orang-utans. Strongyloides spp. and Strongyle sp. eggs and B. coli were detected in faecal samples from new arrivals, rehabilitant, released and wild individuals. Trichuris trichura was present in new arrivals, released and rehabilitant orang-utans, whereas Ascaris sp., and Cyclospora sp. were present only in rehabilitants. There was a high prevalence of B. coli in new arrivals (41.6%), rehabilitants (100%) and released individuals (100%) and a low prevalence in wild individuals (12.5%). Faecal egg counts of individuals infected with Strongyloides spp. showed that 47.8% of rehabilitants and 14.3% of new arrivals had egg counts over 1000 eggs/gm, 81.8% of released individuals had egg counts less than 500 eggslgm and all wild individuals had egg counts less than 100 eggs/mg. Strongyloidosis was the primary cause of death (21.9%) of rehabilitant orang-utans, prior to the incorporation of oral ivermectin into the parasite control program.
 
 There was a low prevalence of tuberculosis, which was detected in one individual (0.8%) and suspected to have caused the death of two others (2.1% of deaths). Diagnosis of tuberculosis in orang-utans was complicated by inaccuracies and difficulties in interpreting the diagnostic tests commonly used in humans and nonhuman primates. Further research is required to develop more reliable and accurate tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in orang-utans.
 
 A study of the serological prevalence of a number of viral infections in captive orangutans showed evidence of exposure to hepatitis B virus (42.6%), hepatitis A virus (34.9%), herpes simplex viruses (14.7%), simian D-type retroviruses (11.2%) and human T-lymphotrogic viruses (1.4%). There was no evidence of exposure to simian or human immunodeficiency viruses.
 
 Molecular studies to determine the origin of the hepatitis B virus, showed the virus was not of human origin as has been generally assumed, but was an indigenous virus which also occurred naturally in wild populations. The virus was subsequently named Orangutan Hepadnavirus.
 
 A molecular study using mitochondrial DNA was undertaken to determine whether there was significant genetic diversity between six isolated populations of wild orangutans within Borneo. It was concluded that there are at least four genetically distinct populations located in East Kalimantan, southwest Kalirnantdcentral Kalirnantan, northwest KalimantdSarawak, and Sabah.
 
 The findings of this research are discussed in terms of the implications for management policies for reintroduction centres, as well as for the conservation of wild populations. They will also be of relevance to zoos and primate centres.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/392/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limits of feminism</field><field name="creator">Wasley, Sasha Darlene</field><field name="description">What is it about feminism that invites so many different opinions on what 'counts' and what doesn't? People from vastly different cultural situations variously categorise feminist practices as extreme, radical, reactionary, unbalanced, co-opted, revolutionary, elite, exclusive, progressive, passe, and hysterical. The desire of both feminists and anti-feminists to control feminism emerges as the limiting of what feminism is, whom it is for, and where it is going. The urge to limit feminism seems, in some cases, to overtake the urge to spread the word and celebrate feminism's successes. And it is not just anti-feminists who attempt to limit feminism - even feminists spend an inordinate amount of time defining certain practices out of the feminist spectrum. In this thesis, I document and analyse the way we limit feminism - its participants, meaning, practices, language, history, and future. I explore the reasons why we need to contain feminism in this way, looking in particular at those who have an investment in keeping feminism comfortably small. I invite back into the realm of feminism a wide range of activities and theories we generally invalidate as feminism, including the words of several 'unofficial' feminists I interviewed for this project. In essence, this project goes towards the rethinking of the term 'feminism' by examining the widely differing and often contradictory definitions of 'what counts.'</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/393/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Hardenbergia mosaic virus and development of microarrays for detecting viruses in plants</field><field name="creator">Webster, Craig Graham</field><field name="description">A virus causing chlorosis and leaf distortion in the Western Australian endemic legume Hardenbergia comptoniana was detected by biological indexing to Chenopodium quinoa and Nicotiana benthamiana.  Enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using general Potyvirus antiserum and amplification by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers indicated that it was a species of Potyvirus. It was confirmed as an unknown member of the genus Potyvirus by comparing its coat protein sequence with those of other potyviruses.  The name Hardenbergia mosaic virus (HarMV) is proposed for this new virus species.  Isolates of HarMV were collected from 13 sites, covering much of the natural range of its host. An experimental host range was determined using nine virus isolates tested against plants from 11 species in three families.  Its infectivity on three leguminous species important in agriculture (Lupinus angustifolius, L. luteus and Trifolium subterraneum) was established.
 
 The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the coat proteins (CP) of 28 isolates determined there was 24.1- 27.6% diversity with the closest known relative, Passion fruit woodiness virus (PWV). Studies of the nucleotide sequences of the CP showed that there was considerable intra-species divergence (mean 13.5%, maximum 20.5%) despite its relatively small geographical distribution and single known natural host. The observed broad diversity strongly suggests long genetic isolation and that HarMV evolved in the region where it was collected.  An examination of its phylogeny showed that 28 isolates clustered into eight clades with high bootstrap support (6.2-20.5% inter-clade diversity).  Isolates collected at locations distant to the Perth metropolitan area (Margaret River and Seabird) diverged more from isolates collected in the metropolitan area (15.4-21.1% nucleotide sequence diversity).  This virus represents the first endemic species to be characterised from Western Australia.
 
 Differences in pathogenicity and symptoms induced on key host species were seen between isolates belonging to different phylogenetic clades.  Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the inclusion of HarMV within the Bean common mosaic virus group of the potyviruses and also defined a previously unreported subgroup of six previously described Potyvirus species (Clitoria virus Y, Hibbertia virus Y, PWV, Siratro 1 virus Y, and Siratro 2 virus Y), from Australia, which is further evidence for a prolonged period of genetic isolation.
 
 Both in relation to detection of strains of HarMV, and considering the broader issues of biosecurity and parallel detection of plant viruses, a microarray based detection system was established.  To optimise conditions for the development of microarrays for virus detection poly-L-lysine (PLL) coated microscope slides produced in the laboratory were compared to commercially produced PowerMatrix slides (Full Moon BioSystems). Variables tested for PLL slide production were: choice of printing buffer, probe concentration, method of immobilisation and slide blocking; and in particular the print buffer and immobilisation method had the greatest effect on the quality of PLL microarray slides.  Slides printed on PLL surfaces in a high salt buffer (3x Saline sodium citrate) supplemented with 1.5M betaine and immobilised at 42oC overnight retained the highest amounts of probe DNA of the methods tested.  Qualitative comparisons of the two showed more probe was retained on PowerMatrix slides which were also more reliable and consistent than the PLL slides.
 
 Probes were designed for eight different virus species and six distinct strains of HarMV to test the potential to use microarrays to distinguish between them. Probes were designed to detect potyviruses at the genus, species and strain levels. Although there was evidence of non-specific hybridisation, the Potyvirus array was used to identify six strains of HarMV by hybridisation to species specific probes.  Additionally the array was used to identify three other species of Potyvirus: Bean yellow mosaic virus, PWV and Passiflora foetida virus Y, following amplification with polyvalent PCR primers.
 
 In further microarray tests, using labelled first strand cDNA of Potato virus X (PVX) and Potato virus Y (PVY) on an array, PVX was strongly detected in leaves known to be infected, but PVY was only weakly detected in infected leaves.  Three methods of pre-amplification of virus nucleic acid before hybridisation to the array were investigated to improve the sensitivity of the assay.  Two of the methods, Klenow amplification and randomly primed PCR, amplified the target virus; as confirmed by real time PCR.  Of the methods tested only randomly primed PCR improved the sensitivity of the microarray.  The best amplification method used genus-specific primers with adaptor sequences.  This method when tested by real time PCR showed a 3.7Ct reduction for PVX and 16.8Ct for PVY.  The microarray correctly identified both viruses.
 
 In this work the first virus (HarMV) endemic to Western Australia was identified, and microarray methods were developed both to identify HarMV and other plant viruses of economic importance.  The microarray approach, with further development, may be applicable as a means of identifying incursions of new viruses in a biosecurity situation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/394/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of professional culture on dispute resolution in the building industries of Australia and Sri-Lanka</field><field name="creator">Weddikkara, Chitra</field><field name="description">The construction industry poses a number of challenges to those working in it. One important challenge is that the industry is dependent upon human interactions in the management of building projects. In this environment it is important for those who manage the projects to deal with intricate relationships and to consider the emotions, interactions and various types of reasoning that lie behind the actions and decisions taken by the participants in the construction process.
 
 The issue for researchers is to gain a better understanding of the variables that affect the actions of the participants in this process. Such research demands sensitivity to the values, attitudes and behavior developed by the different occupational groupings. These factors according to Edgar Schein define the culture of a professional group. This research was conceived on the belief that the professionals in the construction industry brought to bear their own professional culture on the industry. It was necessary to have a better understanding of this culture in order to be able to resolve disputes that occur in the construction process. 
 
 That is the impact of culturally deternlined values, attitudes and behavior of these professional groups. Therefore, this research is aimed at investigating the professional cultures of the participants who come together in a construction project. The question posed was whether they shared a culture or had differences, and if differences existed whetherthese differences had an effect on the reactions of each of the groups to disputes and their resolution.
 
 A survey was carried out among professional groups in Australia and Sri-Lanka and the survey data from both countries were analyzed using statistical tests. The results show that professional groups share similarities in professional culture as well as differences. It also showed that these cultural differences created an adversarial atmosphere among construction project participants. It was also found that introducing a party outside of the usual professional groups would be beneficial in the resolution process. Respondents were of the opinion that the third party outside of the construction team could be a lawyer.
 
 This type of research is still new within the field of construction. The contributions of this work are to link professional culture and conflict and give some indication how such conflict could be addressed. In this context by identifying the values attitudes and behavior of professional groups the subject of conflict and disputes could be beneficially addressed through professional education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/395/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships with many facets: unpacking the interactions between protected area managers and commercial tour operators</field><field name="creator">Wegner, Agathe</field><field name="description">For protected areas worldwide, commercial tour operators are increasingly providing the services and products desired and needed by visitors to these areas. Given the engagement of both protected area managers and tour operators in protected areas, and inevitably with each other, it is critical that their relationship and its complexities are clearly understood. As such, the interests of managers and operators overlap insofar as that they work in the same locales, share some of the burden of service provision, and aim to offer a quality product. However, this study shows that they diverge in other ways, particularly given the commercial imperative that necessarily strongly influences the activities of their business, irrespective of its location. This thesis seeks to unpack the complexities of a relationship that is critically important both in terms of the quality of the tourism experiences offered by protected areas, and the conservation of such areas in the longer term. In order to obtain an understanding of the complexity of the interactions between protected area managers and tour operators, qualitative research methods were used, in which in-depth interviews provided a rich picture of the important diverse aspects and facets impacting on their relationships. This study found that both managers and operators considered the purpose of protected areas to be the conservation of biodiversity and their recreational use and enjoyment. Surprisingly, their similar values were unknown to them. A major influence on their relationships was their perceptions of power, with 'dominant' power largely based on legislative and regulatory mandates, perceived to rest with the protected area managers. In contrast, this study also found evidence of 'resistant' power. This form of Foucauldian power was held particularly by operators in one geographic locale, and was associated with the concepts of cultural groupings and groupthink. The underlying public policy context influenced the effectiveness of the collaborative efforts of managers and operators. Interwoven with these differences were variable expectations regarding the nature and purpose of communication and what collaboration might 'mean'. These findings importantly suggest several future directions for both practice and research. First, managers and operators share values and hold both similar and different expectations and perceptions, similarities and differences which are significant. Secondly, understanding the importance of power and how it is exercised is critical if successful relationships between managers and operators are to be fostered. Finally, further unpackaging of the meaning of communication and collaboration for managers and operators, a process initiated in this study, is essential if relationships between these groups involved in conservation and recreation in protected areas are to be improved. Therefore, this study suggests that their collaboration can be enhanced at individual, organisational/locale and policy levels, by adopting and implementing an action research framework.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/396/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Democracy and political economy of genetic engineering</field><field name="creator">Weston, Delys Eleanor</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to provide a more critical framework for the assessment of future technologies and therefore social directions and to help to bring an understanding to the relationship between global political economy, corporate power, ideology, science and technology. This is essential given the many issues facing contemporary society - issues of sustainability and humanity's place in the broad ecology, of the need for a diversity of economies, societies and cultures, of the need for greater economic equality and equity across the globe. 
 
 The relationship between globalisation, science and technology, democratic governance and citizens is explored using the case of genetic engineering technologies. The thesis draws on a conceptual framework provided by the theory of political economy to facilitate the assessment of the impact of a technology on society. It provides a critical framework for looking at individualised, sectoral and short term interests versus the often conflicting interests of what is termed the 'common good'. The juxtaposition of the neo-liberal, conservative and contemporarily dominant world view with that of the more radical, political economy stance exposes the tension between these two ways of viewing human history and the future of humankind.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/397/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive and molecular biology of Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Smith</field><field name="creator">Wheeler, Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis examined aspects of the reproductive and molecular biology of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah). The aims were to develop protocols for controlled pollination, that could be used in clonal orchard trees to breed jarrah seedlings that have a known genetic resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi (dieback), for use in rehabilitation after mining and logging. An intimate knowledge of the breeding biology of jarrah was necessary to achieve this aim. The project also aimed to increase knowledge of the genetic diversity and structure of jarrah, in order to make informed decisions regarding the collection of material to be used for clonal propagation. Previous research has had little success in producing viable seed from any controlled pollinations, but clonal material resistant to P. cinnamomi has been produced using tissue culture. The question posed in this thesis was 'Can we improve breeding and propagation techniques of jarrah?' 
 
 Techniques were developed for testing of in vitro pollen viability and pollen storage, pollination and fertilisation success after controlled pollinations, including determination of stigma receptivity and development of bud isolation techniques using alfoil. The variation in female fertility between genotypes was examined. The use of paclobutrazol was explored as a method of increasing the level of viable seed production in clonal orchard trees. The use of fertiliser as well as the growth retardant was also explored to see if it increased the level of seed production even more. Genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and phylogeny within Eucalyptus marginata were examined using nuclear and chloroplast DNA analysis with Restricted Fragment Length Polymorphisms. 
 
 While it was first thought that the fertilisation rate was quite low, it was confirmed that the fertilisation rate is similar to other eucalypt species. The zygote abortion rate was quite high in one clone, but one wild tree had a similar seed production rate to other eucalypt species. The zygote and endosperm appeared to be different in the clone and the wild tree observed. The level of seed production was examined in clones and wild trees and it was found that the level was often quite low, particularly in the clones (0 - 13% in clones, 0 - 18% in wild trees) in comparison with other Eucalyptus species, and varied between genotypes. The use of a growth retardant such as paclobutrazol may increase the production of viable seed, if it is applied during autumn. The results were inconclusive for the fertiliser/paclobutrazol experiment, since the paclobutrazol was applied during spring which was the worst time of year for increasing seed production. There were differences between genotypes in reaction to both the paclobutrazol and the fertiliser/paclobutrazol. Genetic diversity was moderate in comparison with other Eucalyptus species, and there was a low level of genetic differentiation between populations in the nuclear genome. No differentiation was observed between the morphologically recognised subspecies in the nuclear genome, but differentiation between the populations on the Swan Coastal Plain and populations on the Darling Plateau was seen in the chloroplast genome, indicating that there was historical separation of these two areas.
 
 The conclusions arising from this work are that while controlled pollinations are possible in Eucalyptus marginata the clones that were used in these experiments have often behaved differently to the wild trees in the time of anthesis and levels of viable seed production, and in one clone (5J119) the zygote and endosperm nuclei appeared to be very different to the zygote and endosperm nuclei of a wild tree. Further investigation is necessary to see if these differences are related to the low level of seed production observed in the clonal populations. Paclobutrazol may be worth exploring further as a means of increasing seed production. Material to be used for rehabilitation and seed orchards can be collected from a wide area in the main distribution of the species, although trees on the Swan Coastal Plain are distinct from the trees in the main forest area in the chloroplast genome.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/398/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial CaCO3 precipitation for the production of biocement</field><field name="creator">Whiffin, Victoria S.</field><field name="description">The hydrolysis of urea by the widely distributed enzyme urease is special in that it is one of the few biologically occurring reactions that can generate carbonate ions without an associated production of protons. When this hydrolysis occurs in a calcium-rich environment, calcite (calcium carbonate) precipitates from solution forming a solid-crystalline material. The binding strength of the precipitated crystals is highly dependent on the rate of carbonate formation and under suitable conditions it is possible to control the reaction to generate hard binding calcite cement (or Biocement). The objective of this thesis was to develop an industrially suitable cost-effective microbial process for the production of urease active cells and investigate the potential for urease active cells to act as a catalyst for the production of Biocement.
 
 The biocementation capability of two suitable strains was compared. Sporosarcina pasteurii (formally Bacillus pasteurii) produced significantly higher levels of urease activity compared to Proteus vulgaris, however the level of urease activity was variable with respect to biomass suggesting that the enzyme was not constitutive as indicated by the literature, but subject to regulation. The environmental and physiological conditions for maximum urease activity in S. pasteurii were investigated and it was found that the potential urease capacity of the organism was very high (29 mM urea.min-1.OD-1) and sufficient for biocementation without additional processing (e.g. concentration, cell lysis). The regulation mechanism for S. pasteurii urease was not fully elucidated in this study, however it was shown that low specific urease activity was not due to depletion of urea nor due to the high concentrations of the main reaction product, ammonium. pH conditions were shown to have a regulatory effect on urease but it was evident that another co-regulating mechanism existed. Despite not fully exploiting the urease capability of S. pasteurii, sufficient urease activity to allow direct application of the enzyme without additional processing could still be achieved and the organism was considered suitable for biocementation.
 
 Urease was the most expensive component of the cementation process and cost-efficient production was desired, thus an economic growth procedure was developed for large-scale cultivation of S. pasteurii. The organism is a moderate alkaliphile (growth optimum pH 9.25) and it was shown that sufficient activity for biocementation could be cultivated in non-sterile conditions with a minimum of upstream and downstream processing. The cultivation medium was economised and expensive components were replace with a food-grade protein source and acetate, which lowered production costs by 95%. A high level of urease activity (21 mM urea hydrolysed.min-1) was produced in the new medium at a low cost ($0.20 (AUD) per L).
 
 The performance of urease in whole S. pasteurii cells was evaluated under biocementation conditions (i.e. presence of high concentrations of urea, Ca2+, NH4 +/NH3, NO3 - and Cl- ions). It was established that the rate of urea hydrolysis was not constant during cementation, but largely controlled by the external concentrations of urea and calcium, which constantly changed during cementation due to precipitation of solid calcium carbonate from the system. A simple model was generated that predicted the change in urea hydrolysis rate over the course of cementation. It was shown that whole cell S. pasteurii urease was tolerant to concentrations of up to 3 M urea and 2 M calcium, and the rate of urea hydrolysis was unaffected up to by 3 M ammonium. This allowed the controlled precipitation of up to 1.5 M CaCO3 within one treatment, and indicated that the enzyme was very stable inspite of extreme chemical conditions.
 
 A cost-efficient cementation procedure for the production of high cementation strength was developed. Several biocementation trials were conducted into order to optimise the imparted cementation strength by determining the effect of urea hydrolysis rate on the development of strength. It was shown that high cementation strength was produced at low urea hydrolysis rates and that the development of cementation strength was not linear over the course of the reaction but mostly occurred in the first few hours of the reaction. In addition, the whole cell bacterial enzyme had capacity to be immobilised in the cementation material and re-used to subsequent applications, offering a significant cost-saving to the process.
 
 An industry-sponsored trial was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of Biocement for increasing in-situ strength and stiffness of two different sandy soils; (a) Koolschijn sand and (b) 90% Koolschijn sand mixed with 10% peat (Holland Veen). After biocementation treatment, Koolschijn sand indicated a shear strength of 1.8 MPa and a stiffness of 250 MPa, which represents an 8-fold and 3-fold respective improvement in strength compared to unconsolidated sand. Significantly lower strength improvements were observed in sand mixed with peat.
 
 In combination, trials of producing bacteria under economically acceptable conditions and cementation trials support the possibility of on-site production and in-situ application of large field applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/399/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asylum</field><field name="creator">Whish-Wilson, David</field><field name="description">This work consists of a Creative Work, Exegesis and a Bibliography.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/400/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why circus works: how the values and structures of circus make it a significant developmental experience for young people</field><field name="creator">Bolton, Reginald</field><field name="description">Circus is increasingly being used as a developmental and remedial activity for children. However, it is in the paradoxical nature of circus that it operates in a way both mysterious and easily accessible. This thesis proposes that circus as education is more effective when both teacher and student have a better understanding of circus as an art form.
 
 To explain this I first introduce six 'elements' of childhood, whose absence often seems to result in an incomplete personal maturity. I then conduct a wide exploration of both the real and the imagined circus, showing how these elements occur or are evoked there, and I establish a correspondence or 'homology' between the two entities - childhood and circus. The discoveries shed light on the aesthetic code of circus itself, leading to the conclusion that circus works as an artform because its essential composition recalls profound experiences of childhood. 
 
 I argue that contemporary Western childhood presents unexpected hazards, mostly involving passivity and over-protection. In other parts of the world, and in some Western populations, childhood has other problems, linked to deprivation, exploitation and physical danger. In either case, a child involved in circus activities has a chance to make good some deficits, by experiencing constructive physical risk, aspiration, trust, fun, self-individuation and hard work. My hope is that this dissertation will contribute some strength to the case for well-designed programmes of circus activities for young people, in both formal and informal settings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/401/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology of elasmobranchs in a subtropical embayment in Western Australia and of chondrichthyan fisheries in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">White, William Toby</field><field name="description">The first aim of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that the spatial and food resources in the nearshore waters of a subtropical embayment in Western Australia (Shark Bay) will be partitioned within and amongst the main elasmobranch species that occur in that large water body. The size and age compositions, growth rates and reproductive biology of females and males of the nervous shark Carcharhinus cautus in Shark Bay were then determined to better understand the mode of life of this abundant species in this embayment. The second aim was to determine the species and size compositions of chondrichthyans landed by fisheries employing different methods in south-eastern Indonesia. The implications of these data for management were next determined and aspects of the reproductive biology of the most abundant of those species were explored, in a very preliminary manner. 
 
 The nearshore, shallow waters of Shark Bay are used as a nursery area by several shark species and the different habitats in those waters are partitioned, to a certain degree, amongst those species. Ten species of shark (5 families), five species of ray (4 families) and twelve species of teleost (10 families) were caught in those waters. Carcharhinus cautus was the most abundant species, contributing 59.9% to the total number of elasmobranchs and 42.3% to all fish caught. This species and Negaprion acutidens were collected mainly or entirely from unvegetated sites, whereas Rhizoprionodon acutus, Carcharhinus brevipinna and Chiloscyllium punctatum were caught largely or exclusively at the seagrass site. The number of elasmobranch species and number of individuals of elasmobranchs were greatest in the seagrass site and least in the unvegetated site where no vegetation was present nearby, and they were significantly less in the latter site than in the one where dense mangroves were present nearby. These two biotic variables were also significantly greater in summer and autumn than in winter when temperatures were lowest. The species composition of elasmobranchs in each habitat type almost invariably differed significantly from that in each of the other habitat types and there was evidence that the species composition of elasmobranchs varied in a similar seasonal manner at the three unvegetated sites. Carcharhinus cautus, and probably also Hemigaleus microstoma and Chiloscyllium punctatum, were the only species that completed their life cycles in the nearshore, shallow waters of Herald Bight. However, the capture of the juveniles of a further four species with umbilical scars emphasises the importance of these waters as a nursery habitat for shark species.
 
 The dietary compositions of one ray species (Rhinobatus typus) and three shark species (Carcharhinus cautus, Negaprion acutidens, Rhizoprionodon acutus) undergo size-related changes and differ among these species, thereby reducing the potential for competition for food within and among these four species. Rhinobatus typus fed almost exclusively on penaeid prawns and portunid crabs, which is reflected in its narrow dietary breadth, whereas different species of teleosts constituted a major component of the diets of each size class of the three shark species. The relative contributions of the different species of teleost to the diets of the three shark species varied. The variations in dietary composition among the four species reflect differences in behaviour, modes of feeding and relative mouth sizes.
 
 Carcharhinus cautus copulates in late October-early November, shortly followed by ovulation (and thus conception) and parturition occurs about 11 months later. The reproductive cycle of C. cautus is biennial. Female and male C. cautus reached ca 28 and 32% of their lengths at their maximum observed ages, respectively, at the time of parturition. Females and males of C. cautus attained maximum total lengths of 1330 and 1110 mm, respectively, and maximum ages after parturition of 16 and 12 years, respectively. Maturity was attained at about 1010 mm by females and 910 mm by males and at least 50% of females and males had become mature by the end of their sixth and fourth years of life, respectively. The three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth curves provided reasonably good fits to the lengths at age of females and males of C. cautus during just postnatal life and throughout the whole of pre- and postnatal life. However, the four-parameter Schnute growth curve significantly improved the fit to these data for both females and males from conception and for females from birth. The question of when, from a biological view point, it might be appropriate to switch from using a von Bertalanffy growth curve to the more complex Schnute growth curve are discussed.
 
 A total of 139 chondrichthyan species, comprising 77 species of shark representing 17 families, 61 species of ray representing 11 families and a single species of holocephalan, were recorded at the ten landing sites surveyed in south-eastern Indonesia. However, it should be recognised that up to 49 of the 139 chondrichthyan species recorded have apparently not yet been described and thus assigned a species name. The most speciose and commonly recorded families were the Dasyatidae and Carcharhinidae, which collectively contributed 84.8%, respectively, to the total number of individuals of all species. The use of MDS ordination demonstrated that the species compositions at the eight main landing sites reflected to a greater extent the fishing methods used rather than the geographical location of those sites. Data on the reproductive biology of males demonstrated that a number of elasmobranch species were fished prior to the time that they attained maturity. 
 
 The three most abundant chondrichthyan species that were caught both as juveniles and adults were Dasyatis kuhlii, Dasyatis zugei and Himantura walga. Since the reproductive cycle of each of these species did not follow a seasonal pattern, the timing of conception and parturition and the duration of gestation of these species could not be determined. The fecundity of these three species was very low, i.e. maximum of two but usually only a single embryo. The size at maturity of the three species, using data on the prevalence of mature fish, ranged from minima of 163 mm for females and males of H. walga to maxima of 237 mm for females and 239 mm for males of D. kuhlii. The translucent zones on the vertebral centra of D. kuhlii were apparently deposited annually and were thus used to estimate the ages of the individuals of this species. The maximum estimated ages of female and male D. kuhlii were 15 and 10 years, respectively.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/402/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autocatalyst-derived platinum group elements in the roadside environment - occurence, mobility and fate</field><field name="creator">Whiteley, Jason D.</field><field name="description">The emission of the platinum group elements Pt, Pd and Rh (PGE) from automobile catalytic converters has led to rapid increases in Pt, Pd and Rh concentrations in roadside media. The vast majority of previous research examining autocatalyst-derived PGE in the urban environment has been performed in Europe or North America. Although catalytic converters became mandatory on all new cars sold in Australia from 1986, no prior studies have focussed on urban platinum group element (PGE) concentrations in Australian environments.
 
 In general, the results of previous studies suggest a limited post depositional mobility of catalyst derived PGE. However, these findings are from research conducted in cool-temperate climate zones with regular rainfall and from environments where soils and sediments differ from the typically coarse grained, sandy soils with low levels of organic matter found in Perth. The relevance of European and North American findings to other regions with different climates and soils is therefore unclear and where the climate regime and properties of soils and sediments are not comparable to those previously studied, the potential exists for different geochemical behaviour of autocatalyst-derived PGE. Through investigations of spatial and temporal distribution and the identification of some of the main factors controlling transport and fixation, the principal aim of the research presented in this thesis was to elucidate aspects of the post depositional geochemical behaviour of autocatalyst derived PGE in selected roadside environments in Perth, Western Australia.
 
 The quality of some of the reported PGE data has been questioned by a number of workers. Possibly the most intractable diffculty in the determination of low concentrations of PGE in environmental samples by ICP-MS is the control of interferences from common matrix components. To ensure accurate and reliable data in this research, prior to the analysis of environmental samples, the optimal instrumental conditions for PGE determination and two commonly applied matrix separation methodologies (tellurium coprecipitation and ion-exchange) were investigated. The most effective matrix separation technique for the accurate determination of PGE in the environmental samples applicable to this study, such as road dusts and roadside soils, was found to be cation exchange.
 
 The lack of knowledge regarding urban PGE concentrations in an Australian context was addressed through examinations of PGE levels in road dusts, roadside soils and infiltration basin and wetland sediments. Data show significant elevation of all three PGE above local background and average upper crust values. PGE ratios in surface road dusts and soils were consistent with known catalytic converter compositions and while Pt and Rh concentrations are comparable with European studies, Pd levels were generally higher in these Australian samples.
 
 The effect of climate on PGE levels in roadside environments was investigated by repeat sampling of road dusts and roadside soils over a twelve month period. Both sample media exhibited seasonal variations. The presence of seasonal variability in PGE concentrations in roadside soils suggests that this environmental compartment does not represent a long term accumulative matrix for autocatalyst-derived PGE. Further examination of spatial distribution revealed that the PGE exhibit greater vertical mobility in the soils of Perth than has previously been reported, with elevations above local background concentrations occurring at depths of 14-20cm. Neither small scale spatial variability nor vertical mobilisation were of sufficient magnitude to explain the observed temporal variability. Based on the pattern of seasonal PGE distribution and that of rainfall, temporal fluctuations are attributed to transport by stormwater. The mobilisation of PGE by stormwater is thought to occur principally via the water-mediated transport of PGE bearing particulates. However, PGE fractionation leading to a greater post-depositional mobility of Pd may occur during transport through the urban stormwater system.
 
 In the urban environment of Perth, infiltration basin and wetland sediments represent a sink for autocatalyst-derived PGE. Based on the examination of PGE ratios, and the vertical distribution of PGE in infiltration basin sediments, Pt and Rh remain associated, whereas Pd may be differentially mobilised. For both soils and infiltration basin sediments, variation in pH was limited and does not show any correlation with vertical profiles of PGE, suggesting that pH does not act as a major control on PGE mobility. The role of organic matter is less clear, and although no straightforward relationships were apparent, where high levels of organic matter were present, profiles suggest an increased mobilisation of Pd. This differential mobilisation of Pd may therefore be caused by the formation of an organo-metallic species.
 
 Temporal fluctuations in PGE levels in road dusts and roadside soils indicate that inputs of PGE to aquatic environments are likely to occur as seasonal pulses. The routing of road runoff into urban wetlands therefore represents a major pathway by which aquatic ecosystems may be exposed to autocatalyst-derived PGE. The impact of such inputs is unclear, however, as other recent studies have shown that a portion of autocatalyst-derived PGE, and especially Pd is bioavailable, the potential for ecosystem degradation due to PGE contamination represents a major avenue for further research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/403/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The making of a precarious bourgeoisie: state and the transformation of domestic bourgeoisie in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Widihandojo, David</field><field name="description">This study focusses on the dynamics which underlie the changing relationships between Chinese and pribumi business interests and the state. Under the Colonial state, the indigenous bourgeoisie had been practically eliminated, not only by the Dutch but also by priyayi bureaucrats. Consequently, Indonesia inherited a socially and politically weak bourgeoisie dominated by the Chinese who controlled substantial commercial networks, but had limited potential for political organisation. In the post-colonial era, attempts to build an indigenous bourgeoisie failed and it was the state that assumed the leading role in the economy.
 
 Under the New Order Government, the Chinese were to play a central role in promoting rapid economic growth and industrialisation. While this intensified resentment in some areas, new relationships between Chinese and pribumi capital and the state emerged. The intensifying relationship with the Chinese and pribumi had been built primarily around business alliances between large Chinese companies and companies owned by powerful political families. As such, cooperation remain highly dependent upon protective policies and access to monopolies.
 
 The unleashing of economic liberalisation resulted in the maturation of the bourgeoisie, characterised by their increasing entry into the international market. Conflict within business continued to evolve around the issues of conglomerates and was largely racially based. However, other factions were to emerge between upstream and downstream producers, between trading monopolists and producers.
 
 The case studies in this thesis draw out the increasing complexity of pribumi-Chinese relations. In the case of cloves we find that conflict between a Chinese cigarette manufacturing conglomerate and apribumi trading monopolist had few racial aspects. Rather, it was a conflict between rent-seekers and producers that was reflected in other parts of the economy and included both pribumi and Chinese on either side. As the economy grew and capitalism matured, issues other than race became important. These included deregulation of trade and investment, regulation and macro policy, with Pribumi and Chinese becoming absorbed and integrated on either side of the various conflicts.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/404/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Canine zoonoses in Aboriginal communities: the effects of a canine breeding program in the Kimberley Region, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Wilks, Kathryn</field><field name="description">The hypothesis central to this study is that the implementation of a canine breeding and parasite control program in Aboriginal communities results in a reduction in the reservoir of zoonotic parasites within communities. The effect of the parasite and breeding control program on the health status of dogs as well as the population characteristics of dogs in communities was also investigated.
 
 The study was conducted in 17 Aboriginal communities of the Kimberley region of Western Australia, divided into three regions according to cultural and geographical attributes. All dogs from each community were permanently identified using a microchip system. Owners of dogs were asked the usual location of their animals, the origins of their dogs and the whereabouts of any missing animals at subsequent visits. Every three months dogs were treated with 200ygikg iverrnectin (a potent endo- and ecto-parasiticide) subcutaneously and adult female dogs were treated with an injectable contraceptive (10-30mgkg proligestone) at the request of their owners. At the time of treatment, dogs were assessed for ecto-parasites and photographs taken for later comparison and diagnosis of alopecic skin conditions. Faecal and blood samples were collected every three to six months and skin scrapings were collected from dogs that were refractory to treatment. The samples were used to determine internal parasite prevalence (using formal ethyl acetate sedimentation), blood parameters (for anaemia status) and evidence of scabies or Demodex infestation.
 
 A pilot study at one group of communities, involving weekly assessment of dogs after one iverrnectin treatment, showed that the treatment was effective in reducing the prevalence of scabies (as determined by clinical evaluation), hookworm and ticks. The treatment resulted in improvement in animal health as evidenced by a reduction in the number of dogs with anaemia.
 
 The long-term use of the ivermectin treatments at the other communities showed that over a period of three years, the prevalence of scabies and hookworm had reduced at most areas. The initial scabies prevalence varied from 17 to 52% and reduced to below 10% for all communities. The hookworm infection rates were affected by seasonal factors, as was evidenced by a seasonal variance in prevalence. Animals that were treated with ivermectin, though, had lower prevalences of hookworm than those that were not.
 
 There was a reasonable compliance rate for contraceptive treatments for female dogs (greater than 60% at each visit) and fewer puppies were born within communities when compared with rates before and after the establishment of the treatment program. High rates of acquisition of puppies from other communities continued to maintain the dog population numbers despite the reduction in breeding within communities.
 
 The dog population was young, biased towards male dogs, and very unstable (almost 50% of dogs died or went missing in a one year period). The rate of dog ownership across the Kimberley varied according to the region investigated and always remained higher or equal to ownership rates at the town centres of the Kimberley Region (as determined by a survey conducted during the study).
 
 Overall the canine parasite and breeding control program resulted in a reduction in scabies and hookworm prevalence in dogs (and hence a reduction in the potential zoonotic transmission), a reduction in dog breeding within communities, an improvement in dog health, and an understanding in the dynamics and health status of dogs within communities.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/405/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dialogic reimagining of a servant's suffering: understanding second Isaiah's servant of Yahweh as a polyphonic hero</field><field name="creator">Williams, David Wyn</field><field name="description">A definitive identification of the Servant figure of Second Isaiah is notoriously difficult, as attested by centuries of conjecture and debate. The interpretive obstacles are profuse: the Servant is addressed as Israel-Jacob, but then spoken of in terms that are not consistent with the nation's experience; in some texts he seems to represent a community, while in others he speaks as an individual; he seems to suffer extreme hardship and persecution, but then is said to experience new life; some of his experiences appear to be historical, while others are best described as idealistic. Further hampering objective interpretations are the pervasive traditional approaches among Christian and Jewish readers, which associate the Servant, equally emphatically, with Jesus or Israel.  
 
 But a primary reason the Servant is so difficult to pin down is rarely considered, and that is that there exists no objective image of the Servant anywhere in Second Isaiah. As a literary character he is constituted entirely by dialogue; that is, by discourse addressed to him, spoken by him, and spoken about him by others in the form of a confession. His actions are never described, and his person is never defined. Scholars have referred to this as his 'fluid' nature, but have lacked the methodological tools for a fuller study of this literary curiosity. 
 
 The ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin speak to this type of characterisation. His 'polyphonic hero' is a fictional character who is constituted by what is spoken to him or her, by what they overhear said concerning them, and by how they make that discourse, and the discourse of the wider world, an aspect of their own self-knowledge. They become known only by the discourse that converges on them, much as the Servant of Second Isaiah is constituted. This thesis develops a reading strategy based on Bakhtin's theory of the polyphonic hero, as well as his broader theories of dialogism. It reimagines the inner discourse of the Servant in order to comprehend him according to the dialogue by which he knows himself, and not according to conventional reading strategies that seek for a fixed, opaque image. In the process it discovers that there are not multiple Servants, which is often posited as a solution to the problem of his fluid nature, but one Servant, Israel-Jacob, whose self-knowledge as the faithful Servant of Yahweh calls empirical Israel to faith in a time of national distress. It concludes that the Servant is present in the collection of Second Isaiah as a 'voice-idea', the embodiment of a theologically critical position that calls many of Israel's theological and ideological presuppositions into question, in order to liberate her for a renewed history as a faithful 'witness' to Yahweh her redeemer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/406/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voluntary environmental and social accounting disclosure practices in the Asia-Pacific region</field><field name="creator">Williams, Shaun Leigh Mitchell</field><field name="description">Through the juxtaposition of political economy theory and an in-depth empirical analysis, this study provides hrther insights into the understanding of variables that explain variations in voluntary environmental and social accounting disclosures (VESAD) across national and regional boundaries. Factors from three classes of Thomas (1991) classification schema, the organizational attribute (organizational size and economic performance), business environment (industry type) and societal variable (culture, political and civil, system, legal system, level of economic development and equity market) categories, were included in this project.
 
 Listed companies' annual reports were surveyed using content analysis and disclosure index from seven countries in the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. The dependent variable, the extent of VESAD information, was measured by four different measurement bases; these were number pages, sentences and words and disclosure index score. Different measurement bases were used to compare and contrast findings from statistical tests to examine if this lead to conflicting or comparable conclusions.
 
 Descriptive and univariate analysis indicated that under all four measurement bases the country of origin was an important determinant of VESAD practices in the Asia-Pacific region. Multiple regression and path analysis showed that organizational size, industry type, culture, political and civil, and legal systems were statistically significant in explaining variations both directly and indirectly. The level of economic development was also found to be of important but only indirectly. It is concluded from these findings that social and political pressures placed on companies by the interaction of these significant variables compel firms to provide VESAD information to meet social expectations and to avoid possible government regulation to preserve their own self interests and survival. Economic performance and equity market factors were of no significant statistical influence.
 
 Empirical results using data measured by the three units of measurement for content analysis were minimal. Differences were . noted however when contrasted against disclosure index scores. It was concluded from these results that content analysis and disclosure indices measured different concepts, the latter measuring largely a subset of the former. The consequence of this finding, is that researchers, when deciding on whether to measure the dependent variable by content analysis or a disclosure index, will need to define more the relevance of the measurement to be adopted to the research question underlying the study. Determination of the unit of analysis to utilize when adopting content analysis is less complicated as each technique provides essentially the same results.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/407/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of inner power: the practice of pencak silat in West Java</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Ian Douglas</field><field name="description">Pencak silat is a form of martial arts indigenous to the Malay derived ethnic groups that populate mainland and island Southeast Asia. Far from being merely a form of selfdefense, pencak silat is a pedagogic method that seeks to embody particular cultural and social ideals within the body of the practitioner. The history, culture and practice ofpencak in West Java is the subject of this study.
 
 As a form of traditional education, a performance art, a component of ritual and community celebrations, a practical form of self-defense, a path to spiritual enlightenment, and more recently as a national and international sport, pencak silat is in many respects unique. It is both an integrative and diverse cultural practice that articulates a holistic perspective on the world centering upon the importance of the body as a psychosomatic whole.
 
 Changing socio-cultural conditions in Indonesia have produced new forms of pencak silat. Increasing government intervention in pencak silat throughout the New Order period has led to the development of nationalized versions that seek to inculcate state-approved values within the body of the practitioner. Pencak silat groups have also been mobilized for the purpose of pursuing political aims. Some practitioners have responded by looking inwards, outlining a path to self-realization framed by the powers, flows and desires found within the body itself. Others have developed styles that reflect the demands made upon them by their immediate environment.
 
 Viewed historically these changes in the practice of pencak silat provides insights into the impact of broader processes of social and cultural change at the level of individual bodies and the institutions through which they are constructed; a politics of the body, its potentialities, limits and 'legitimate' use.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of L2 methods in atomic scattering</field><field name="creator">Winata, Toto</field><field name="description">An L2 expansion of Yamani and Reinhardt [I975] which employs non-orthogonal, square integrable functions of Laguerre type is used to approximate Coulomb wave functions of continuum and bound states. The convergence of L2 approximations to continuum and bound states is investigated in the hydrogenic case.
 
 The connection between the L2 approximation and pseudo states is derived by studying the completeness relation for the exact states and the quadrature approximations. Corresponding equivalent weights are shown to be related to a Gaussian quadrature derived from attractive-Coulomb Pollaczek polynomials. Gaussian quadrature rules that are satisfied are calculated numerically.
 
 The use of pseudo states in the close-coupling equations is discussed especially in relation to the Poet [1978] model which gives a highly accurate solution for a simplified model of electron-hydrogen collisions in which only s-wave hydrogen target states are admitted. The convergence of channel potentials which contribute to the close-coupling equations is then examined and discussed the convergence of pseudostate Born amplitudes is studied as a further test in obtaining a good pseudo-state set. In addition, the convergence rate of the L2 approximation to the bound-bound, bound-free channel and free-free channel potentials is examined. The bound-bound, bound-free potentials are shown to converge geometrically while the free-free potentials have very slow convergence.
 
 In order to examine the effect of convergence rates several detailed models are employed and compared with the full Poet calculations. Elastic, discrete inelastic, total ionisation and inelastic cross-sections are presented for the energy interval 1.0 to 3.5 Rydbergs. Triplet scattering is reproduced excellently. Singlet scattering displays minor pseudo-resonance structure for the largest (10 basis set) calculations. Weak coupling approximations are examined.

Although the annuli in hard structures are often used to age fish, such growth zones are not always clearly defined in these structures. Thus, in these cases, it is necessary to use alternative methods for ageing, such as analysis of modal progressions in length-frequency data. However, these types of techniques can usually only identify distinct size classes that correspond to an age class. They thus only enable an individual fish to be aged when it is a member of a discrete size cohort. Such a situation generally only applies to the younger age classes. This thesis reports the results of studies on a species that can be aged using the annuli in one of its hard parts (asteriscus otoliths), i.e. Cnidoglanis macrocephalus, and four species (Amniataba caudavitatta, Apogon rueppellii, Pseudogobius olorum and Favionigobius lateralis) for which it was necessary to use a method such as length-frequency analysis for ageing.
 
 Cnidoglanis macrocephalus is an important recreational and commercial species caught in coastal marine and estuarine environments in south-western Australia. However, all previous detailed studies on the age and growth on this species have focused on estuarine populations. This thesis reports the results of a study of the biology of C. macrocephalus in Princess Royal Harbour, a marine embayment on the south coast of Western Australia. Samples of C. macrocephalus were collected from amongst the macroalgae that were removed from this highly eutrophic embayment by mechanical harvesters. Analysis of the reproductive and size composition data derived from these catches showed that spawning occurs between October and December and that fecundity ranged from 75 in a 384 mm fish to 465 in a 443 mm fish. Small fish (&lt;200 mm) were rarely caught, reflecting the fact that the young of this species are difficult to capture. 
 
 Analysis of the trends exhibited by the marginal increments on otoliths showed that the number of annuli on this hard structure could be used to age C. macrocephalus. The samples of C. macrocephalus collected from Princess Royal Harbour contained female and male fish that had lived for up to 10 and 9 years in age and reached maximum lengths and weights of 523 mm and 745.3 g and 557 mm and 735.8 g, respectively. To overcome the paucity of small fish, von Bertalanffy growth curves were constructed using back-calculated lengths and employing the scale proportional hypothesis and body proportional hypothesis (see Francis 1990). The growth rates of females and males were slower than those in a nearby seasonally closed estuary (Wilson Inlet) and in a permanently open estuary on the lower west coast of Australia (Swan River Estuary). Yield per recruit analyses were conducted in order to ascertain what minimum legal lengths were appropriate for the capture of C. macrocephalus in Princess Royal Harbour, the Swan River Estuary and Wilson Inlet in order to sustain the stocks in those water bodies.
 
 The age and growth of Amniataba caudavittata and Apogon rueppellii in the Swan River Estuary were determined by analysing the trends exhibited by modes in sequential monthly length-frequency data. This was achieved by employing MULTIFAN, which constrained the means of the lengths of the cohorts in successive monthly samples to a seasonal form of the von Bertalanffy growth curve. The resulting growth parameters derived by MULTIFAN were similar to those derived from the growth curves fitted to the means of the cohorts determined independently for each monthly sample by MIX. 
 
 The discreteness of the distributions and modes of size classes in length-frequency data for A. caudavittata and A. rueppellii enabled sound growth curves to be constructed for both of these species. The growth curves of these two sexes of both species were significantly different, with K being lower and L being higher for females. The trends exhibited by these growth curves emphasised that the growth of both species is highly seasonal, with little or no increase in length occurring during the cooler part of the year. The seasonal von Bertalanffy growth equations implied that 'negative growth' occurred in winter, but this is an artefact produced by size-related differences in offshore movements that occur at that time of the year. 
 
 The age and growth of two further species from the Swan River Estuary, Pseudogobius olorum and Favonigobius lateralis, were also studied.  Since P. olorum and F. lateralis both spawn at different times of the year and these times (spring and autumn) are not regularly spaced during the year, they produce new 0+ recruits at two irregularly-spaced times of the year. Consequently, MUTLIFAN cannot be used to analyse the size-distribution data for these two gobiid species. Thus, MIX was used to identify the size classes present in sequential samples and to provide means for the length distributions of those size classes. von Bertalanffy growth equations were then fitted to the mean lengths at the inferred age of the males and females of each size class of each species. It was found appropriate to use the traditional von Bertalanffy growth curve for describing the growth of the product of the spring-spawning group of both species and a seasonal von Bertalanffy growth curve for that of the product of the autumn-spawning groups of both species.
 
 The growth curves, when considered in conjunction with the trends exhibited by reproductive variables, demonstrate that female F. lateralis attains sexual maturity more rapidly and at a larger size than P. olorum. The majority of the female and male progeny of the summer and autumn-spawning groups of F. lateralis reach maturity when they are approximately 3 1/2 and 8 1/2 months old, respectively, compared with five and seven months old, respectively, for P. olorum.
 
 Models, incorporating data on water temperature and salinity and the growth and reproduction characteristics of P. olorum and F. lateralis, were used to postulate how environmental factors might be regulating when these two gobiid species spawn. The results of these models support the conclusion that the bimodal timing of spawning of P. olorum in the upper estuary was regulated by water temperature, with spawning occurring between 20 and 25oC but inhibited by temperatures greater than 25oC. They also showed that, although water temperature also influenced the timing of spawning of F. lateralis in the lower estuary, the onset of spawning by this species only occurred when salinities had reached 300/00.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/410/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mad science: discourses of 'schizophrenia'and 'therapy' for hearing voices</field><field name="creator">Wise, Michael</field><field name="description">People who are diagnosed with 'severe mental illness' experience some of the most extreme and pervasive prejudice of all groups in Western society. How can this still be so? Although the term 'mental illness' is typically reserved for the most 'serious' of 'cases', psychiatry's medical model is expanding into increasingly everyday realms. Thus, in concert with efforts to reduce social stigma, 'mental illness' is becoming 'normal'. Nevertheless, 'abnormality' is a requirement of biopsychiatry and its offshoots; professionals require some 'thing' to remedy. How do 'clinical' professionals manage these tensions? And what alternatives are there to the pathologizing of such phenomena? 
 
 Such concerns are considered in relation to my main thesis question: How do professionals represent 'schizophrenia' and hearing voices in theoretical texts, and how is that played out in the minutiae of therapy practices? Drawing on discourse analysis and conversation analysis, I critique professional categorizations of what are typically known as 'schizophrenia', 'mental illness', 'patients', 'clients', and 'therapists'. My case in point is the experience of hearing voices - pathologically known as 'auditory hallucinations'. 'Delusional' beliefs are also considered.
 
 In Part 1, accounts of voices as supernatural or ordinary phenomena, or as a 'symptom' of 'severe mental illness', are considered. Mainstream psychiatric and psychological texts are analyzed and critical alternatives are summarized. 
 
 In Part 2, a selection of studies of interactions involving 'severe mental illness' are reviewed and ongoing analytic/methodological debates are discussed. A cognitivebehavioural therapy group for hearing distressing voices then provides data from 'clinical' talk-in-interaction for analysis. I focus on negotiations of 'reality' (the ordinary versus the psychiatric) and on what I take to be sanist prejudice-in-action. 
 
 Part 3 relates findings from Part 2 to the context and findings of Part 1. There is also discussion of the positive implications of a more social and dialogical approach to understanding and otherwise dealing with the phenomena in question; for voice hearers, 'schizophrenics', and society at large.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/411/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural fluency for young children with autism</field><field name="creator">Bonser, David John</field><field name="description">Fluency is functionally defined by: skill retention after a period without practice; skill endurance over longer intervals than encountered during practice; skill stability in the face of distraction; a performance that can be effortlessly applied to new environments; and a skill that adduces easily with other skills to form new repertoires (RESAA).

However, a lack of published empirical support has meant that many behavioural educators have resisted adopting these strategies. The purpose of the current study was to determine if frequency-building procedures will promote the fluent skill development of tasks encountered on many early intervention programs for 12 young children with autism. 
 
 The data showed that imitation, line tracing, drawing, simple addition, and phoneme reading skills taught to young children with autism achieved RESAA outcomes and responded to frequency building procedures in ways that were consistent with non-autistic populations. Secondly, frequency-building imitation to a rate-based fluency aim produced far greater gains on measures of generalised, imitation than using discrete trial training to an accuracy-based mastery criterion alone. Thirdly, increases in the rate of performance under frequency-building conditions positively predicted increases in the quality and quantity of applications, adductions, and skill generalisation for most skills. Fourthly, more exemplars are preferable to few during frequency-building practice. Fifthly, gross motor imitation, a controlled-operant task by definition, was modified and practiced to rates high enough to achieve RESAA criteria. Finally, discrete trial training was as effective as frequency-building when matched for reinforcement and practice, however was less efficient and rated less enjoyable by 5 children without developmental disabilities. 
 
 The findings were consistent with behavioural fluency predictions and support the inclusion of frequency building strategies to promote skill fluency for young children with autism.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/412/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphite induces morphological and molecular changes in Phytophthora species</field><field name="creator">Wong, Mee-Hua</field><field name="description">The influence of the chemical phosphite on Phytophthora species was investigated by studying the morphological and molecular changes induced by phosphite.
 
 In vitro experiments were conducted to study the effects of phosphite on five isolates of each of five species of Phytophthora grown in low phosphate defined medium. Sensitivity to phosphite varied greatly among the five isolates of each species and resulted in a significant interaction between isolate and phosphite effect. The EC50 values ranged from less than 5 to 10 mcg/ml for P. cinnamomi, to 13 mcg/ml for P. nicotianae, to 27 mcg/ml for P. citricola, to 24 mcg/ml for P. palmivora and to 49 mcg/ml for P. capsici.
 
 Phosphite concentrations from 5 to 100 mcg/ml caused different degrees of morphological changes. Mycelial growth of all species was significantly suppressed by phosphite at 5 mcg/ml while at 100 mcg/ml there was hyphal lysis. Swelling of hyphae with stunted sidebranches and shrinking of cytoplasm from hyphal tips and hyphal walls were characteristic changes observed. Phosphite also retarded the development and caused distortion and lysis of chlamydospores, sporangia and zoospores. Zoosporogenesis was also adversely affected.
 
 Differential display reverse transcription-PCR was used to study changes in gene expression in P. cinnamomi induced in response to phosphite stress. The differential conditions were simulated by growth on a defined medium with and without phosphite amendment. This technique resulted in the isolation of 34 putative differentially expressed cDNA fragments which were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequences of 26 of these cDNA clones were generated. BLASTX analysis of these nucleotide sequences against the NCBI database revealed that 18 exhibited homology to gene sequences encoding known proteins involved in various biological processes. The remaining eight showed homology to either hypothetical or unknown or unnamed proteins.
 
 The expression level of four of these cDNA clones were further analysed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green 1 assay. Three candidate endogenous reference genes namely, tubulin, cyclophilin and actin were evaluated to determine their expression level under the influence of phosphite. None of these genes were significantly regulated by phosphite. As tubulin had the highest expression among the three, it was chosen as the endogenous reference gene. Amplification efficiencies between the reference gene and each of the target genes were validated and found to be approximately equal or within 5% of each other. The relative gene expression between the phosphite-treated and untreated samples can thus be determined using the comparative CT ([Delta][Delta]CT) method. One of the cDNA clones, CP6 which showed differential expression of three-fold was up-regulated. The remaining three were constitutively expressed. CP6 which encodes 1564 nucleotides showed sequence homology, at the amino acid level with proteophosphoglycans from Leishmania major.
 
 This study demonstrated the growth inhibition and morphological deformities caused by phosphite in Phytophthora species. It also illustrated the use of a modified DDRT-PCR method to study genes expressed in phosphite stress regulation. The application of real-time quantitative RT-PCR with SYBR Green I assay facilitated the quantification of the expression level of some of these genes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/413/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School-as-community: bridging the gap to sustainability</field><field name="creator">Wooltorton, Sandra Joyce</field><field name="description">In this research I explore ways in which teachers and parents can enhance the sustainability agenda to bridge the gap towards sustainability through the creation of caring, democratic, just, ecologically regenerative schools-as-communities. I learned that we can only transform ourselves and not others, therefore to transform the model of experience of schooling and society, we need to transform ourselves, the whole community of the school, towards sustainability. This follows the work of Sterling (2001, 2002a and 2002b) which illustrates that education and society will need to change together in a mutually affirming way, since there is no linear cause-effect relationship.
 
 This dissertation focuses on one aspect of the developing field of education for sustainability (EfS). I use radical ecology as the philosophy which supports the vision of community transformation towards sustainability (Orr 2002; Fien 2001; and Sterling 2001). I use the emancipatory research paradigm and detail a participatory epistemology fused with a holistic, constructivist notion of reality, to situate a participative approach which enables important interdisciplinary connections to be made. The research comprises ethnographic research and cooperative inquiry projects that were implemented at two small community schools, as well as reflective practice to develop personal and professional practices of sustainability. Contemporary work in the field of EfS has a cultural understanding of sustainability, which uses four pillars: the biophysical, the social-cultural, the economic and the political. The political pillar is the key organising principle for this research.
 
 The research is significant because I develop and build upon Sterling's (2001) notion of transformative learning for sustainability. I show that participatory structures, procedures and processes are necessary, but not sufficient for a socially transformative school-as-community culture and that socio-ecologically contextualised knowing is transformative knowledge about community sustainability. For people to behave in cooperative ways, they need to develop a practical, reconnective knowledge of cooperation. Likewise, for people to behave in ecologically regenerative ways, they need to develop a practical, reconnective knowledge of ecological reconnection. The research methods of reflective practice and cooperative inquiry are discussed and evaluated as vehicles for transformation towards sustainability. The dissertation thereby assesses their effectiveness in enabling the development of practical knowledge about sustainability. 
 
 In Australia, over the last decade our federal government has shown little interest in fulfilling its own narrowly defined ecological sustainability policy commitments. In Western Australia, our government has recently launched a comprehensive State Sustainability Strategy however its major weakness is that it has afforded very low significance to education at a time when major international organisations such as UNESCO (2002b) see education as an integral part of sustainability and learning as a key to a sustainable future. Sadly, the State Sustainability Strategy does not recommend a reorientation of the education system towards sustainability, does not incorporate a socially critical view of education, and almost completely overlooks the role of learning in the social task of change towards sustainability. In Western Australia, we urgently need policies and political action for commitment through structural reorientation towards EfS. Even in the face of this, a multi-perspectival, inclusive approach to the development of civil society through devolved, locally-based decision making and action within a school community can facilitate the emergence of learning for sustainability in that community. Even within a context of contradiction, tension and paradox, it is possible for school communities to contribute to sustainability through reconnective transformative learning.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/414/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconciliation in the forest?: an exploration of the conflict over the logging of native forests in the south west of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Worth, David John</field><field name="description">Over the past 30 years in Western Australia (WA), there has been a heated debate about the future use of the remaining temperate old-growth forests of karri and jarrah in the south-west of the State.

 Over the past 30 years in Western Australia (WA), there has been a heated debate about the future use of the remaining temperate old-growth forests of karri and jarrah in the south-west of the State. This debate revolved around policy proposals from two social movements: one social movement wanted to preserve as much of the remaining old-growth forests as possible, and an opposing social movement supported a continued 'sustainable' logging of the forests for hardwood products. This research project undertook a comparative case study analysis of one WA organisation from each of these two social movements- Timber Communities Australia (TCA) on the pro-logging side and Liberals For Forests (LFF) on the anti-logging side. It drew on a macro-level European theoretical approach (New Social Movement theory) and a US organizational approach (Resource Mobilisation Theory). The study also investigated the extent to which these two social movement organisations (SMOs) had been effective in influencing the development of State forest policy. For this purpose Schumaker's (1975) framework for judging the political effectiveness of social movements was used. The key research problem investigated in this thesis is why these two SMOs continued to debate the forest policy issue after more than 30 years of public controversy?
 
 Interviews with a key range of stakeholders were the key research method of this study. Additionally, an investigation into important economic and social changes in the south west was undertaken using census and other data between 1971 and 2001 and this was supported by an historical analysis of the timber industry in WA's south west. Finally, a 3-year study of the reporting of forest issues by two local and one national newspaper was completed. The 1998-2000 period was chosen for the newspaper analysis as this was when the new Regional Forest Agreement was being finalised.
 
 This research shows that new values toward the old-growth forests developed among the WA public over the past 30 years and this has created an unbridgeable policy gap between those such as the TCA who wanted the past policies to continue and those such as the LFF who wanted to preserve the remaining native forests. ABS data confirm that the south-west region of WA changed dramatically between 1970 and 2000 as the wine and tourism industries developed and that these changes were different to those occurring in the other wine regions and non-city areas of Australia. As the population increased in this region, a key segment attracted by these new employment opportunities were middle class, well-educated people with new values toward the natural environment.
 
 The interview and newspaper article data clearly showed that the debate in WA in the late 1990s over the proposed RFA provided a new political opportunity for the anti-logging movement to raise their concerns and to establish a renewed public debate about the appropriateness of the WA forest policies. This came at a time when the traditional policy power of the timber industry stakeholders and the government department in charge of the forests (Conservation And Land Management) had been dramatically diminished. The combination of these factors led to the election of the new ALP government and the introduction of a new, non-logging policy for WA's old-growth native forests.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/415/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Convergent close-coupling calculations of positron-helium collisions</field><field name="creator">Wu, Huayou</field><field name="description">The Convergent Close Coupling (CCC) method is applied, for the first time, to the scattering of positrons on helium. The helium target wave functions are obtained within various configuration interaction (CI) expansions. In the full CI expansion the two electrons are treated equally and thus all electron-electron correlations are taken into account. In the frozen-core (FC) approximation the CI expansion fixes one of the electrons to be described by a pure 1s orbital of He+, while maintaining the required singlet and triplet symmetries. Lastly, the multi-configuration (MC) approximation relaxes the FC approximation to allow the description of the inner electron to include several low-lying orbitals and is therefore more accurate than the FC approximation. The accuracy of the target wave functions is tested by comparing the calculated energy levels with the experimental data.
 
 Based on positron-hydrogen scattering, comprehensive close-coupling formulas for positron-helium scattering are developed. The reduced two-centre V-matrix elements are derived in momentum space for various channels. These include direct, excitation and rearrangement channels, i.e. positronium formation.
 
 We first consider low energy positron-helium elastic scattering for energies below the positronium formation threshold of 17.8 eV. Utilizing a single-centre expansion the elastic cross section and phase shifts have been calculated as a function of the positron incident energy. The calculations agree very well with the experimental data and the variational calculations, but not previous single- or double-centre close-coupling calculations.
 
 We then consider energies above the first ionization threshold (24.6 eV) and calculate helium elastic, excitation, fragmentation and total cross sections within the single-centre expansion approach. Good agreement with the available experimental and other theoretical results has been obtained.
 
 The studies have proved that a single-centre expansion, with accurate target state description, can deliver accurate data of practical value over a broad range of energies. However in the low-energy region, between the positronium formation threshold of 17.8 eV and the ionization threshold of 24.6 eV, implementation of the two-centre expansion is required. We expect this work to be undertaken in the near future, based on the derivations presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/416/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformation of Rhizoctonia solani</field><field name="creator">Wu, Jiang</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to develop a genetic transformation system for the plant pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani (teliomorph, Thanatephprus cucumeris Frank [Donk]). The availability of a transformation system would allow us to study gene exchange, epidemiology, and to use techniques such as gene disruption or gene silencing to investigate the role of fungal enzymes in pathogenesis.  
 
 The approach adopted was to use Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transform the fungus as reports in the literature suggested that this was the most efficient and easiest method to use. As a preliminary test, Fusarium oxysporum was transformed using a binary vector (pBINAN) containing a hygromycin resistance gene under control of an ascomycete promoter and terminator. Hygromycin resistant transformants were obtained after co-incubation of fungal conidia with the bacterium. The presence of the transgene was confirmed by analysis of DNA. The number of transformants depended on the genetic background of the A tumefaciens. Strains AGLO or AGRO gave higher numbers of transformants compared to LBA4404. No transformants were obtained when the hygromycin gene was under control of a basidiomycete (pBINHL1), or a plant (CaMV35S) promoter. Since the basidiomycete promoter used in pBINHL1 originates from Ustilago maydis, the vector was tested by transformation of Ustilago cynodontis. Stable transformants of U cynodontis were obtained with this vector.
 
 A series of experiments were carried out on transformation of R. solani mycelium. Both the protoplast and the Agrobacterium transformation methods were tested. Parameters affecting protoplast production and regeneration were examined. Protoplast production varied with the age of the mycelium, with the osmotic stabilizer used, and with time of treatment with protoplasting enzymes. Regeneration of protoplasts was also affected by the osmotic stabilizer and the growth medium. Transformation of several isolates from different anastomosis groups (AG) was attempted by inducing protoplasts to take up DNA using polyethyleneglycol. Two plasmids were used; (1) pAN7-1 containing the resistance gene under control of an ascomycete promoter, and (2) pHL-1 in which the resistance gene is under control of a basidiomycete promoter. No transformants were obtained.
 
 Attempts were then made to transform mycelium and protoplasts using A tumefaciens. The experiments used both mycelium and protoplasts as the recipient.  A number of small resistant colonies were obtained using binary plasmid (pBINHL1) in which mycelium was transformed with the resistance gene was driven by the basidiomycete promoter. On transfer to fresh medium these colonies would grow to about 2cm diameter, and then stop growing. On a second transfer to fresh medium they failed to show any growth. No resistant colonies were obtained from A. tumefaciens transformation of  protoplasts. 
 
 To improve transformation efficiency, a vector was constructed in which the hygromycin resistance gene was fused to an R solani laccase promoter sequence. No resistant colonies were obtained using this vector. Further experiments were carried out using a hygromycin resistance gene specially modified for expression in basidiomycetes by the insertion of artificial introns in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, and a number of AT to CG conversions in the coding region. Most of the recipient isolates gave transformants with the unstable resistance phenotype. However, one AG 6 isolate gave transformants with a stable resistance phenotype. Of six transformants recovered from this isolate, five were shown by PCR and southern blotting to contain the transgene. In four of these transformants the resistance phenotype was stable in the absence of selection.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/417/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of low temperature on boron nutrition of oilseed rape and sunflower</field><field name="creator">Ye, Zhengqian</field><field name="description">Several reports appear in the literature linking low temperature damage in plants with boron (B) deficiency and alleviation of low temperature injury with B application has been reported in some crops and trees. These results imply that low temperature might increase plant B requirements, beside the reduction of B uptake by plant roots, or that low B tissues might be more sensitive to cold temperature damage than B adequate tissues. In controlled experiments, it has been shown that low root zone temperature (RZT) induces B deficiency in cassava, a tropical root crop. Apart from this, there are few definitive detailed investigations on low temperature effects on B nutrition of plants, including temperate species which are more tolerant of low temperature.
 
 Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), a crop sensitive to low B supply, is a major crop in the middle and lower Yangtse river basin, China, where low B soils are widespread. Appearance of B deficiency in oilseed rape often coincides with cold weather during its winter and spring growth. However, the incidence and severity of B deficiency of oilseed rape plants and the efficacy of B fertilization varies from year to year and location to location in ways that are not explained simply by differences in cultivar, agronomy or soil B levels. Low temperature is probably one of the important environmental factors influencing growth and yield of oilseed rape in relation to B nutrition.
 
 Therefore,the objective of the studies in this thesis was to investigate mechanisms of low temperature effects on B nutrition of plants with emphasis on oilseed rape. Field and glasshouse experiments were carried out and the physiological basis of plant response to B at different air and root temperatures is discussed. 
 
 A field experiment with oilseed rape cv. Zheyouyou 2 was carried out on a red soil (Hapludult, US Soil Taxonomy) with low B availability in Zhejiang province, China. Canopy covers made from transparent plastic sheets, which increased night temperatures by up to 1.5 oC around shoots for 15 days in early February, strongly increased shoot dry weight at all levels of B supply. Furthermore, covering plants increased shoot dry weight of B deficient plants without increasing their leaf B concentration. This suggests that internal B requirements were decreased by canopy covering, possibly due to higher temperatures within the canopy.
 
 Experiments conducted to investigate the effect of RZT (10 and 20 oC) on oilseed rape cv. Hyola 42 response to B in solution culture, in summer and winter, showed that regardless of canopy conditions, low RZT (10 oC) promoted the distribution of shoot B towards the actively growing leaves, especially when B supply was low. At low B supply, B deficiency symptoms appeared later at 10 oC than 20 oC RZT and B concentrations in the youngest fully opened leaves (YOL) were higher in plants grown at RZT of 10 oC than that at 20 oC. Growth of plant dry weight (DW) was not affected by RZT in the summer but was greatly reduced at 10 oC than 20 oC in winter. In B adequate plants, shoot to root ratio (S/R ratio) was not affected by RZT regardless of canopy conditions. By contrast, S/R ratio was smaller in low B plants at 10 oC than 20 oC. In addition, low RZT delayed occurrence of plant B deficiency symptoms regardless of plants' pre-treatment RZT (either 10 or 20 oC). These results appeared to contradict the response to low RZT found in previous studies with cassava.
 
 In a subsequent experiment, low RZT of 5 oC not only greatly reduced plant DW production of oilseed rape, but also accentuated plant B deficiency. Partitioning of B into the young growing shoots was also depressed and a significant decrease of B concentration in the youngest shoot parts was caused by 5 oC RZT in comparison with that at the control RZT (10 oC). Similar results were also observed in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv. Hysun 25). But B deficiency symptoms in sunflower were induced by RZT as high as 12 oC, when plants were supplied with 0.25 mcg B, whilst these plants were free from B deficiency at warmer RZT (17 - 27 oC). Higher external B concentrations were required at such RZT (Chilling temperature) for plant growth free from B deficiency. Therefore, there is a RZT threshold below which an increased response to B is expected in plants of oilseed rape and sunflower. And in the range of chilling RZT, the external B requirement for shoot growth increased with lower RZT. The threshold RZT was considerably higher in the chilling-sensitive plant species, sunflower, than in oilseed rape, a chilling-resistant plant species.
 
 At chilling RZT, leaf functioning was impaired by low B supply as measured by potassium (K) leakage from the youngest mature leaf blade (YML) of sunflower, whereas it was much less directly affected by RZT, and there was no effect of RZT on B- adequate plants. By contrast to leaves, root function was impaired more by chilling RZT than low B.
 
 Despite their different threshold RZT, in both oilseed rape and sunflower, the rates of B uptake (BUR) and B translocation from root to shoot (BTR) were dramatically depressed by chilling RZT especially at low B supply (0.2 mcg B): being only 30% of those at the control (5 oC vs 10 oC RZT) in oilseed rape and 33% (10 oC vs 20 oC RZT) in sunflower, respectively. By contrast, there was little or no difference over a range of warmer RZT (10 - 20 oC for oilseed rape, and 20 - 27 oC for sunflower). It is predicted that higher rates of B application will be required for plant growth when soil temperature is below a critical threshold, which is between 5 and 10 oC for oilseed rape, and about 17 oC for sunflower, respectively. Below the threshold RZT plant B deficiency was induced and accentuated due to impairment of B translocation into growing shoot parts besides the decrease of B uptake rate and B transport rate and greater shoot to root ratio.
 
 In comparison with RZT, little is known about causal mechanisms linking cold air temperature and B nutrition. Experiments in this thesis showed not only B transport to the shoot was strongly reduced by low night air temperature during a 6 day period (11.719.4 vs 15.5 - 23.5 oC), but also that an overnight chilling (at 0 oC) could cause more severe injury to low B than adequate B leaves of oilseed rape plants, expressed by higher solute leakage, in comparison with control (at 10 oC). Moreover, after chilling treatment, solute leakage from low B leaves was increased by exposure to light, which suggests that low temperature injury to leaves in low B plants after a freezing night in the field is at least partly a consequence of light induced damage of leaves.
 
 In summary, at chilling temperature, B uptake, transport and partitioning into growing shoots are strongly impaired, and B use efficiency in the growing tissues might be reduced as well. Low temperature contributes to plant B deficiency also by increasing S/R ratio, so that shoot B demand is not satisfied by available B. Furthermore, low air temperature might increase the internal B requirement for shoot growth. To further understand mechanisms of low temperature, especially the air temperature, effects on plant responses to B, more research is needed, such as the relationship between low temperature and B incorporation into cell walls which may play an important role in leaf tolerance to chilling temperature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/418/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water consumption patterns in Australian Aboriginal communities</field><field name="creator">Yuen, Emma</field><field name="description">Aboriginal Australians have a significantly lower health status than their non-Aboriginal counterparts.  To facilitate healthy living practices necessary for good health, a high level investment is currently made in water services, on the assumption that there is a relationship between the volume and quality of water supplied with health outcomes, despite the high economic and environmental cost.  This thesis investigates whether the current design supply criteria of 1000-1200    litres per person per day of water, meeting the Australian Drinking Water Quality Guidelines, is both sufficient and necessary to improve the health of Aboriginal Australians.  The scope of the thesis is limited to the sufficiency of design guidelines although it necessarily also touches on the broader issues of Aboriginal health.  
 
 Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to explore current water consumption patterns of consumers at multiple hierarchical levels (community, household and individual) and hence the requirements of physical infrastructure on which consumers depend.  Multiple linear regression was used to consider factors correlated with supply volume, while metering was used at both the domestic and appliance level to determine where and how water was used.  Meters were installed on fixtures in two houses in a community near Alice Springs.  This was then complemented by qualitative information obtained through focus group discussions, key informant interviews and observation in the field.  The appropriateness of the supply of high quality water for all uses was addressed by considering the volume of drinking water intake and its impact on the derivation of water quality guidelines.  This was achieved by a face-to-face survey involving 57 volunteers.  Fieldwork was conducted predominantly in three communities near Alice Springs although some additional data was collected in other communities in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. 
 
 The results showed that the factors influencing water consumption were highly complex and variable between communities and individuals.  However, there were some culturally specific needs identified in Aboriginal communities, such as the need for temperature and dust control, as well as the reduction of losses.  The unique characteristics of each community made it difficult to provide a more precise estimate for design supply.  As a result, overly conservative guidelines such as those already used are necessary in the short term despite there being no guarantee of improved health.  In the long term, issues of community governance and capacity building will start to be addressed, and the realisation that social systems are both complex and dynamic will need to be reflected in policy.  These issues were represented in a systemic conceptual model at the end of the thesis, which also highlighted inadequacies of reductionist approaches such as design supply guidelines.  The thesis concluded that complex problem situations such as that of health, require a systems approach.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/419/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a resin-in-pulp process for the recovery of nickel and cobalt from laterite leach slurries</field><field name="creator">Zainol, Zaimawati</field><field name="description">The processing of laterite ores for the recovery of nickel and cobalt has increased as the reserves of exploitable sulphide ores have become depleted. The pressure acid leach process (PAL) has become the preferred option for the treatment of laterite ores.
 
 Difficulties associated with the poor settling characteristics of the pulp in the counter current decantation (CCD) circuit after pressure leaching has resulted in as much as 10% of the soluble nickel and cobalt reporting to the tailings. The objective of this project is the development of an alternative processing step for the recovery of soluble nickel and cobalt from the PAL tailings using resin-in-pulp (RIP) technology.
 
 Commercially available chelating resins with the iminodiacetate functional group have been studied for their suitability for the adsorption of nickel and other metal ions from PAL tailings pulp. The Amberlite IRC 748 resin was found to be superior despite its lower nominal loading capacity. The resin with the highest nominal capacity was observed to adsorb less nickel as a result of the adsorption of greater amounts of the impurity ions. The equilibrium loading for nickel on the preferred resin was found to be similar from the ammonium and protonated form of the resin although the kinetics of adsorption is greater when the resin is initially in the ammonium form. 
 
 A comprehensive study has been made of the equilibrium adsorption of several metal ions on the resin as a function of the equilibrium pH of the solution. A relatively simple model of the equilibrium adsorption which includes the effect of pH has been developed and the results compared with the experimental data obtained in the M2+/Na+/H+ system. The model which requires two equilibrium constants has been found to fairly well describe the experimental results.
 
 A study of the kinetics of the loading of nickel and cobalt from both solutions and pulp has shown that the rate can be described in terms of a first-order approach to equilibrium. The kinetic and equilibrium parameters were used to simulate the performance of a multi-stage counter current resin-in-pulp operation A semiquantitative study of the elution of the adsorbed metal ions from the resin by dilute sulphuric acid solutions was also undertaken.
 
 The technical feasibility of the RIP process for the recovery of nickel and cobalt from the PAL tailings has been successfully demonstrated in both laboratory and pilot-plant studies using a five-stage adsorption process. Important parameters such as the operating pH and the residence times of pulp and resin in each stage were identified through the batch test work coupled to the simulation procedure. The optimum pH for adsorption was found to be in the range 4 to 5 as this pH is high enough to maximise the adsorption of nickel and cobalt while preventing precipitation of nickel and cobalt as hydroxides from the pulp. A method for minimizing the competition from more strongly loaded ions such as iron(II) and chromium(III) which are present in the pulp was also developed in the initial laboratory phase of the project and utilized during the pilot operation.
 
 Problems associated with the preparation of the pulp preparation, elution of the loaded resin and control of the adsorption train were resolved during several pilot plant runs on site at a local PAL plant. These and other minor improvements and adjustments to the operating procedure culminated in a successful continuous run for several days during which the target recovery of 90% for nickel and 60% for cobalt was exceeded throughout the run.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/420/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relation between distress-risk, B/M and return: is it consistent with rational pricing?</field><field name="creator">Zaretzky, Kaylene</field><field name="description">Fama and French (1995, 1996) argue that the high-minus-low (HML) book-tomarket (B/M) factor in their 1993 three-factor model is a proxy for a distress-risk return premium and that the model is consistent with rational pricing. Alternative views are that the HML premium is caused by irrational behaviour or market inefficiencies.
 
 Dichev (1998) finds that high distress-risk firms have low, not high, B/M and earn low returns. He also finds a systematic relation between the distress-risk characteristic and return, independent of the B/M characteristic. The effect of differences in the methodology used by Fama and French (1995) and Dichev (1998) has not been examined. In addition, there is no evidence of whether a distress-risk return premium is important in describing returns.
 
 Examination of the characteristics and returns of sorted distress-risk portfolios shows that most high distress-risk, positive book-equity NYSE-AMEX firms do have high B/M. However, for both the NYSE-AMEX and NASDAQ, small firms with high distress-risk have low B/M ratios. A positive relation between distress-risk and return is not found for either NYSE-AMEX or NASDAQ firms. A distress-minus-solvent (DMS) return premium constructed using Fama and French (1993) methodology is negative and significant. 
 
 Regression results show that both the HML and the DMS factors are important in describing the time-series of returns. However, the HML factor is of only marginal importance when examining sorted distress-risk portfolio returns. In addition, the HML coefficients are related to the B/M characteristic, rather than distress-risk, when both sorted distress-risk and characteristic-balanced portfolio returns are examined.
 
 The combined evidence suggests that HML cannot be interpreted as a return premium related to financial distress. However, a systematic relation does exist between distress-risk and return. The evidence supports a market inefficiency or irrational behaviour, rather than a risk based explanation of asset returns. Investors pay too much for financially distressed firms and subsequently earn low returns.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/421/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidation of refractory gold concentrates and simultaneous dissolution of gold in aerated alkaline solutions</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Suchun</field><field name="description">The oxidation of refractory gold concentrates containing arsenopyrite and pyrite and the simultaneous dissolution of gold in aerated alkaline solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures without the addition of cyanide has been studied. It involves the following aspects: the chemistry of the oxidation of pure arsenopyrite and pyrite minerals in aerated alkaline solutions; the kinetics of oxidation of arsenopyrite and the simultaneous dissolution of gold in such solutions; the kinetics of simultaneous dissolution of gold during the alkaline oxidation of refractory gold concentrates; the electrochemistry of gold in alkaline solutions containing thiosulfate or monothioarsenate; the effect of copper on the leaching of gold in alkaline thiosulfate solutions; and the leaching of gold in alkaline solutions with thioarsenites.
 
 The nature and proportions of the products of the oxidation of arsenopyrite in aerated alkaline solutions have been studied using high pressure ion chromatography techniques that have shown that thiosulfate and a new species, monothioarsenate, are the main oxidation products of arsenopyrite apart from arsenate and sulfite. The alkaline oxidation of pyrite primarily yields thiosulfate and sulfite. A kinetic investigation of the oxidation of arsenopyrite with air or oxygen has shown that the initial rate of arsenopyrite oxidation is proportional to the concentration of dissolved oxygen. A reaction mechanism for the oxidation of arsenopyrite has been proposed, which involves an anodic oxidation of the mineral involving hydroxyl ions coupled to a cathodic process for oxygen reduction which is partially controlled by mass transfer of dissolved oxygen to the mineral surface.
 
 Detailed studies of the dissolution behaviour of gold in aerated alkaline solutions in the presence of thiosulfate or monothioarsenate by electrochemical and leaching methods have demonstrated that the dissolution rate is very low as compared to that of gold in alkaline cyanide or ammoniacal thiosulfate solutions. It has been found that copper ions catalyze the dissolution of gold in the thiosulfate solutions in the absence of ammonia. The leaching experiments also have shown that gold may dissolve in alkaline thioarsenite solutions, which provides a possible new process option for the leaching of gold.
 
 The oxidation of refractory arsenical gold concentrates in aerated alkaline solutions results in the formation of thiosulfate, arsenate and sulfate as well as the dissolution of gold, copper and iron. It appears that the dissolution of gold is due to the complex reactions of gold with thiosulfate ions promoted by the catalytic effect of copper ions. Up to 80% of the gold may be extracted during the oxidation of selected refractory arsenical</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/422/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production of laccase by the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani</field><field name="creator">Bora, Pranjal</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into the production of laccases by the phytopathogenic soil fungus Rhizoctonia solani. The fungus causes maceration of plant tissue by the production of a variety of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. Whilst most attention has focused on the role of pectinases in maceration, the laccases which degrade lignin are likely to be important in this process.
 
 The production of laccase by the AG-11 isolate VR20 in V8 medium reached a maximum after 6 days incubation. Laccase activity was unaffected by variation in temperatures over the range 4-15 degrees C, but as the temperature increased the activity increased to a maximum at 25 degrees C. This high level activity was maintained as the temperature was increased to 37 degrees C. The effects of pH on laccase activity was also determined. Activity was stable over the pH range 4.5-6. Outside this range the activity decreased significantly.
 
 The composition of the growth medium also had a significant effect on laccase production. Similar levels of activity were observed during growth in V8, apple pectin media, or in media containing ground up lupin hypocotyls as a carbon source. However, approx 20 fold higher levels were obtained after growth in Czapek-Dox medium.
 
 Different laccase activity band patterns were obtained by zymogram analysis of culture supernatants. The production of the other cell wall degrading enzymes pectinase,xylanase and cellulase in these media was assessed for comparison. Whilst all three were produced in V8 and apple pectin media, cellulase was not produced in lupin medium, and none of these were produced in Czapek-Dox medium.
 
 Attempts to increase laccase production by the addition of the reported laccase inducers CuSO4.5H2O, p-anisidine, ethanol, MnSO4.7H2O, resveratrol, and tannic acid to the growth medium showed mixed results. The only case where enhancement of synthesis was observed was with the addition of MnSO4 to Czapek-Dox medium. This compound did not enhance production in the other media tested. With the exception of p-anisidine, the other inducers had minimal effect in V8, apple pectin or lupin media. Para anisidine completely inhibited production in lupin medium. With the exception of MnSO4, all inducers inhibited laccase production in Czapek-Dox medium, with p-anisidine causing complete inhibition.
 
 The production of xylanase and cellulase was also inhibited by these inducers but in a growth medium dependent manner. Cellulase production in V8 medium was inhibited by ethanol, MnSO4, resveratrol, and tannic acid whilst only the latter two inhibited xylanase production and none of these inhibited pectinase production. In contrast, p-anisidine had a greater inhibitory effect on pectinase and xylanase production in V8 medium than on cellulase production. Para-anisidine also inhibited xylanase (and laccase) but not pectinase production in lupin medium but not in apple pectin medium. Resveratrol and tannic acid also inhibited xylanase production in lupin medium. The effects of the inhibitory compounds EDTA and SDS on laccase activity was determined. With SDS the % inhibition increased as the concentration of inhibitor decreased from 5% to 0.5%. With EDTA the opposite trend was observed. The effects of arginine on laccase activity was also tested. At concentrations of 0.5 to 5% arginine, laccase activity was completely inhibited.
 
 Laccase activity was purified from the culture supernatant by anion exchange chromatography, and by electroelution from a native-PAGE gel. The degree of purification by each method was greater than 50 fold. Electrophoresis of the purified protein on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by staining with Coomassie blue showed two protein bands of 66 and 38 KDa. Measurement of the absorption spectrum of the purified protein showed two absorbance maxima, at 240 and 340nm.
 
 Laccases produced by isolates from different anastomosis groups were analysed by staining gels for laccase activity. Variations in the band pattern were observed both between and within anastomosis groups. Analysis of single spore isolates from AG-8 and AG-11 showed segregation of band patterns. However the sample sizes were too small to make conclusions about the numbers of laccase enzymes produced by or the number of genes in the parent field isolates.
 
 The role of laccases in maceration of lupin radicle tissue was investigated. Microscopic staining showed the presence of lignin in radicle tissue, and when incubated in the fungal enzymes the tissue lost integrity, characteristic symptoms of maceration. Maceration wasreadily observed as discolouring when the radicle was incubated in a solution of fungal enzyme. The degree of maceration was quantified by measuring the length of the discoloured region. Enzymes from all of the isolates tested caused maceration of lupin radicle. The degree of maceration ranged from 80-100%. No maceration was observed when agrinine was included in the reaction mixture. Arginine does not inhibit the activity of pectinases, xylanases, or cellulases. In maceration assays with potato tuber tissue which does not contain lignin, the addition of arginine to the reaction did not inhibit maceration. The results show that laccases are required for maceration of lignified tissue, but not for non-lignified tissue. Laccase gene sequences were cloned from three isolates, SCR122 (AG-6), 11034 (AG-8), and VR20 (AG-11) using degenerate primers to conserved sequences to amplify the gene sequences. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced. A BLAST search of the NCBI database with the derived amino acid sequences confirmed that the sequences were from laccase genes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/423/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and habitat types in nearshore marine and estuarine waters along the lower west coast of Australia</field><field name="creator">Wildsmith, Michelle</field><field name="description">The following four broad aims were addressed in this study. (1) To ascertain whether the characteristics of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages within the different nearshore marine habitat types identified by Valesini et al. (2003) on the lower west coast of Australia differ significantly, and whether the pattern of those spatial differences matches those among the environmental characteristics that were used to distinguish those habitat types; (2) To develop a quantitative approach for classifying nearshore habitats in estuarine waters that employs readily-available data for a range of enduring environmental characteristics, and to use that approach to classify the various habitat types present in nearshore waters of the Swan-Canning Estuary on the lower west coast of Australia; (3) To test the hypothesis that the characteristics of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in the in the Swan-Canning Estuary differ significantly among nearshore habitat types, and that the pattern of those differences matches that among the environmental characteristics used to distinguish those habitat types and (4) To test the hypothesis that, as a result of environmental changes in the Swan-Canning Estuary, the characteristics of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at various habitats in this estuary in 1986/7 differ from those in 2003/4.
 
 To address the first aim, benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled seasonally for one year in the subtidal waters and intertidal zone (upper and lower swash zones) at the six nearshore habitat types that were identified by Valesini et al. (2003) on the lower west coast of Australia. The habitat types, which differed mainly in the extent of their exposure to wave activity and whether seagrass and/or nearshore reefs were present, had been distinguished quantitatively using values for a suite of seven statistically-selected enduring environmental characteristics. The faunal samples yielded a total of 121 species representing eight phyla, among which the Polychaeta, Malacostraca and Bivalvia were the most speciose classes and contributed ~ 38, 23 and 10%, respectively, to the total number of individuals. The total number of species and mean density of macroinvertebrates was far greater at the most protected habitat type (1), which also contained dense beds of seagrass, than at any other habitat type, i.e. 70 species and 209.2 individuals 0.1 m-2, compared to 32 species and 36.9 individuals 0.1 m-2 at the most exposed habitat type (6), which had a substrate comprised only of sand. Differences among habitat type influenced the benthic macroinvertebrate species composition to a greater extent than differences among either zones or seasons. Significantly different faunal compositions were detected among those latter two factors only at the most protected habitat type. The faunal assemblage at habitat type 1 was clearly the most distinct from those at the other five habitat types, particularly in the subtidal zone (R-statistics=0.642-0.831, p=0.1%), and was typified by five abundant polychaete species that were adapted to deposit-feeding. In contrast, the fauna at habitat type 6 was typified by four crustacean species and a species of bivalve and polychaete, whose mobility and tough external surface facilitated their survival and feeding in those turbulent waters. The extents of the differences in species composition among the six habitat types was significantly matched with that among the suite of enduring environmental characteristics that distinguished those habitat types, particularly in the case of the subtidal zone (Rho=0.676). Such results indicated that the environmental variables used to distinguish the nearshore habitat types could be used to reliably predict the types of benthic macroinvertebrate species likely to occur at any site along the lower west coast of Australia.
 
 The above biological validation of the nearshore marine habitat classification scheme developed by Valesini et al. (2003) provided the justification for the approach to the second broad aim of this study, namely to develop a quantitative scheme for classifying habitat types in the Swan-Canning Estuary. This approach was similar to that employed by Valesini et al. (2003) in that it considers that differences among habitat types are well reflected by differences in a suite of enduring environmental variables. However, it improves on that earlier method by employing a completely objective and quantitative approach.
 
 Thus, a large number of environmentally-diverse nearshore sites (102) were initially selected throughout the Swan-Canning Estuary and a suite of 13 enduring environmental variables quantified at each using remotely-sensed images of the estuary in a Geographic Information System. Such variables were chosen to reflect either (i) the type of substrate and submerged vegetation present, (ii) the extent of exposure to wave action or (iii) the location of the site within the estuary with respect to its vicinity to marine and fresh water sources. These data were then subjected to the CLUSTER routine and associated SIMPROF procedure in the PRIMER v6 multivariate statistical package to quantitatively identify those groups of sites that did not differ significantly in their environmental characteristics, and thus represented habitat types. Eighteen habitat types were identified, which were shown to well reflect spatial differences in a suite of non-enduring water quality and sediment characteristics that were measured in situ at a range of estuarine sites during both summer and winter in 2005 (Rho=0.683 and 0.740, respectively, p=0.1%). However, those latter environmental characteristics required far more time in the field and laboratory to quantify than the enduring variables used to identify the habitat types.
 
 Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled during summer and winter in 2005 in the shallow subtidal regions (~1 m depth) at sites representing eight of the habitat types identified in the Swan-Canning Estuary. These samples contained a total of 51 and 36 species during summer and winter, respectively, and, in both seasons, represented nine phyla, namely Annelida, Crustacea, Mollusca, Sipuncula, Nematoda, Platyhelminthes, Cnidaria, Uniramia and Nemertea. The compositions of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages differed significantly among habitat types and, to a similar extent, between seasons (Global R-statistic=0.408 and 0.409, respectively, p=0.1%). However, the spatial differences were considerable greater in winter than in summer (Global R-statistic=0.536 vs 0.280, p=0.1%), presumably due to the greater spatial variation in particular non-enduring in situ environmental characteristics, such as redox depth and salinity. While the number of species, overall density and taxonomic distinctness of benthic macroinvertebrates also differed significantly among habitats, those variables differed to a greater extent between seasons, being greater in winter than in summer. While the measures of taxonomic distinctness tended to be greater at habitat types located in the lower to middle reaches, i.e. habitat types 6, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 18, than the upper reaches i.e. habitat types 1 and 3, the number of species and overall density reflected this trend only during winter. During summer, the mean numbers of species at habitat types 1, 3, 6 and 10 (3.4-6.0) were significantly lower than those at habitat types 7, 13, and 18 (8.8-10.9), whereas the overall density of benthic macroinvertebrates was far greater at habitat type 7 (32260 individuals 0.1 m-2)than at any other habitat type in this season (3135-18552 individuals 0.1 m-2).
 
 Overall, the greatest differences in assemblage composition occurred between those at habitat types 1 and 18 (R-statistic=0.669, p=0.1%), which were located in the uppermost region of the estuary and the lower reaches of the basin, respectively, and differed to the greatest extent in their enduring environmental characteristics. The assemblage at habitat type 1, and also that at habitat type 3, located just downstream, were relatively distinct from those at all other habitat types, particularly during winter (R-statistics=0.666-0.993, p=0.1%). The fauna at the first of these habitat types was relatively depauperate, containing low numbers of species and densities, and was characterised by the polychaetes Leitoscoloplos normalis and Ceratonereis aequisetis and the bivalve Arthritica semen. The assemblage at habitat type 3 was also characterised by those three species and the amphipod Paracorophium minor and the polychaete Boccardiella limnicola. In contrast, the assemblage at habitat type 18 was characterised by a more diverse assemblage, i.e. the polychaetes Capitella capitata, C. aequisetis, L. normalis and Pseudopolydora kempi, the amphipods, Grandidierella propodentata and Corophium minor and the bivalve Sanguinolaria biradiata. The number of species was among the highest at this habitat type during both seasons, which was also reflected in the high taxonomic diversity, and the overall density was the highest in winter and second highest in summer. Despite the above faunal differences, those between assemblages at habitat types 7 and 9, which were both located in the basin of the Swan-Canning Estuary, were similar in magnitude to those that occurred between pairs of habitat types located in two different regions of the estuary. Although both habitat types 7 and 9 were characterised by a similar suite of species, i.e. Oligochaete spp., C. aequisetis, C. capitata, C. minor, G. propodentata, L. normalis, and S. biradiata, the substantial differences in assemblage composition between these habitat types in both summer and winter (R-statistics=0.570 and 0.725, respectively) was due to marked differences in the relative contributions of each of these species.
 
 Significant and strong correlations were shown to exist in both summer and winter between the pattern of differences in the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages among habitat types and that among the enduring environmental characteristics used to identify those habitat types (Rho=0.625 and 0.825, respectively, p=0.1%). Furthermore, these correlations were greater than those obtained between the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna and any combination of the non-enduring environmental characteristics (i.e. water quality and sediment parameters) recorded in situ at each habitat type (Rho=0.508 and 0.824, in summer and winter, respectively, p=o.1%). This demonstrates the greater capacity of surrogate enduring environmental characteristics to account for differences in the range of variables that may influence the distribution of benthic invertebrate fauna. Thus, the lists of characteristic benthic macroinvertebrate taxa produced for each of the eight habitat types studied in the Swan-Canning Estuary provide a reliable benchmark by which to gauge any future changes in those fauna. Moreover, these results indicate that the above habitat classification scheme can be used to reliably predict the types of benthic macroinvertebrate fauna that are likely to occur at any nearshore site of interest in this estuarine system.
 
 The final component of this study showed that the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at four sites in the middle reaches of the Swan-Canning Estuary in 2003/4 differed significantly from those recorded at the same sites in 1986/7. Such differences were reflected in (1) changes in the relative densities of a suite of ten species that were responsible for distinguishing the faunas in these two periods, (2) the absence of 22 rare species in 2003/4 (i.e. 42% of the number of species recorded in 1986/7), (3) the presence of 17 new species in 2003/4, including an abundant polychaete that is likely to have been introduced and (4) a far greater extent of seasonal variation in the number of species and densities of benthic macroinvertebrates in 2003/4. Such changes are likely to be related to lower sediment oxygen levels in certain seasons in 2003/4, as well as an altered hydrological regime due to increased temperatures and decreased rainfall in that more recent period. The fact that these changes have occurred within the Swan-Canning Estuary highlights the need for effective management tools, such as the habitat classification scheme and associated faunal survey undertaken in this study. Such data will provide a sound basis by which to examine the ways in which fauna vary spatially within the system, and allow for the establishment of comprehensive benchmarks for detecting future changes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/424/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of signal transduction in the pathogenicity of Stagonospora nodorum on wheat</field><field name="creator">Tan, Kar-Chun</field><field name="description">The fungus Stagonospora nodorum is the causal agent of leaf and glume blotch disease on wheat and is an emerging model for the study of the interaction between plants and necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Signal transduction plays a critical role during infection by allowing the pathogen to sense and appropriately respond to environmental changes. The role of signal transduction in the pathogenicity of S. nodorum was analysed by the targeted inactivation of genes encoding a G[alpha] subunit (Gna1) and a mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mak2). Strains carrying the inactivated genes were impaired in virulence and demonstrated a host of phenotypic impairments such as abolished sporulation. Therefore, it was hypothesised that Gna1 and Mak2 regulate downstream effector molecules that are critical for pathogenic development. A 2D gel-based proteomic approach was used to compare the extracellular and intracellular proteomes of the wild-type fungus and signalling mutants for differences in protein abundance. Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and patternmatching against the S. nodorum genome sequence led to the identification of 26 genes from 34 differentially abundant protein spots. These genes possess probable roles in protein cycling, plant cell wall degradation, stress response, nucleotide metabolism, proteolysis, quinate and secondary metabolism. A putative short-chain dehydrogenase gene (Sch1) was identified and its expression was shown to be reduced in both signalling mutants. The transcript level of Sch1 increased during the latter period of infection coinciding with pycnidiation. Sch1 was inactivated by targeted gene deletion. Mutants were able to effectively colonise the host but asexual sporulation was dramatically reduced and pycnidial ontogeny was severely disrupted. Furthermore, the sch1 mutants showed alterations in the metabolome. GC-MS analysis identified a metabolite which accumulated in the sch1 mutants. Computational and database analyses indicated that the compound possesses a cyclic carbon backbone. Based on these findings, Sch1 may be a suitable target for fungicides that inhibit asexual sporulation and the accumulated compound may be used to design novel antifungal compounds. 2D SDS-PAGE analysis identified increased abundance of another putative short-chain dehydrogenase (Sch2) and a nitroreductase in the sch1-deleted background. It was also shown that Sch2 was regulated by Gna1.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/425/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge management platform for promoting sustainable energy technologies in rural Thai communities</field><field name="creator">Payakpate, Janjira</field><field name="description">Sustainable energy services aim to meet the energy demands and to improve the living standards of rural communities with the utilization of sustainable energy technologies. Such services are becoming increasingly important due to the reduction of traditional energy resources and the ongoing increase in the demands. The demands are mainly due to the growth of population, domestic consumptions and industrial uses. In addition, increasing awareness of issues such as global warming, carbon emission, peak oil and the need for a sustainable environment has kindled keen interests in sustainable energy around the world. Many projects on sustainable energy services have been launched and particularly in developing countries. In most areas, at least one type of sustainable energy resources is available. In the case of Thailand, in additional to resources such as solar and wind, there are other sustainable energy resources in the forms of biomass and waste residue from agricultural products. However, there exist practical problems hindering the success of many sustainable energy projects. Two key reasons are the lack of in depth knowledge regarding the sustainable energy systems among the local users, and the limited budgets for planning, research and development. Therefore, the need to promote better understanding of sustainable energy technologies is necessary in order to gain better utilization of the energy services and acceptance by the community. One possible solution is the use of a Knowledge Management System (KMS). Based on advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the integration of knowledge management and web technologies has enabled KMS to be developed as an effective tool for the sharing, management and dissemination of valuable knowledge on any particular subject. This combination has the potential to promote the knowledge and initiate relevant activities thereby enabling the acquisition and management of diverse types of information and data.  Typical functions and services which could be provided are: checking updated information on sustainable energy resources around a particular area; teaching of sustainable energy systems development and maintenance processes; sharing of best practices and lessons learned etc. With the availability of the internet, a Web-based KMS will be a valuable channel for the gathering, sharing, extracting and dissemination of knowledge about the sustainable energy services for the Thai communities.  
 
 This thesis presents the research and development of a knowledge management (KM) platform for sustainable energy technologies. The system is implemented with web GIS server-side application and it is installed at the School of Renewable Energy Technology, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand. To assess the effectiveness of the developed system, surveys in the form of pre-questionnaires and post-questionnaires from the users are used. Such information is used to determine the effectiveness of the system and to measure the improvement of the participants' knowledge on the subject. There are three groups of participants involved in this study: local government administrators, researchers and general users. The overall results of the questionnaires reveal that the participants are satisfied with the performance of the KM platform. The results also indicated that the KM platform provides adequate knowledge on the subject and it has a high level of user friendliness. It was found that the participants' knowledge is also increased and the increase is in proportion to the time they engaged with the KM platform. A linear regression analysis of the researchers and local government administrators has shown that the increment of the participants' knowledge has a linear relationship with the learning period on the KM platform with statistical significance. Findings from this study can be used as a guideline and for further development on improving the local Thai communities' knowledge on sustainable energy technologies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/426/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trauma and attachment: the impact of domestic violence on preschool children</field><field name="creator">Boultwood, Bridget</field><field name="description">The effect of domestic violence on the lives of young children and how the children are affected by their mothers' exposure to domestic violence.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/427/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural veterinary practice in Western Australia 1964 to 2007</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, John Alexander Loftus</field><field name="description">Concern for the plight of rural veterinary practice in Australia existed throughout the 20th century. During the 1970s, the profession highlighted the problems faced by rural practitioners and in 2003, the Frawley Review examined current rural veterinary services. However, neither influenced the course of rural practice in Australia.
 
 The present thesis examined the status of rural practice in Western Australia from the 1960s to the present day. It did this by investigating the historical changes in agriculture during this period and their effect on rural practice. The practice at Katanning, in rural Western Australia, was used as a case study - a study of the changes and adaptions made by that practice to remain viable.
 
 In 2006, surveys of both rural practitioners and government veterinary officers were conducted to obtain information of the veterinary services being provided to rural Western Australia. In addition, oral history interviews with a number of respondents to the surveys were carried out.
 
 Rapid expansion of Western Australian agriculture took place during the 1960s and was matched by growth in rural veterinary services. A government subsidy scheme recruited a number of veterinarians to the state. A Preventive Medicine/Animal Production service with sheep was established at Katanning in 1967. The reasons for developing such a service, its promotion, the results achieved and its subsequent failure are documented in the thesis.
 
 The 1970s was a troubled decade for agriculture and for those servicing it. The collapse of the beef-cattle boom was accompanied by a 20% reduction in veterinary staff in rural practice Australia-wide and a number of changes were implemented at Katanning to meet these circumstances.
 
 The 1980s saw a reduction in the economic significance of agriculture in Western Australia. At the same time, students from the Veterinary School at Murdoch University began graduating and, for the first time in the profession's history, an overproduction of veterinarians existed.  
 
 The 1990s was a period of relative stability, but was accompanied by major changes for the profession and rural practice. Many practices adopted merchandising and the sale of pet foods to supplement dwindling income. Previously, a male dominated profession, during this decade, it rapidly changed to one dominated by female graduates. Accompanying this gender change there was an increase in the demand for part-time work, whereas previously the profession had been predominantly a full-time vocation.
 
 The present decade opened with a questioning of the direction being taken by the profession and its undergraduate education. The current study revealed that the government veterinary services in Western Australia have contracted in size and scope, whilst at the same time, most rural practitioners attend companion animals at the expense of economic livestock. As a result, veterinary services to economic livestock have reduced and are likely to continue to do so and suggestions are made to counter this trend.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/428/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Encroachment of sandplain heathland (kwongan) by Allocasuarina huegeliana in the Western Australian wheatbelt: the role of herbivores, fire and other factors</field><field name="creator">Maher, Kellie</field><field name="description">Kwongan, also known as sandplain heathland, occurs in remnant vegetation throughout the fragmented landscape of the Western Australian wheatbelt. This vegetation community has high levels of species richness and endemism, and is of high conservation value. In many vegetation remnants in the wheatbelt the native tree species Allocasuarina huegeliana (rock sheoak) is expanding out from its normal range and encroaching into kwongan. A. huegeliana may ultimately dominate the kwongan, causing a decline in floristic diversity. Altered disturbance regimes, particularly the absence of fire and reduced or absent browsing mammal herbivores, are likely to be responsible for causing A. huegeliana encroachment.
 
 This study used experimental and observational data from patches of kwongan in three Nature Reserves in the central and southern wheatbelt to investigate the role of fire, native mammal activities and interactions between these two factors in shaping A. huegeliana woodland kwongan community boundaries. Investigations were carried out into the characteristics of encroaching A. huegeliana populations; the environmental factors affecting the extent of encroachment, naturally recruited juveniles, and seedling emergence and establishment; historical and current abundances of native mammals; and the effects of mammal herbivores on seedling establishment during inter-fire and post-fire periods.
 
 Results from this study confirm that A. huegeliana has encroached into kwongan throughout the wheatbelt region and recruitment appears likely to continue in most areas. Few of the environmental factors measured in this study affected the extent of encroachment, the locations of naturally recruited A. huegeliana juveniles, and seedling germination and establishment. Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) browsed extensively on seedlings, which largely prevented them from establishing in open areas of kwongan. However, numerous A. huegeliana seedlings escaped browsing herbivores by establishing in perennial shrubs, where they appeared to be tolerant of increased levels of inter-specific competition.
 
 There was no native mammal common to all three Reserves that declined around the time that A. huegeliana encroachment most likely began in the 1970s. In addition, tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) had little effect even where their densities were high. It is therefore unlikely that the decline of an individual mammal species initiated encroachment. A. huegeliana encroachment appears to be driven by increased propagule pressure, which is in turn caused by increased inter-fire intervals. Long periods of time without fire have enabled fire-sensitive A. huegeliana trees to produce increasing quantities of seed that are continuously released into kwongan. A range of other factors may interact synergistically with this process to affect encroachment and these are also discussed. This study considered the implications of these findings for management of remnant vegetation in fragmented landscapes, particularly kwongan in the Western Australian wheatbelt, and areas for further research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/429/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-stakeholder public policy governance and its application to the Internet Governance Forum</field><field name="creator">Malcolm, Jeremy Mark</field><field name="description">There are many networks of transport and communication that cross national borders, but the Internet's infrastructure has been designed to do so with unusual subtlety. As a result, public policy issues raised in governance of the Internet tend to be inherently transnational in nature. This makes the legitimacy of a purely domestic legal approach to Internet governance questionable. The fact that conflicting domestic regimes may interfere with each other, and may clash with the transnational cultural and technical architecture of the Internet, further complicates an approach to governance based around legal rules. But on the other hand more traditional and decentralised mechanisms of Internet governance such as norms, markets and architecture suffer their own deficits of both legitimacy and effectiveness.
 
 Governance by multi-stakeholder network conceptually provides a solution in that it brings together each of the other mechanisms of governance and the stakeholders by whom they are commonly employed. Such a multi-stakeholder approach has begun to permeate (and in some issue areas even to supersede) the existing international system, as partially evidenced in the Internet governance regime by reforms that took root at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and have begun to find expression in its product, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).
 
 Governance by network does not however emerge spontaneously, but requires supportive institutional structures and processes. To maximise the legitimacy and effectiveness of these, and to ensure their interoperability both with the international system and with the architecture of the Internet, requires a balance to be struck between the anarchistic and consensual organisational models typified by 'native' Internet governance institutions such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and hierarchical and democratic models drawn from governmental and private sector examples and from the study of deliberative democracy.
 
 As an early experiment in multi-stakeholder governance by network, the Internet Governance Forum does not quite strike the correct balance: its hierarchical structure under the leadership of the United Nations is incompatible with its multi-stakeholder democratic ambitions, and more importantly it lacks the institutional capacity to fulfil its mandate to contribute to public policy development.
 
 This can largely be redressed by reforming the IGF's plenary body, and its online analogue, as venues for democratic deliberation, subject to the oversight of an executive body or bureau to which each stakeholder group appoints its own representatives, and which is responsible for ratifying any decisions of the larger group by consensus. In particular, requiring this bureau to broker consensus between stakeholder groups (as in a consociation), rather than just amongst its members at large, can assist to diminish the power games that have limited the IGF to date.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/430/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'We don't go to the casino but we're the biggest gamblers in the world': drivers of change in the Mt Magnet and Upper Gascoyne regions</field><field name="creator">Braddick, Lynda</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the complex environmental, social, economic and political challenges surrounding sustainable land use of rangelands by European leaseholders in Western Australia. A study of historical, socio-economic and technological events, combined with the development of social values and policy, exposed a broad suite of factors that shaped pastoralism and grazing, and continues to influence development in these regions today. The thesis also explained how the emergence of the sustainable development paradigm is raising awareness of the ways societies define the issues of development, and the influence of this paradigm on attempts to shape change.
 
 Extensive changes in animal production systems have been made in response to complex factors driving change in pastoralism and grazing in recent years. In the Upper Gascoyne, the change to cattle has resulted in extensive changes in infrastructure and raised new hopes for viable production systems in the future. Station amalgamation or sale of stations to Government Departments have been key factors of change in this region. In the Mt Magnet region, wool production remains dominant. However severe drought conditions and declining wool prices are increasingly forcing change to production of feral goats or Damara sheep. Increasing conflict in the rangelands centred around competing claims to land and its use, against a backdrop of dry seasons and changing socio-economics, are escalating leaseholders' fears and concerns about growing community demands for multiple rangeland use. Government approaches now focus on multiple use of rangelands, providing incentives or opportunities to develop alternative methods of use for rangeland resources. However, environmental barriers to sustainable land use and diverse perceptions of sustainability continue to create difficulties for developing effective policies and strategies for change. There is now an urgent need for a paradigm shift in attitudes towards rangelands that promotes more sustainable uses for the land, a greater equality in sharing resources and constructive integration of the values of all rangeland stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/431/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between Phytophthora cinnamomiand Acacia pulchella: consequences on ecology and epidemiology of the pathogen</field><field name="creator">Jayasekera, Arunodini Uthpalawanna</field><field name="description">Phytophthora cinnamomi is an important pathogen of many plant species in natural ecosystems and horticulture industries around the world. In Western Australia, a high proportion of native plant species are susceptible to P. cinnamomi attack. Acacia pulchella, a resistant legume species native to Western Australia has been considered as a potential biological control tool against P. cinnamomi. To develop effective control methods, it is important to understand the interactions between the control agent and the different life forms of the pathogen. In this thesis the interactions are investigated between P. cinnamomi and varieties of A. pulchella which occur in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest and sand plain ecosystems.
 
 The soil inoculum of P. cinnamomi was compared under the potted plants of the three common varieties of A. pulchella, var. pulchella, var. glaberrima and var. goadbyi. These were grown in infected jarrah forest soil in the glasshouse and in vitro in a sterilised soil-less mix aseptically. Acacia urophylla (a species non suppressive towards P. cinnamomi) was also included as a control. An isolate of the most commonly found clonal lineage of P. cinnamomi in the jarrah forest, A2 type 1 was selected for use in experiments after testing showed it reliably produced zoospores and chlamydospores both axenically and in non-sterile conditions, in comparison to several other isolates. The lowest survival of P. cinnamomi inoculum was found under A. pulchella var. goadbyi plants grown both in non sterile soil and in aseptic soil-less mix.
 
 All the life forms of P. cinnamomi were affected by A. pulchella (Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5). The soil leachates from potted plants of A. pulchella var. goadbyi reduced sporangial production (Chapter 2) and caused cytoplasm collapse of chlamydospores (Chapter 3). The confirmation was obtained that soil under A. pulchella was inhibitory to sporangial stage of P. cinnamomi and new evidence was obtained on chlamydospore inactivation. Cytoplasm collapse in the chlamydospores was observed both for chlamydospores on mycelial discs on Mira cloth exposed to the soil leachate and within infected roots buried in soils under the three varieties of A. pulchella plants. The effect was strongest under the plants of A. pulchella var. goadbyi and indicated that the chlamydospores of P. cinnamomi are unlikely to act as persistent structures under A. pulchella var. goadbyi plants.
 
 In Chapter 4, bioassays were conducted with axenically produced mycelia, chlamydospores and zoospores to test the inhibitory effect of the root exudates collected from aseptically grown A. pulchella var. goadbyi plants. The zoospores of the same isolate used in the soil leachate tests were immobilised (became sluggish and encysted) within one to two minutes. When incubated for 24 h, zoospores predominantly clumped and germ tubes were observed only from the clumped ones. Chlamydospores produced by four isolates of the common A2 type 1 strain and the only one A2 type 2 strain  available at the time were tested. A higher percentage of chlamydospores collapsed and a very low percentage germinated after 24 h. Chlamydospores of all the A2 type 1 isolates were inhibited by the root exudates whilst the A2 type 2 isolate remained viable. The findings showed that the suppressive effect must be due at least in part to substances exuded by the A. pulchella plants. However, it appeared that the A2 type 1 isolates were more vulnerable to this effect than the single A2 type 2 isolate.
 
 In Chapter 5, the effect of season on sporangial suppression of P. cinnamomi was shown using field soils collected from three jarrah forest soil vegetation types and a Banksia woodland on Bassendean sand, collected in winter and summer. The effect of age of A. pulchella plants was demonstrated using the soils collected from rehabilitated bauxite mine pits. In all the locations soils were collected under A. pulchella plants and 5 m away from the nearest A. pulchella. An effect of soil type was evident as whilst the soil leachates made from the three lateritic jarrah forest soil types where A. pulchella is common in the understorey were suppressive to the sporangial stage of P. cinnamomi, this effect was not evident in the Bassendean sand under A. pulchella. A. pulchella soils collected in winter were less suppressive towards sporangial production than soils collected in summer. An effect of plant age was demonstrated as soil leachates from four year-old A. pulchella stands in rehabilitated bauxite mine sites were more suppressive for sporangia than leachates from one year-old stands.
 
 Further information on the behaviour of the pathogen in soil and in potting mix with and without A. pulchella was obtained by infecting lupin radicles with an isolate of each A2 type, 1 and 2 strains of P. cinnamomi and burying them in the soil under the three varieties of A. pulchella plants. After a week, the chlamydospores were mostly collapsed and hyphae deteriorated. Oospores were observed and in significant numbers under the potted plants of A. pulchella var. glaberrima.
 
 Isolates of all three clonal lineages of P. cinnamomi found in Australian soil were tested for the ability to produce oospores. Two isolates of the A1 and A2 type 2 and three isolates of the common A2 type 1 were screened. The two isozyme types of the A2 clonal lineage isolated in Australia varied in ability to self and produce oospores in planta in several soils from the jarrah forest. The isozyme type 2 of the A2 clonal lineage of P. cinnamomi produced oospores under these experimental conditions. This stimulation was not effective for most of the tested isolates of the A2 type 1 and the A1 clonal lineage. The in planta oospores were viable but dormant and the oogonial-antheridial associations were amphigynous both in vitro and in vivo. For the first time it was established that, the stimulus for selfing and oospore formation in the A2 type 2 of P. cinnamomi is available in some jarrah forest soils, with and without A. pulchella and also in the potting mix used. This raises important questions for the management of the pathogen.
 
 Several factors were identified as potential stimuli for selfing. Among them, soil nutrient levels and essentially enhanced sulphur presence were found important.  Temperature also played a key role. Oospores were produced abundantly at 21 - 25 degrees C but not over 28 degrees C.
 
 The biology of P. cinnamomi has been studied for several decades but some important aspects remain un-researched. This thesis pioneers research into the in planta selfing aspect of the pathogen in soil. It also improved the understanding of the interactions between P. cinnamomi and A. pulchella which to some extent supports use of A. pulchella as a biological control tool against P. cinnamomi. However, attention is drawn to the natural mechanisms of this complex pathogen to survive in planta by producing oospores, the most persistent form of its life cycle.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/432/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge management strategic alignment in the banking sector at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries</field><field name="creator">Al-Ammary, Jaflah Hassan</field><field name="description">An alignment or 'fit' between an organization's objectives and knowledge management (KM) practices should be established in order for the organization to fully utilize its knowledge assets and to derive competitive advantages. The organization should deploy a holistic approach for KM that spans business strategy, information system (IS) strategy, organization culture, and human factors. This research has investigated the strategic alignment between knowledge strategy and business strategy - KMBS-SA and the strategic alignment between knowledge strategy and IS strategy - KMIS-SA in the banking sector among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Using the proposed model, the study explored the impacts of KMBS-SA and KMIS-SA on the organizational performance. The main hypothesis of this research is that knowledge is the main resource in an organization, and by aligning this resource with the business strategy and IS strategy, the alignment will contribute positively on the performance of the organization.
 
 The research model was illustrated in two different conceptualizations hypothesizing the different relationships between knowledge strategies, business strategy and IS strategy. The first conceptualization illustrates the KMBS-SA and KMIS-SA, and an investigation on the contribution of theses alignments on the organizational performance.  The second conceptualization of the research model aims at investigating the impact of different types or profiles of KMBS-SA and KMIS-SA on the organizational performance. This study examined different alignments between two profiles of knowledge strategy - Aggressive Knowledge Strategy (AKS) and Conservative Knowledge Strategy (CKS), with various types of business strategy according to Miles and Snow's (1978) strategic typology, and, the alignment of the two profiles of knowledge strategy with various IS strategy based on the STROIS approach by Chan et al. (1997). Using both conceptualizations, the role of knowledge strategy as a moderator or a mediator in the contribution of the business strategy and IS strategy towards the organizational performance was examined. The primary data for this study was collected through a survey of 106 banks from the six Gulf countries: Kingdom of Bahrain, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Oman. The first overall conclusion demonstrated that there is a strong association between knowledge strategy and business strategy and that KMBS-SA clearly influenced the organizational performance. The second overall result of this research shows that in the context of GCC countries, knowledge strategy received stronger support as moderator of the IS congruence association with performance and that KMIS-SA is the primary determinant of the effectiveness of IS in the GCC banks.
 
 From the finding, it is recommended that the GCC banks should take KMBS-SA and KMIS-SA challenge seriously and should consider the alignment implication before moving ahead to implement a strategic plan. Furthermore, the research finding revealed that GCC bank should not ignore the different dimensions of knowledge strategic choices. The banks need to determine different profiles for their knowledge strategy in order to support all aspects of business strategy and IS strategic dimensions that are most important for the organization. They should then direct the organizational knowledge resources to support these profiles. Finally, it is recommended that the banks should define and establish a position in KM in order to oversee the knowledge strategy and KM issues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/433/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatty acid composition of pollen and the effect of two dominant fatty acids (linoleic and oleic) in pollen and flour diets on longevity and nutritional composition of honey bees (apis mellifera)</field><field name="creator">Manning, Robert</field><field name="description">The size of the apiculture industry in Western Australia (W.A.) is one of the smallest in the nation but the production of pollen and honey per colony is the highest in Australia. The overwhelming value of the bee industry to the community is through pollination. The pollination service benefit provided by honey bees (Apis mellifera) in Australia has an estimated value of $AUS1.7 billion (1999 - 2000). The economic yields from crops, such as almonds and cucurbits, depend entirely on the activity of honey bees. 
 
 Access to flora is essential to maintain productive colonies for pollination services. Pollen and nectar from flowers provide the nutritional components for colonies of honey bees to breed, but pollen is more important as it provides the colony with its source of protein. Protein content is changed by pollen lipid content which can vary from 0.8 to 18.9 %. Lipids are composed of fatty acids and a number are highly antimicrobial and play an important role in colony hygiene, whilst others are nutritionally crucial for honey bee development.
 
 Australian honey bee colonies utilise areas of native flora where a diversity of pollen species exist or hives are placed with agricultural crops that are based on European plants grown in monocultures, e.g. canola. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, in terms of breeding bees, some pollen species are much better than others and that bee health and longevity can be compromised if pollen is derived from single plant species. Protein analysis of pollen has been conducted on a wide range of species over the last two decades. However, lipid content and its analysis for fatty acids, which was reviewed for this thesis, have only been conducted on a few species. An initial investigation into the fatty acid composition of the pollen of W.A. eucalypts revealed the genus was characteristically high in linoleic acid concentration and ranged from 35.7 - 48 % (2.77 - 5.81 mg/g). Of the six species that are important to W.A. beekeepers, Eucalyptus wandoo (whitegum) and E. accedens (Powderbark Wandoo), a taxonomically similar species, showed similar levels of arachidic acid, whilst all three E. wandoo flowering varieties (summer, winter and spring) were the lowest in linolenic acid. Corymbia calophylla (redgum) was significantly higher in myristic and linolenic acids and E. patens (blackbutt), E. marginata (jarrah) and E. diversicolor (karri) had similar fatty acid profiles. European honey bees have evolved with plant species that have pollen that contain much higher levels of lipids, which are dominated by linolenic acid, than eucalypts. By contrast, the pollen of eucalypts, the most targeted plants by W.A. beekeepers, and other Australian plants are typically higher in linoleic than linolenic acid.
 
 Given the influence of lipids on protein content and that fatty acid concentration varied amongst some of the important eucalypt species, a much wider study of pollen from plant species that are important to beekeepers was conducted. The first aim of the project, a national pollen survey, was undertaken in which 577 samples of pollen were collected. A total of 73 different fatty acids were identified. Of these, only five: palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic were common to all 577 samples of pollen. The second aim of the thesis was to investigate the effect of two commonly found fatty acids in pollen and their concentration at which longevity and life-span of honey bees, and development of the hypopharyngeal gland were deleteriously affected. An associated objective was to determine whether a range of soya bean flours, the main ingredient of an artificial bee diet that can replace pollen but differs in lipid concentration, had a similar effect. The aim encompassed two projects. In the first, two fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acid) were added at concentrations from 0 to 16 % to the low-fat, bee-collected pollen from C. calophylla. Eight different lipid-enhanced diets were created and each fed to bees confined in cages (mini-colonies containing 1400 bees). Oleic and linoleic acids were chosen because they are two of the five commonly found fatty acids in pollen. Oleic acid is the dominant fatty acid in honey bees and is a monounsaturated fatty acid. Linoleic acid is a dominant fatty acid in eucalypt pollen and is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is one of two essential fatty acids that has antimicrobial activity.
 
 The second project revolved around the problem of maintaining bee populations when apiaries are in environments that lack floral abundance due to drought or other environmental catastrophes. In these situations, beekeepers maintain their colonies by supplying artificial feedstuffs to colonies of bees. The high-protein diet ingredient of choice is imported soya bean flour and three flours containing 0.6 % (protein concentrate), 1.8 % (defatted) and 18.9 % (full-fat) lipid, were used. Locally milled lupin flour, containing 6.9 % lipid, was tested as a possible replacement for imported soya bean flour. As for soya bean flour, lupin flour was used in pure form or mixed with pollen in diets fed to bees. Flour and pollen combinations created another ten different diets fed to bees the same way as the fatty acid-enhanced pollen diets.
 
 Along with the 8 lipid-enhanced and 10 flour and flour-pollen diets, there were two sugar-only diets, one mixed from dry cane sugar and the other, a liquid invert sugar. Two redgum pollen-only diets concluded the suite of 22 diets tested. One of these pollen diets was crushed and irradiated and was several years old whilst the other was collected fresh at the beginning of experimentation and kept frozen. Crushed and irradiated pollen is in common use by Australian commercial beekeepers as feedback when conditions for floral abundance are adverse.
 
 An early experimental result was an observation of distinctive bee behaviour after bees were confined in cages for six weeks where small but persistent numbers of bees were found hairless in samples. The behaviour was apparently the same as when single cohorts of emerged bees rearrange their caste repertoire, which has been reported elsewhere, but where no connection to head weight and caste type had been documented. Low head weight and hairlessness were strongly associated with each other. Low head weights are usually associated with foraging honey bees because the hypopharyngeal gland is no longer developed functionally.
 
 Experimentally, bees were assessed for longevity to 22 different diets in 7 experiments. Laboratory analysis was conducted on the weekly samples of bees removed from cages where bees were measured for head weight (hypopharyngeal gland development) and nutritional status by analysing de-gutted bees for protein, lipid, mineral and fatty acid content. Of the 22 diets tested, pure redgum pollen diets gave the greatest life-span and those bees fed diets of pure sugar had the shortest life. Honey bees fed a low-fat protein concentrate from soya bean flour had the longest life of the flours tested. Adding pollen to soya bean flour diets improved longevity whereas the addition of pollen to lupin flour caused increased mortality. Defatted and full-fat soya bean flours gave similar longevities and, despite large differences in fat content, the response to diet of head weight was negligible to the diets and no response was elicited by the queen bee to lay eggs which also indicated failed gland development of the worker bees.
 
 The addition of fatty acid (oleic and linoleic) to pollen at different concentrations caused significant differences in longevity. Overall, the addition of both fatty acids to pollen did not improve longevity. The addition of oleic acid to pollen greater than 2 % caused the longevity of bees to decrease, a poor head weight response and a failure of the queen to lay eggs. The addition of linoleic acid greater than 6 % to pollen diets had a similar response. As the percentage of oil was increased for both fatty acid additions, total consumption of the diet decreased.
 
 Honey bees fed soya bean, lupin flour and sugar-only diets failed to accumulate linoleic acid in their body which was in contrast to honey bees fed pollen diets. For the sugar diet, the failure of linoleic acid accumulation in bees occurred despite bees being able to accumulate total lipid. Manganese was poorly accumulated by honey bees fed both soya bean and lupin flour diets and a sugar-only diet. The implication is that linoleic acid and manganese need to be added separately to dietary formulations in a form as yet to be determined that will enable honey bees to accumulate these elements in the same way as bees do from consuming pollen.
 
 Soya bean flour-based diets, which have been used by beekeepers for decades, or lupin flour require additional amounts of linoleic acid and manganese. Similarly, this might apply to sugar. Sugar can be fed to bees in great quantities to enable bees to successfully over-winter in cold climates or it can allow breeding to commence which subsequently stimulates the collection of pollen. Sugar-feeding is widely promoted for orchard pollination, especially for kiwifruit. These changes could make these dietary ingredients more effective in enabling bees to breed between nectar flows and be more productive or nutritionally healthier, but any changes would require further cage experimentation. Bee-collected pollen naturally high in concentrations of oleic acid should also be tested in longevity trials, in conjunction with pollen that is low in oleic acid. The three untested common fatty acids (stearic, palmitic and linolenic acid) should also be evaluated for honey bee longevity and nutritional status.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/434/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational learning: an exploration of learning strategy practices in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Arshad, Mohd Anuar</field><field name="description">This study explores the Malaysian understanding and definition of the concept and terminology of organisational learning (OL) as well as the learning strategies and practices Malaysian organisations use to implement learning. As part of Malaysia's Vision 2020, the government has made a substantial and public commitment to promoting organisational learning to assist industry move to a first world economy status. A number of authors have defined organisational learning as a process of knowledge acquisition that involves continuous change to create, acquire, and transfer knowledge (Garvin 1993; Miller 1996; Williams 2001).  The objective is to explore if this conceptualisation has been accepted and implemented within Malaysia and if not, where opportunities exist to improve both the understanding and practice of Organisational Learning.  
 
 The study explores the understanding of OL and the learning strategies practiced by Malaysian organisations.  In-depth interviews were conducted among human resources managers, executives, professors and lecturers from the manufacturing, health, government and academic sectors in Malaysia. The information gathered was analysed using Nudist (v6) software to interrogate and explore similarities and differences in responses within and across the sectors. Trends emerging from the data were drawn together to present a picture of what happens in practice and to identify opportunities to improve and better manage the implementation of organisational learning and knowledge management strategies.
 
 The results suggest Malaysian industry representatives were, in general, able to define OL as a concept, however there was variable evidence that it is being implemented effectively in organisations. The manufacturing respondents had a higher level of understanding of OL than other industries. In practice, learning strategies also vary; health organisations emphasize seminars and conferences, the manufacturing sector emphasizes experiential learning, government departments focus more on attachment and exposure, whereas academic respondents were more reliant on self-learning. Overall, the most popular learning strategy is structured training and development programs, which suggests more needs to be done to inculcate learning strategies within the various industries. Those industries with stronger implementation patterns favoured a specialist department to provide a hub for handling knowledge and skills acquisition, for both internal and external learning sources.  In contrast, the understanding of knowledge management was much lower, and indeed, the term was unfamiliar to some respondents.
 
 These findings may be limited due to the small size of the sample and the findings being from a management perspective.  Nonetheless, given the government's strong commitment to organisational learning and the current lack of empirical industry studies within Malaysia, this study serves as a benchmark.  It does identify that the uptake of OL is still relatively limited and more needs to be achieved to promote a greater understanding of OL if it is to be successfully implemented in Malaysia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/435/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc application and its availability to plants</field><field name="creator">Brennan, Ross F.</field><field name="description">Globally, low zinc (Zn) soils are widespread, but one of the largest expanses of such soils is in south west Australia (WA). Early Zn research in the region determined how much fertiliser Zn was required for profitable production of spring wheat (Triticium aestivum L.) and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneanum L), the major crop and pasture species at the time. The research showed that Zn sulfate and ZnO were equally effective Zn fertilisers, but ZnO was cheaper and so was widely used. The research indicated that in the year of application, depending on soil type, between 0.5-1.5 kg Zn/ha provided adequate Zn for the production of wheat and subterranean clover. The length of time that a single application of Zn fertiliser remains fully effective in maintaining the production of crops and pasture in future years (residual value; (RV)) had not been determined. This knowledge of the RV of Zn fertilisers is required for soils of WA. The experiments that measured the RV of fertiliser Zn for spring wheat and subterranean clover form the bulk of this thesis.
 
 The soils in the region were also initially acutely phosphorus (P) deficient requiring the application of fertiliser P for profitable production. Single superphosphate was the P fertiliser initially used. It was manufactured locally using phosphate rock imported from Nauru and Christmas Islands. This phosphate rock also contained much Zn, and the single superphosphate manufactured from it contained 400-600 mg Zn/kg. At amounts of application needed to provide adequate P, the Zn-contaminated superphosphate also supplied about 90 g Zn/ha. Therefore, early field experiments measured the RV of ZnO applied to soil when single superphosphate was applied annually at &gt;150 kg/ha. In these experiments, the RV of Zn was measured when different amounts of fertiliser nitrogen (N) was applied. This was because it has recently been very profitable to apply fertiliser N to wheat crops, which greatly increased grain yields and so may have increased the demand for Zn, thereby probably decreasing the RV of the original ZnO application. In these experiments, there were many nil-Zn plots. In subsequent years, freshly-applied ZnO amounts were applied to measure the RV of the original ZnO treatments relative to the fresh Zn treatment. No Zn deficiency was detected for up to 23 years after applying ZnO while applying superphosphate at &gt;150 kg/ha per year and for all amounts of N applied.
 
 Subsequently cheap imported DAP fertiliser was used for wheat crops instead of locally produced Zn-contaminated single superphosphate and urea. The imported DAP contained about 50 mg Zn/kg (1/12 that of single superphosphate). This new fertiliser strategy induced Zn deficiency in many wheat crops. This led to further field studies to determine the RV of ZnO fertiliser when DAP was applied. The experiments also included 2 Zn-contaminated single superphosphate treatments. In one, no ZnO was applied, and superphosphate was applied at &gt;150 kg/ha per year to match the amount of P applied as DAP to the other treatments. The other treatment was the same, except 1.5 kg/ha Zn as ZnO was applied in the first year only. In subsequent years, freshly-applied ZnO amounts were applied to measure the RV of the original ZnO treatments relative to the fresh Zn treatment. Relative to freshly-applied Zn in each year, the RV of the original ZnO treatments decreased as the length of time that the Zn was in contact with soil increased. However, the rate of decline in the RV was also found to differ with soil type, and was affected by soil pH, clay and organic carbon content of soil, and in alkaline soils with the calcium carbonate content of soil. 
 
 Parallel glasshouse studies measured the RV of Zn, as Zn sulfate, for wheat and subterranean clover, using many soils from WA and other Australian States. The glasshouse studies also showed that the rate of decline in the RV of the original Zn application varied markedly with soil type and was strongly influenced by soil pH, clay and organic carbon content of soil, and in the alkaline soils, the amount of calcium carbonate in soil.
 
 In the above studies, the RV of fertiliser Zn was measured relative to freshly-applied Zn using yield of plants (shoots and grain for wheat, shoots for clover), Zn content in shoots and grain, and soil test Zn using the ammonium oxalate and DTPA procedures. In addition, Zn concentration in young tissue and rest of shoots (glasshouse studies) and young tissue and whole shoots (field studies) was measured, and Zn concentration related to 90 % of the maximum yield (critical Zn in plant parts) was determined. The studies showed that the DTPA soil test procedure, together with soil pH, and clay and organic matter content of soil, was an accurate prognostic test for indicating when Zn deficiency was likely in the next clover or wheat crop. The study confirmed that young tissue (youngest fully expanded leaves) provided critical plant test values for diagnosing Zn deficiency in plants. The plant and soil tests for Zn are now used by commercial soil and tissue testing laboratories.
 
 When Zn deficiency was diagnosed early in field grown wheat, Zn sprays can be applied to the crop foliage to prevent or minimise decreases in grain yields at the end of the growing season. Zn sulfate and Zn chelate are the most widely used compounds. This thesis reports the results of a field study to compare the effectiveness of the two compounds when the spray was applied at two growth stages of wheat (Gs14; seedling growth and Gs24; tillering). In addition, Zn applied with the seed while sowing the wheat crop was also included. Zinc applied to the soil while sowing was the most effective treatment. Zn chelate was more effective as a spray than Zn sulfate when applied at the earlier growth stage, but Zn sulfate was cheaper, and both sprays were equally effective when applied at the later growth stage.
 
 Recently in the region, durum wheat (T. durum L.), narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.), yellow lupin (L. luteus L.), white lupin (L. albus L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik) were all increasingly grown in rotation with spring wheat. Consequently, the Zn requirement of the new crops was compared with the Zn requirements of spring wheat. Species requiring less Zn than spring wheat to produce the same relative yield were faba bean, chickpea, albus lupin and canola; species requiring more Zn were lentil and durum wheat. 
 
 Spreadsheet models were developed to determine when re-application of fertiliser Zn was required for low and high production systems. Relative to freshly-applied Zn, the rate of decline in the RV of Zn applied in a previous year varied depending on the amount of Zn applied, time the Zn was in contact with soil since application, properties of the soil (soil pH, % clay, % organic carbon, % free calcium carbonate), plant species, and the amount of Zn removed in harvested grain or hay.
 
 The thesis has culminated in a better understanding of Zn in the agricultural production systems of WA. The distribution and correction of Zn deficiency is now predictable for the many soil types and cropping systems of WA. Accurate identification of Zn deficiency for a range of crop and pasture species by plant analyses, typically the youngest mature leaf, is now possible for local conditions. With the calibration of the DTPA Zn soil test for soils of WA, particularly for wheat the major crop species grown in WA, prognosis of potential Zn deficiency can now be predicted before the appearance of Zn deficiency or loss in plant production.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/436/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological and behavioural responses of sheep exposed to heat load within intensive sheep industries</field><field name="creator">Stockman, Catherine Ann</field><field name="description">The live export and feedlotting industries are the major intensive sheep industries in Australia. During live shipment, sheep are exposed to prolonged periods of high heat and humidity, with little relief for several days, while environmental conditions in a Western Australian sheep feedlot have not yet been assessed. The research described in this thesis was conducted to determine the physiological responses of sheep to conditions within the live export and feedlotting industries, with particular focus on that of heat stress.
 
 Merino wethers and Awassi rams developed significant change in physiological variables when exposed to prolonged periods of high heat and humidity, such as during long haul, live export voyages to the Northern Hemisphere. Physiological changes such as increased core temperature, respiratory rate, panting score and associated changes in blood gas variables were apparent in Merino wethers. However, Awassi rams showed exceptional ability to maintain homeostasis under the same environmental conditions, with no significant changes in core temperature and only slight alteration in blood gas variables. Results from this study indicated that electrolyte supplementation of sheep during live export would not be warranted because plasma electrolytes did not drastically change and blood gas variables quickly returned to normal following the heat.
 
 Further studies developed methods to determine the critical wet bulb temperature, otherwise known as the heat stress threshold (HST) of Merino rams, ram lambs and wethers exposed to live export conditions. These studies found that ram lambs had a lower HST than both adult rams and wethers. However, both adult rams and wethers had a similar HST. Heat stress thresholds determined from these studies have been used in a model to predict high risk shipments for particular classes of sheep (Stacey 2003).
 
 This thesis also details the environmental conditions within a Western Australian summer feedlot and the physiological responses of cross bred ewes and wethers to these conditions when fed feedlot rations. This study found that temperatures in a typical Western Australian feedlot in summer increased above 40 degrees C with low humidity; however, temperatures generally decreased to be within the sheep's thermoneutral zone at night. Both ewes and wethers had significantly increased core temperatures in response to these conditions, with sheep spending significantly more time in the shade than in the sun during the day. Both ewes and wethers had increased respiratory rates and panting scores during an intensive climate room experiment with similar environmental conditions. However, feed intake did not decrease even when climate room temperatures increased at night and humidity levels were higher than that found in typical feedlot conditions in Western Australia. 
 
 Work completed within this thesis has led to a greater understanding of the physiological responses of sheep to prolonged and continuous high heat such as during live export and to conditions of a typical Western Australian summer feedlot. This research has set a foundation for further study of management of sheep during live export and feedlotting.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/437/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of recombinant vaccines against Jembrana disease</field><field name="creator">Ditcham, William</field><field name="description">Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a lentivirus causing an acute infection with a 17% case fatality rate in Bali cattle in Indonesia. Control of the disease is currently achieved by identification of infected areas and restriction of cattle movement. A detergent-inactivated whole virus tissue-derived vaccine is sometimes employed in affected areas.
 
 This thesis reports initial attempts to produce genetically engineered vaccines to replace the inactivated tissue-derived vaccine, which as it is made from homogenised spleen of infected animals, is expensive to produce and could contain adventitious agents present in the donor animals.
 
 4 potential DNA vaccine constructs were created containing the JDV genes coding for the Tat, capsid (CA), transmembrane (TM) and surface unit (SU) proteins in a commercially available vaccine plasmid. These were assessed for functionality in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays. All proteins were expressed in vitro and administration of 2 of the constructs by a commercial 'gene gun' into the epidermis of mice resulted in antibody production to the appropriate protein. Due to the difficulties of licensing such a DNA vaccine in Indonesia, these vaccines were not progressed further.
 
 A mathematical model was developed to describe the progression of the acute phase of Jembrana disease following experimental infection with JDV. The model divided the disease into 6 phases based on the rates of viral replication and clearance calculated from data on sequential plasma viral RNA load detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. This allowed statistical comparison of each phase of the disease and comparison of the severity of the disease process in groups of animals. The use of the model overcame the difficulty of comparing the disease in different animals as a consequence of the animal-to-animal variation in the disease process.
 
 The mathematical model was used to identify differences in the pathogenicity of 2 strains of JDV. One strain, JDVTAB caused a more rapid onset of disease in non-vaccinated controls, a significantly higher virus load at the onset of the febrile period and a higher peak viraemia than in animals infected with JDVPUL. This provided the first evidence of variation in pathogenicity of JDV strains.
 
 The measurement of virus load also demonstrated that some JDV infected animals developed a clinical disease that was not typical of that which had been reported previously. When infected with less than 1,000 infectious virus particles, up to 20% of infected animals failed to develop a febrile response. Infection of these animals was confirmed, however, by the detection of a high titre of circulating virus particles in plasma. These atypical infections had not been reported previously.
 
 Application of the mathematical model describing the progression of the disease in individual animals was used to examine the effect of vaccination with the inactivated tissue-derived vaccine on the progression of the disease. Several effects were noted in vaccinated animals that were subsequently infected with JDV: a reduction in the duration of the febrile response, a reduction in the severity of the febrile response in the early phases of the acute disease, and a reduction in virus load in the early and later phases of the disease process.
 
 The effect of vaccination with recombinant Tat, matrix (MA) and CA protein vaccines expressed in a bacterial expression system on subsequent JDV infection was also examined. A vaccine incorporating recombinant Tat and CA vaccine emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant decreased the febrile response particularly in the later stages of the acute disease process, decreased the severity of the leucopenia in the later phases of the acute disease, and decreased the virus load in some but not all phases of the acute disease process. Vaccines administered with Freund's incomplete adjuvant were more efficacious than vaccines administered with QuilA, the latter actually exacerbating the disease process in vaccinated animals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/438/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Localised splitting criteria for classification and regression trees</field><field name="creator">Bremner, Alexandra</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a modification of existing entropy-based splitting criteria for classification and regression trees. Trees are typically grown using splitting criteria that choose optimal splits without taking future splits into account. This thesis examines localised splitting criteria that are based on local averaging in regression trees or local proportions in classification trees. The use of a localised criterion is motivated by the fact that future splits result in leaves that contain local observations, and hence local deviances provide a better approximation of the deviance of the fully grown tree. While most recent research has focussed on tree-averaging techniques that are aimed at taking a moderately successful splitting criterion and improving its predictive power, this thesis concentrates on improving the splitting criterion.
 
 Use of a localised splitting criterion captures local structures and enables later splits to capitalise on the placement of earlier splits when growing a tree. Using the localised splitting criterion results in much simpler trees for pure interaction data (data with no main effects) and can produce trees with fewer errors and lower residual mean deviances than those produced using a global splitting criterion when applied to real data sets with strong interaction effects.
 
 The superiority of the localised splitting criterion can persist when multiple trees are grown and averaged using simple methods. Although a single tree grown using the localised splitting criterion can outperform tree averaging using the global criterion, generally improvements in predictive performance are achieved by utilising the localised splitting criterion's property of detecting local discontinuities and averaging over sets of trees grown by placing splits where the deviance is locally minimal. Predictive performance improves further when the degree of localisation of the splitting criterion is randomly selected and weighted randomisation is used with locally minimal deviances to produce sets of trees to average over. Although state of the art methods quickly average very large numbers of trees, thus making the performance of the splitting criterion less critical, predictive performance when the localised criterion is used in bagging indicates that different splitting methods warrant investigation.
 
 The localised splitting criterion is most useful for growing one tree or a small number of trees to examine structure in the data. Structurally different trees can be obtained by simply splitting the data where the localised splitting criterion is locally optimal.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/440/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular epidemiology, clonality and virulence of Dichelobacter nodosus, the agent of ovine footrot</field><field name="creator">Buller, Nicky</field><field name="description">Dichelobacter nodosus, an anaerobic bacterium, is the major transmissible agent of ovine footrot. The disease expresses as a virulent or benign lesion in the hoof. Virulence is related to the production of serine proteases, particularly a thermostable protease. Isolates of D. nodosus are characterised according to the type of protease produced (either heat-stable or heat-labile) and the electrophoretogram (zymogram) of the protease. This study reports on the use of the DNA-based typing techniques Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Infrequent-Restriction-Site-PCR (IRS-PCR) to investigate the molecular epidemiology of D. nodosus, including a consideration of the relationship between genetic type, zymogram patterns and whole cell protein profiles.
 
 The aim of the project was to obtain a better understanding of D. nodosus strain diversity and dissemination in Australia and its relationship to virulence within the population. The overall intention was to use this information to assist in the long-term control of virulent footrot.
 
 Field isolates of D. nodosus from Western Australia (n = 735), New South Wales (n = 16), Victoria (n = 24) and South Australia (n = 21) were obtained and analysed. Both typing techniques that were used offered good differentiation between isolates for epidemiological purposes, and the results were in general agreement. PFGE provided slightly better discrimination between isolates, with 214 PFGE types (181 from Western Australia) compared to 94 IrsT types (77 from Western Australia). Within this diverse range of molecular types clonality was observed - with clones being defined as clusters of isolates having closely related PFGE types. The strains were categorised as genetically diverse, genetically similar or identified as the same strain. This diversity of genetic types was found overall, within flocks of sheep on a farm and within a single hoof where, on a number of occasions, multiple molecular types and zymogram types were found colonising a single hoof. One isolate that was experimentally inoculated into a flock of sheep produced six different genetic types when tested 12 months after the initial infection. This indicates that D. nodosus undergoes rapid genetic change, which means that follow-up epidemiological investigation of disease outbreaks and trace-backs need to be done as soon after infection as possible. The genetic differences appeared to be due to large insertions or deletions of DNA.
 
 Amongst sheep on some properties, isolates that had a different protease expression and virulence expression were found to have the same molecular type. Investigation of these isolates by SDS-PAGE showed that they also had the same whole cell protein profiles. Isolates from the same clonal groups also had the same protein profile, whereas genetically diverse isolates had different protein profiles. The lack of protein differences between isolates of the same molecular type, or within a clonal group, suggests that the differences in protease thermostability may be due to conformational changes in the protein, rather than to overall detectable genetic change and/or expression of different proteins. These results demonstrate that PFGE typing can be useful in predicting likely phenotypic expression of whole cell proteins. Further work is required to elucidate differences between virulent and benign strains of D. nodosus.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/441/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The granule-bound starch synthase genes of wheat</field><field name="creator">Bradley, Bernadette</field><field name="description">Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the world's most widely grown and economically important crop. It is both a staple food for humans and a raw material for many industrial processes. World trade in wheat is important for economic stability and an ability to grow wheat is a valuable national resource. Wheat is Australia's major crop with an annual production of about 23 million tonnes.
 
 One-quarter of this is used domestically and meets all of Australia's requirements; the remaining three-quarters is exported. Therefore, Australia's wheat industry provides both the national staple food source and the basis of an export industry worth almost 2 billion dollars.
 
 There is great potential for further genetic improvement of wheat, not only by increasing grain yields by improved resistance to pathogens and tolerance to adverse environmental conditions, but also by improving functional quality. For example, one can change the physical properties of the storage components, starch and protein, to increase their usefulness in conventional applications and for novel uses. Some examples of the physical properties of starch affecting its uses are, the large starch granules from wheat that are suitable to make carbonless copy paper (Bligh, 1999), the small starch granules from rice that are used as a fat substitute because the a comparable mouthfeel, the high-amylose starches that have film-forming properties desirable for fried food coating batters and some forms of plastics, and the low-amylose starch that swells more in water and can be used for soft foods such as Asian noodles. Continued improvement of wheat is vital to meet the quantity and quality demands of the local and international wheat markets.
 
 One specialty market for Western Australian wheat, is export to Japan and South Korea for the production of Japanese white salted Udon noodles, an export market worth more than $200M pa (Garlinge, 1996). Udon noodles have specific eating qualities including a light, creamy, uniform colour, a 'bright' appearance to the noodle, a soft but elastic texture to the noodle, and a smooth 'mouthfeel', all of which result from the quality of the wheat flour starch they are made from(Crosbie, 1991; Batey et al., 1997; Zeng et al., 1997). The Australian Standard White Noodle (ASWN) wheat that Australia exports to produce Udon noodles is soft-grained, white coloured, contains between 9.5% and 11.5% protein, and produces flour of fine particle size with little starch damage (V. Reck, DAWA, pers. comm.). The flour also has good starch-swelling characteristics, moderate dough strength and good dough extensibility.
 
 The good starch-swelling characteristics of the flour result, for the most-part, from containing relatively less of the starch amylose than other varieties (22-23% compared to 25%), a property controlled by the GBSS genes (Nelson and Rines, 1962; Garlinge, 1996). When less amylose is present in the starch granule as it is heated in water, the amylopectin matrix inside the granule can swell, causing the finished Udon noodle to be soft. When more amylose is present in the starch granule, the amylopectin matrix cannot swell as much, and the finished noodle is too hard to have the desired 'mouthfeel' of an Udon noodle. The amylose fraction of starch is produced by the granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) enzymes, encoded by the GBSS genes. The overall aim of the research described in this thesis was to investigate the genomic organization of the GBSS genes of wheat. Since the GBSS genes influence wheat starch quality, an understanding of the action of these genes is needed for future improvement of starch quality in noodle-wheats.
 
 There are three loci for GBSS genes in wheat, and these are located on chromosomes 4A, 7A and 7D. Both wild-type alleles and non-functional 'null' alleles exist at each locus. At the start of the project, these alleles had not been sequenced and the molecular differences between the alleles were not known. Other GBSS alleles were also thought to exist in Australian varieties that had yet to be identified and characterised. GBSS genes from a selection of wheat varieties, and from all three GBSS loci, were sequenced searching for DNA polymorphisms that were different between the different alleles. If any DNA polymorphisms were found to result in GBSS protein sequence differences, or differences in GBSS enzyme expression, they could influence the functional characteristics of the starch. Identifying GBSS allelic variants would enable molecular markers to be developed to detect the alleles and investigate their potential effects upon starch quality.
 
 Different PCR-based methods and one non-PCR-based method were used to investigate the genomic organization of the GBSS genes in a selection of genetically diverse wheat varieties. The 31 wheat varieties studied included noodle-wheat varieties from the ASWN classification, varieties with similar genetic background to ASWN wheat varieties but of unsuitable quality for noodle production, unrelated varieties of Australian Standard White wheat, and were compared with those 'Chinese Spring' varieties described in the literature. Most of the varieties are grown in the Western Australian wheatbelt and southern regions, either for export and the production of Asian noodles, or for the production of domestic baked-goods.
 
 A 500bp section from the middle of the GBSS genes was amplified, from a selection of wheat varieties, and sequenced to search for polymorphisms. Twenty-one single nucleotide differences were found between genes at the three loci and two PCR-based tests were designed to validate these differences as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). A novel microsatellite was also discovered in intron 4 of the GBSS 7A genes. This (TGCCG)n microsatellite was variable between wheat varieties and so defines a novel allele in the Australian germplasm present at a frequency of 40%. A PCR-based test was developed to identify this variable locus. However, the new GBSS allele was not linked to Flour Swelling Volume (FSV) quality properties.
 
 The variable microsatellite locus Xsun1 (Shariflou and Sharp, 1999) in the 3' untranslated region of the GBSS genes and linked to GBSS allelic variation was used to genotype a wheat breeding population for its GBSS status. The population (n=69) contained combinations of wild-type and null alleles at the 7A and 7D loci. Once genotyped using this marker, the GBSS alleles were assessed for possible likage to starch variation. Although the trend suggested that the presence ofnull alleles increased the FSV, the size of the population tested was too small for the differences in FSV between wild-type and partially-waxy wheats to be statistically significant.
 
 The linkage between the Xsun1 microsatellite variation and the (TGCCG)n microsatellite variation from intron 4 of the GBSS 7A genes was studied. By combining these two microsatellite loci, which are closely linked to the GBSS coding regions, GBSS genes at the 7A locus could be separated into 12 allelic groups. Although none of these groups could be linked to specific changes in starch qualities, they can be analysed further for functional differences.
 
 In order to access a larger section of the GBSS genes using PCR, new PCR primers were designed and optimized to amplify segments of the GBSS genes. Primers for GBSS genes tend to generate many PCR products, but many of these were shown to be non-specific. These artifacts could be reduced by increasing the annealing temperatures, and non-specific priming was repressed by the presence of the second primer in the PCR reaction. Using one primer set, a nearly 2000bp segment of the GBSS 7A genes from wheat varieties 'Kulin' and 'Eradu' was amplified and sequenced.
 
 These sequences indicated the presence of single nucleotide differences that resulted in changed amino acids in the protein when compared to published GBSS sequences. The sequencing should be repeated to validate this result, which indicates that these are novel alleles, but it does suggest that allelic variation for GBSS exists in Australian wheat varieties and that these alleles are different from those described internationally.
 
 The EcoR1, HindIII and BamH1 restriction enzyme sites surrounding the GBSS genes were identified using Southern hybridisation. This provided the potential to access the entire GBSS gene, including the promoter and untranscribed regions, by restriction enzyme mediated cloning of genomic DNA. However, attempts to clone the genomic GBSS genes into both plasmid and viral vectors were not successful.The potential existence of pseudogene copies of the GBSS genes in the wheat genome was investigated using both PCR and Southern hybridisation techniques. No evidence of GBSS pseudogenes was found, and this suggests that the wheat genome does not contain them. This result was unexpected since organisms with large genomes, such as wheat, normally contain repeated sequences and pseudogenes. However, the absence of repeated sequences and pseudogenes should be beneficial in molecular wheat breeding because it suggests that there will not be interference from non-coding GBSS sequences in identifying molecular markers to GBSS genes.
 
 The GBSS genes present in Australian wheat varieties were similar enough to those described internationally that Australian breeders can make full use of research and molecular tests for GBSS genes developed elsewhere. However, enough variation exists between overseas and domestic varieties to warrant further investigation of novel GBSS alleles in domestic wheat, which may relate to differences in functionality.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/442/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conventional and deep-litter pig production systems: the effects on fat deposition and distribution in growing female large white X landrace pigs</field><field name="creator">Trezona-Murray, Megan</field><field name="description">Minimising variability in carcass quality to better meet market specifications is a priority for Australian pig producers, however issues with variability in carcass fat distribution have recently been raised, particularly in the belly primal. There has been a rapid increase in the use of low-cost, deep-litter (DL) housing systems in Australia over the past 15 years for rearing pigs. The inherent differences between the physical, thermal, and social environments of conventional (C) and DL production systems may well alter the growth path of the pig and subsequently alter fat metabolism and hence fat deposition and distribution. The general industry view is that pigs finished in DL housing are fatter and grow less efficiently than pigs finished in C housing, however contrasting carcass and growth performance results have been reported between housing systems. It is likely that the different housing environments affect the maintenance energy requirements of the growing pig, thereby affecting the availability of substrates for fat deposition and/or the requirements for fat mobilisation. Hence, raising pigs in C and/or DL production systems was identified as a likely contributor to variability in carcass fat distribution via the effects of the disparate environments on fat metabolism.
 
 The overall purpose of this thesis was to establish the effect of keeping pigs in C and/or DL housing systems on fat metabolism, and therefore fat deposition in the growing pig and fat distribution in the finished carcass. Industry considers that finishing pigs in C facilities allows greater flexibility in feeding and marketing decisions, allowing growth efficiency and backfat to be managed more effectively than in a DL system. Therefore an aspect of this thesis was to also examine the effects of an alternative management strategy, raising pigs in a combination of DL and C housing, on growth performance and fat deposition and distribution in the carcass. The presence of straw bedding is a major difference between C and DL housing systems. This was identified as a probable contributor to the differences in growth performance and carcass fat distribution found between pigs raised in the different housing systems, via its thermal properties and/or the ingestion of the straw on pig growth.
 
 Experiment 1a and 1b were designed to test the hypothesis that the growth path differs for pigs raised in C and DL housing systems, affecting biochemical indicators of fat metabolism and therefore fat accretion and distribution in the carcass. The study was conducted as a serial slaughter of pigs housed in C and DL systems allowing the pattern of fat accretion, and therefore the distribution of fat in the carcass, to be determined from 15-185 kg live weight (LW). The results confirmed the hypothesis that the growth path, fat accretion and fat distribution in the carcass differed for pigs raised in C and DL housing systems.
 
 In Experiment 1a, elevated lipogenic enzyme activities, higher percentages of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and higher concentrations of plasma glucose and lactate indicated lipogenesis was elevated in C pigs to 13 weeks of age, compared to young DL pigs, suggesting that fat accretion was higher in young C pigs. At 24 weeks of age however there was a shift in lipogenic enzyme activities, the percentage of SFA in backfat and the concentration of plasma glucose were higher in DL-housed pigs than C-housed pigs, indicating higher rates of lipogenesis. Elevated concentrations of plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol in DL pigs indicated that lipolysis, or fat mobilisation, was higher in DL-housed pigs for the entire growth period. The results from Experiment 1b clearly indicated that during early growth, C pigs grew faster than DL pigs (0.71 vs 0.66 kg/day, P less then/= 0.05) and were heavier between 8-23 weeks of age (P less then/= 0.05). Therefore in conjunction with the results of Experiment 1a, it was expected that you ng C pigs would be fatter than DL pigs of the same age. However, dissection indicated no treatment differences in total carcass composition, although there was an effect of housing on carcass fat distribution with a trend (P=0.087) for a lower ratio of fat:lean in the belly primal of DL pigs compared to C pigs at 13 weeks of age. After 20 weeks of age however, growth rates were similar for pigs in both housing treatments and by 26 weeks of age there were no treatment differences in live weight (LW) but the rate of fat accretion in DL pigs, particularly in the loin and belly primals, increased rapidly. Differences in the thermal environments of C and DL housing, and therefore differences in the energy demand for thermoregulation, were likely to have contributed to the differences measured in lipogenesis, growth performance and carcass fat distribution.
 
 Experiment 2a and 2b tested the hypothesis that moving pigs from DL to C housing for finishing would improve overall growth performance and reduce carcass fatness compared to pigs raised in wean-to-finish DL housing. The biochemical measurements indicated few differences in the rate of lipogenesis between 13-week-old C and DL pigs. However, and in agreement with the findings from Experiment 1a, elevated plasma NEFA concentrations in DL pigs suggested higher rates of lipolysis. Up to 13 weeks of age, pigs in the DL housing system grew faster than C pigs, however similar to the findings of Experiment 1b, DL pigs were less efficient. In addition, P2 backfat depth was less in DL pigs, indicating they were leaner than C pigs, and though not reflected in total carcass composition, again there was an effect of housing on fat distribution. The move to an unfamiliar housing environment affected growth performance, reduced enzyme activity in backfat and the ratio of SFA in belly fat, suggesting these pigs had lower rates of lipogenesis. However in contrast to Experiment 1a, where lipogenesis was higher in older DL pigs compared to older C pigs, pigs finished in the DL housing had a trend for lower enzyme activity in belly fat (P=0.063), suggesting lower rates of lipogenesis, and higher plasma glycerol concentrations, suggesting a higher level of lipolysis compared to C-finished pigs. The carcass composition data (Experiment 2b) found that though there were no differences indicated by differences in P2 depth, there was a strong trend (P=0.057) for DL-finished pigs to have 2-6% less fat in the carcass as a result of significantly less fat in the shoulder (15% vs 17%) and belly (29% vs 33%) primals compared to C-finished pigs. The difference in belly primal composition was a reflection of the lower enzyme activities in belly fat and higher plasma glycerol concentrations in DL finished pigs. The results suggest that the type of housing during the finishing growth period has a greater impact on fat accretion and carcass composi ion than the type of housing during the grower period, or changing housing environment during growth. However, changing housing environment at 13 weeks of age affected growth, where there was a temporary reduction in daily LW gain, and therefore significantly lower (P less then/= 0.001) LW at slaughter (117 kg LW), compared to pigs that had remained in C or DL housing from wean-to-finish (123 kg LW). Moving pigs from DL to C housing to control carcass fat and improve growth performance compared to pigs grown wean-to-finish in DL housing, was not successful, and had a negative impact on performance and carcass quality by reducing growth efficiency and LW and increasing carcass fatness. The results also showed that contrary to the industry view that DL raised pigs are fatter, pigs in this experiment finished in DL housing had a lower fat:lean ratio in the carcass than pigs finished in the C system (P less then/= 0.05).
 
 The effects of straw on growth performance and carcass composition were evaluated in Experiment 3a and 3b by including straw in the grower and finisher diets (St+) and/or providing straw bedding (Bed+) to C-housed pigs. The experiment tested the hypothesis that the presence of straw alters the growth paths of pigs, affecting fat distribution in the carcass. Straw, as bedding and in the diet, affected pig growth paths and altered carcass fat distribution and, consistent with the findings for DL pigs in Experiments 1b and 2b, there was a trend for pigs with access to straw to have less fat in the belly (P=0.072).
 
 Elevated activity of key enzymes involved in lipogenesis, measured in Experiment 3a in belly fat and backfat from pigs fed the St+ diet, and a higher ratio of SFA in belly fat of pigs housed on concrete without straw bedding, suggested that in this experiment straw ingestion increased lipogenesis in belly fat and backfat of the growing pig, whilst straw bedding reduced lipogenesis in belly fat. Experiment 3b demonstrated an additive effect of straw on growth where average LW at slaughter for pigs without access to straw was significantly lower (110 kg), compared to pigs with access to one source of straw either via the diet or bedding (115 and 114 kg LW respectively), and pigs that had two sources of straw available (119 kg LW) (P less then/= 0.05). Although LW differed between treatments there were no differences in total carcass fat (P&gt;0.10), yet there was an effect of straw on fat distribution. Pigs with access to straw had a lower ratio of fat and a higher ratio of lean tissue in the belly primal (P=0.072) compared to pigs that did not have straw. The effect of straw ingestion on lipogenesis and fat deposition may have occurred via the effects of dietary fibre (DF) on the dilution of dietary energy density. Pigs were able to compensate for the energy/nutrient dilution by increasing VFI and therefore growth was not affected, however fat acts as an insulator, and localised differences in fat distribution may have been related to increased heat production (HP) from the digestion of greater volumes of feed. In response, fat deposition may have been directed away from the belly location in order to facilitate heat loss. Floor type may have also affected fat distribution via differences in thermal conductivity. Straw has a lower thermal conductivity than concrete, hence pigs housed on concrete flooring may have a greater requirement for fat in the belly to reduce conductive heat loss. Results from Experiment 3a and 3b provided evidence that pigs housed on bedding consume straw in sufficient quantities. Pigs fed the straw diet had significantly higher concentrations of plasma acetate than pigs fed the control diet (P less then/= 0.001), and there was a trend for pigs housed on straw bedding to have higher levels than pigs without access to straw. An increase in plasma acetate can indicate increased microbial activity in gut, which occurs in response to higher levels of DF. In addition, pigs bedded on straw had higher gastrointestinal tract weights, which can also indicate higher levels of DF intake. 
 
 Regression analyses of data across experiments showed that P2 backfat depth, the primary carcass composition prediction tool, accounted for less than 50% of the variation in percent carcass fat (R2=0.41). Furthermore, across experiments, P2 accounted for very little of the variability in percent belly fat (R2=0.01). These results highlight the inconsistency of P2 depth as a reliable indicator of carcass composition and the need for the development of additional criteria to be used in the selection of carcasses for specific markets as the composition of the belly primal was not indicated by the current carcass measurement system.
 
 From the results obtained in this thesis, it was proposed that:
 1) The growth path of pigs is altered by the housing system in which they are reared and the more variable ambient temperature of the DL housing system would increase the energy requirement of young pigs for thermoregulation. As a consequence of the altered growth paths, fat metabolism differs for pigs raised in DL and C production systems. Lower rates of lipogenesis may occur in young DL pigs compared to C pigs and this can change as pigs grow, however fat mobilisation remains higher in DL pigs during growth.
 
 2) Differences in the rate of lipogenesis, indicated by the biochemical measures, were generally not reflected in total carcass composition, however there were differences in carcass fat distribution where pigs raised in DL systems consistently had less fat in the belly primal. Rearing environment may provide an additional criterion when selecting carcasses for specific markets where variability in belly composition is an issue.
 
 3) Pig raised in the DL environment are not always fatter than pigs housed in C facilities, and moving pigs from one housing environment to another during the growing-finishing period disrupts the growth path reducing growth performance and can increase carcass fatness.
 
 4) Straw bedding, via ingestion and via its physical thermal properties, affects pig growth and fat distribution and may explain in-part the differences in pig growth performance and carcass quality found between C and DL housing systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/443/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of two haplosporidian parasites of oysters in north Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Bearham, Douglas</field><field name="description">A cryptic haplosporidian parasite was detected infecting rock oysters from the Montebello Islands in north-western Australia using a PCR targeting the parasite's small ribosomal subunit gene.  The PCR products were cloned and sequenced along with the remaining sections of the parasite's SSU rRNA gene.  Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence generated indicated a Minchinia species (Haplosporidia). The SSU sequence generated was used to develop two in situ hybridisation assays to visualise the parasite in H/E sections as well as a PCR assay to detect the parasite.  The molecular assays were assessed for specificity and sensitivity and were then used to compare the parasite to previous haplosporidian parasite infections of pearl oysters.  Both assays produced positive results from the infected pearl oysters but not from other closely related haplosporidian species.  An SEM and TEM electron microscopy analysis was performed on spores from both parasite species.  The spores of the pearl oyster parasite had two spore wall filaments wound around the spore originating for a posterior thickening while the spores of the rock oyster parasite were covered in microtubule-like structures.  These data suggests pearl oysters where co-infected with both the Haplosporidium sp. and the Minchinia sp. detected in rock oysters.  No evidence of a posterior thickening could be found on the spores of the rock oyster parasite.  Attempts to detect the parasite at the previous geographic sites of its detection in pearl oysters resulted in detection of the Minchinia species in tropical oysters in the Kimberley region of Western Australia by in-situ hybridisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/444/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Partial characterisation of pilchard herpesvirus and the associated disease in pilchards</field><field name="creator">Crockford, Melanie</field><field name="description">In 1995 and again in 1998, millions of pilchards (Sardinops sagax neopilchardus) were found dead or dying off the coast of Australia and also in New Zealand. The epizootics moved progressively, at a rapid speed against the prevailing currents. A previously unrecognised herpesvirus, Pilchard herpesvirus (PHV), was identified as the causative agent.
 
 Until recently, rapid and sensitive methods to detect PHV were not available and based on a previously identified and conserved 373 bp region of the genome, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridisation and real-time PCR methods were developed for the specific detection of PHV in formaldehyde-fixed and frozen tissues of pilchards. Real-time PCR was shown to have greater sensitivity than a conventional PCR and in situ hybridisation for the detection of PHV infection.
 
 The PCR assay and sequence analysis of the amplification products was used to compare the 373 bp region of the genome from strains obtained during the 1995 and 1998 epidemics. Significant differences between the strains were not detected.Additional sequence data was obtained adjacent to the 373 bp of known PHV sequence, which did not match any sequence in any of the genetic databases, and this will be invaluable for further study of the pilchard herpesvirus and the development of improved detection methods.
 
 The molecular-based methods of virus detection developed were applied to a re- examination of virus in paraffin-embedded tissues taken from fish during an attempt to transmit the virus to wild caught pilchards in 1999. The results obtained confirmed previously equivocal results that transmission of PHV to wild caught pilchards was achieved, although this experiment failed to demonstrate thattransmission of the virus resulted in severe lesions typical of those seen in the epizootics.
 
 Using formaldehyde-fixed samples from fish collected during the 1998 PHV epizootic, virus was detected in fish collected 4 days prior to the occurrence of the epizootic even though the fish then appeared clinically normal, during the epizootic, and 8 days after mortalities had ceased.
 
 An investigation of wild pilchards collected from 4 Australian pilchard sub-populations using real-time PCR demonstrated that PHV was present in the gills of 13.75% of 800 fish sampled, indicating that the virus is now endemic in the Australian pilchard population. Variation in the prevalence of PHV infection in the 4 subpopulations was detected, higher in western and southern populations than in populations from the east coast. The endemic nature of PHV infection in the pilchard population explains why there have been no further epizootics with mass mortalities since 1998.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/445/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mediated crisis: news and the national mind</field><field name="creator">Bottomley, John Arthur</field><field name="description">The thesis examines a mediated crisis and how The Straits Times and The Australian approach the reporting of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). It looks at how this mediated crisis exemplifies the culture of the national newspaper and in turn how the national newspaper has an historical influence on the national psyche. A total of 649 reports and headlines and 141 letters about SARS in The Straits Times (including The Straits Time Interactive) were examined from April 2003 to November 2003 as were 125 headlines from The Australian.
 
 The early sections of the thesis discuss how a crisis makes news; examine how the media report a crisis and what emphasis is given to aspects such as: actors, primary definers, vocabulary, lexical choices, subjects, themes, issues and value dimension or stance. The first chapter defines crisis, journalism and crisis journalism and discusses where the latter sits within the continuing expansion and development of major theoretical frameworks, including living in a risk society. The implication here is that crisis and risk have a symbiotic relationship.
 
 Historical perspectives of news are discussed in Chapter 2, and the newspaper is placed within the context of contemporary media. The chapter discusses how newspapers are aligned with the concept of the national mind and demonstrates the roles and formations of the two newspapers in relation to the SARS crisis.
 
 Chapter 3 codes the headlines, article titles and subtitles of The Straits Times and The Australian and using content analysis of the headlines, analyses the reporting of a serious health crisis SARS that lasted from March to November, 2003. The quantification within content analysis enables a researcher to read and interpret questions that relate to the intensity of meaning in texts, their social impact, the relationships between media texts and the realities and representations they reflect (Hansen et al, 1998). The theory and method of content analysis is used in this chapter to consider differences between The Straits Times and The Australian and to exemplify the media's representation of the narratives of SARS as it happened in the countries of Singapore and Australia.
 
 Aspects of crisis and risk, the newspaper and the national mind, narratives, presentations, and post SARS events are discussed in the last chapter. It is concluded from these discussions there is a world narrative that tells the story of how the human condition likes to live and rely on a safe social environment always being available. The relationship between a mediated crisis and risk are also discussed. In addition, it is maintained that reporting in 2003 was not just about SARS but a way of reporting that allowed one to view journalism as an aid to good governance, particularly with regard to living in a risk and crisis-ridden society.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/446/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the psychodynamic effects on individuals using psalms of lament intentionally, in the form of ritual prayer, as a way of engaging with experiences of personal distress</field><field name="creator">Cohen, David John</field><field name="description">The Psalter has formed the basis of Judeo-Christian worship since ancient times.  It has served, and continues to serve, individuals and communities of faith as a foundation for communal and personal devotion.  As a devotional tool it is unique in that it provides prayers which address God directly concerning the whole gamut of life experience.  While the Psalms can be examined and analysed as a literary text, they must be used and experienced by people to more fully discover and recognize their power in providing a pathway for expressing life experience.   
 
 The lament psalms are of particular interest in this regard.  There appears to be a reluctance, in some quarters, to employ them as an expression of prayer.  As a result, the lament psalms as a way of engaging with experiences of personal distress, and voicing the reflections and responses such experiences produce, have often been ignored. 
 
 This study suggests that psalms of lament provide a framework for expressing personal distress in the context of prayer.  The framework, identified as a matrix of lament, consists of various modes of articulation characterized as expressing, asserting, investing and imagining constellations.  The study examines what happens when individuals, who have first been made aware of the matrix of lament and its constellations, use lament psalms for prayer.  Praying of lament psalms in this study is embedded in a prescribed process through which participants engage with their experiences of personal distress.   
 
 As a result of such a process any significant psychodynamic changes which may take place can be observed, examined and explored, thereby, highlighting the efficacy of using lament psalms as a form of prayer.  The study achieves this by examining the reflections and responses of selected individuals to see whether the process does in fact facilitate changes in the individual's levels of distress, sense of personal control over distress and the nature of relationship between the individual and God.  The reflections and responses also provide some indication of how the process might 'birth' a fresh perspective on personal distress for those who choose to incorporate these psalms into their journey of faith.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/447/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shame, admiration, and self-esteem</field><field name="creator">Earl, Colin</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the shame that inheres in not being able to self-admire. I call this incapacity to admire oneself ontological shame, and I argue that it is the source of the masquerades, concealments and negative emotions that surround the pursuit and defence of a self-esteem founded on an impoverished form of pride. I argue that there is a radical asymmetry between our admiration and esteem for others and how we evaluate our own sense of self-worth. Where admiration at its highest pitch is the wonderful agape experience of apprehending preciousness in others, our own sense of self-worth is limited to experiences of pride and other forms of self-affirmation; none of which allow us the joy of seeing ourselves as wonders in the world. Because we can admire and want to be admired, not being able to self-admire amounts to a limitation of a sort which carries with it a primordial resentment against life itself. It is largely how we respond to our ontological limitation and to our resentment that determines the positive or negative manner in which we interact with others, and whether or not we are likely to have an envious or humble disposition.
 
 In the first three chapters I lay the groundwork for the main argument of the thesis by highlighting the difficulties self-esteem theorists have in agreeing upon the value of 'high' self-esteem, introduce the relation between self-esteem and shame, argue for a distinction between self-esteem and public esteem, and provide an account of the gift-exchange nature of admiration which explains why we cannot self-admire. In the central chapters I focus on shame; on acts of concealment that can be either appropriate covering for, or deceitful denial of our ontological limitation; how self-worth is created through a reconciliation to shame, and why the 'self-act dissociation' theories of guilt fail to capture the shame attached to 'being guilty' of a wrongdoing. In Chapters Seven and Eight I examine envy, first in how it can be disguised as moral resentment; how it differs to admiration in its role in emulation, and finally how as a disposition it stands in stark contrast to humility. It is in humility that we grasp the benefits associated with our own incapacity to self-admire through our need to interact and exchange gifts with others.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/448/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological aspects of Corylus avellana associated with the French black truffle fungus Tuber melanosporum and the consequence for commercial production of black truffles in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Bradshaw, Ben Philip</field><field name="description">The black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vitt.) industry in Australia is relatively new and has enormous potential but some truffieres (truffle farms) fail to meet anticipated harvest projections. Inappropriate soil conditions and climate, and the management of such factors are suggested as the primary reasons for inadequate yield. In addition, requirements for ascocarp initiation and development and the role of the host plant in such processes are unknown. This study examines interactions between European hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) black truffle symbiont in a commercial truffiere (Hazel Hill) in south-western Australia. Specific studies were initiated to examine the interactions of host physiology, mycorrhizal infection and the interaction with abiotic factors. The study related specific physiological processes of the host plant to the known life cycle of the black truffle to determine the role of the host plant in ascocarp production, if any. The work also examined the effect of silvicultural treatments intended to increase truffle production.
 
 A review of existing literature was undertaken to determine the key soil and climatic factors required for successful truffle production. Climatic conditions appeared more important than soil chemistry and structure in Western Australia, with significant seasonal variation in air and soil temperatures required plus irrigation to supplement summer rainfall. This information was used to define areas with potential for truffle production in the south-west of Western Australia: the cooler, high rainfall regions (&gt;1000 mm annual rainfall) where there is sufficient seasonal variation in soil temperature and availability of adequate quantities of quality water for irrigation. Subsurface soil acidification and salinity, as well as groundwater salinity, are constraining factors. Lime amendment is necessary to create sufficiently high pH and CaCO3 levels required by the truffle fungus. 
 
 A field trial was established to monitor the seasonal C dynamics of European hazel in the context of the life cycle of the black truffle. Maximum translocation of sucrose in the phloem sap coincided with the period of anticipated rapid growth of the truffle ascocarp implicating the use of current photosynthate in C nutrition of the ascocarp. Sampling of non-structural carbohydrates (NC) of above and belowground plant material indicated maximum storage of C in the host coincides with maturation of the ascocarp. These observations provide evidence of a synchronous growth habit of the plant host and the ascocarp. 
 
 The C allocation patterns of European hazel in response to liming a loamy soil, taken from near the Hazel Hill truffiere, and inoculation with ECM fungi (T. melanosporum, Hebeloma sp. and Scleroderma sp.) were examined in a glasshouse pot trial. Liming increased biomass allocation to the shoot and induced deficiencies of phosphorus and manganese. Colonisation by ECM fungi significantly increased net photosynthesis, indicating the sink strength of these fungi, but there was no relationship between the level of mycorrhizal infection and fine root NC. The maximum rate (40 g lime kg-1 soil) reduced infection by Hebeloma and Scleroderma and had no impact on T. melanosporum. Further, infection rates of T. melanosporum did not increase in response to lime suggesting lime is not necessary for ECM development in this soil type. 
 
 Fertiliser is widely used in commercial truffieres in Australia but the consequences for truffle production are unknown. In a field trial, the growth and physiological response of European hazel to forms of phosphorus (34 and 68 kg ha-1 apatite-P and 68 kg ha-1 triple super phosphate -P) and nitrogen (50 kg ha-1 of NO3- and NH4-N) were examined as well as the mycorrhizal response to fertiliser. Apatite-P increased phloem sap sucrose concentrations which was attributed to increased root biomass and associated sink capacity. Fertiliser application did not change fine root NC concentrations suggesting no increase in allocation of C to ECM structures. The highest rate of apatite-P decreased mycorrhizal infection rates of T. melanosporum and, most likely, was the result of increased infection rates of Hebeloma. In contrast to the literature relating to indigenous Australian ECM fungi, the highest rate of soluble-P did not decrease ECM infection rates in T. melanosporum. Nitrogen treatments increased foliar N content and improved gas exchange efficiency of plants, and had no adverse impact on the level of ECM infection. Fertilisation with N significantly increased soil respiration rates suggesting N limits mineralisation at this site. 
 
 Some truffieres manage the canopies of the host tree to ensure maximum exposure of the soil surface in order to increase soil temperatures. As there are no published data on the effect of pruning on black truffle production, a field trial was established to document the impact of canopy pruning on host physiology and soil temperature. The removal of 65% of canopy leaf area reduced phloem sap sucrose concentrations, soil respiration rate and the soluble: insoluble NC ratio of fine roots in the short term (1-3 weeks). There was no compensatory response of leaf gas exchange parameters as a result of pruning. Generally, there was no long term impact on plant physiological parameters as a result of pruning. Long term effects on soil temperature were observed as a result of pruning. Mean annual temperature and amplitude increased significantly beneath pruned trees and spring, summer and autumn soil temperatures increased as did diurnal variation as a result of pruning. Pruning did not increase winter soil temperatures and therefore would probably not impact on ascocarp maturation during this period. 
 
 This research has provided insight into the C physiology of hazel associated with the black truffle and the consequences for truffle production. The results provide anecdotal evidence of direct C transfer between the host and the developing truffle, contrary to the existing paradigm that the ascocarp is saprotrophic for the majority of its growth and development. There is a need to validate this finding as there are consequences for management of commercial truffieres. Liming of loam duplex soils can reduce the abundance of the most common competitor ECM fungi and should be encouraged in commercial truffieres. Applying phosphorus and nitrogen to commercial truffieres will improve growth rates of planted trees without adversely impacting on ECM infection by black truffle fungi, although the impact on truffle production remains unknown. It is anticipated truffle production will improve in the longer term as a result of pruning and prudent canopy management. Management options should include tree removal to reduce planting density and increase soil exposure in truffieres. There is a need for longer term trials to be established to determine the C nutrition of the truffle ascocarp and to clearly define the key stages of the black truffle life cycle in Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/449/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemistry of cathode materials in aqueous lithium hydroxide electrolyte</field><field name="creator">Minakshi Sundaram, Manickam</field><field name="description">Electrochemical behavior of electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD), chemically prepared battery grade manganese dioxide (BGM), titanium dioxide (TiO2), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) and lithium manganese phosphate (LiMnPO4) in aqueous lithium hydroxide electrolyte has been investigated. These materials are commonly used as cathodes in non-aqueous electrolyte lithium batteries. The main aim of the work was to determine how the electroreduction/oxidation behavior of these materials in aqueous LiOH compares with that reported in the literature in non-aqueous electrolytes in connection with lithium batteries. An objective was to establish whether these materials could also be used to develop other battery systems using aqueous LiOH as electrolyte.
 
 The electrochemical characteristics of the above materials were investigated by subjecting them to slow scan cyclic voltammetry and determining the charge/discharge characteristics of Zn/cathode material-aqueous LiOH batteries. The products of electroreduction/oxidation were characterized by physical techniques using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron micrography (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and infra-red spectrometry (IR).
 
 The reduction of gamma-MnO2 (EMD) in aqueous lithium hydroxide electrolyte is found to result in intercalation of Li+ into the host structure of gamma-MnO2. The process was found to be reversible for many cycles. This is similar to what is known to occur for gamma-MnO2 in non-aqueous electrolytes. The mechanism, however, differs from that for reduction/oxidation of gamma-MnO2 in aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte. KOH electrolyte is used in the state-of-art aqueous alkaline Zn/MnO2 batteries. Alkaline batteries based on aqueous KOH as the electrolyte rely upon a mechanism other than K+ intercalation into MnO2. This mechanism is not reversible. This is explained in terms of the relative ionic sizes of Li+ and K+. The lithium-intercalated MnO2 lattice is stable because Li+ and Mn4+ are of approximately the same size and hence Li+ is accommodated nicely into the host lattice of MnO2. The K+ ion which has almost double the size of Li+ cannot be appropriately accommodated into the host structure and hence the K+ -intercalated MnO2 phase is not stable.
 
 Chemically prepared battery grade MnO2 (BGM) is found to undergo electroreduction/oxidation in aqueous LiOH via the same Li+ intercalation mechanism as for the EMD. While the Zn/BGM- aqueous LiOH cell discharges at a voltage higher than that for the Zn/EMD- aqueous LiOH cell under similar conditions, the rechargeability and the material utilization of the BGM cell is poorer.
 
 The cathodic behavior of TiO2 (anatase phase) in the presence of aqueous LiOH is not reversible. In addition to LiTiO2, Ti2O3 is also formed. The discharge voltage of the Zn/TiO2- aqueous LiOH cell and material utilization of the TiO2 as cathode are very low. Hence TiO2 is not suitable for use in any aqueous LiOH electrolyte battery. 
 
 LiFePO4 (olivine-type structure) as a cathode undergoes electrooxidation in aqueous LiOH forming FePO4. However the subsequent reduction forms not only the original LiFePO4 but also Fe3O4. Thus the process is not completely reversible and hence LiFePO4 is not a suitable material for use as a cathode in aqueous battery systems.
 
 LiMnPO4 (olivine-type structure) undergoes reversible electrooxidation in aqueous LiOH forming MnPO4. The charge/discharge voltage profile of the Zn/MnPO4-aqueous LiOH cell, its coulombic efficiency and rechargeability are comparable to that of the cell using gamma-MnO2. EMD and LiMnPO4 both have the potential for use in rechargeable batteries using aqueous LiOH as the electrolyte. Recommendations for further developmental work for such batteries are made.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/450/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The occurrence and epidemiology of intestinal spirochaetes in humans in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Brooke, Celia Josephine</field><field name="description">The intestinal spirochaetes Brachyspira aalborgi and Brachyspira pilosicoli colonise the large intestine of humans, whilst B. pilosicoli also colonises a number of animal species. Both organisms have been detected in human intestinal spirochaetosis (HIS), a syndrome where the spirochaetes attach end-on to the colorectal epithelium, forming a characteristic false brush border. Colonisation by B. pilosicoli occurs at 30% in Australian Aborigines (Lee and Hampson, 1992), homosexual males (Trivett-Moore et al., 1998), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals and individuals from developing countries (Barrett, 1990; Trott et al., 1997a). Studies on B. aalborgi have focussed mainly on its detection from Caucasians.
 
 Clinically, colonisation with Brachyspira spp. has been linked to gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. More seriously, invasive colitis and hepatitis associated with intestinal spirochaetes have been recorded, and B. pilosicoli has been isolated from the blood of nine patients. However, the pathogenic significance of Brachyspira spp. remains uncertain, due to an inconsistent clinical picture, carriage by healthy individuals and the absence of accurate spirochaete identification in many studies.
 
 Identification of the organisms by culture and microscopy has been difficult, due to morphological similarities and biochemical heterogeneity of the Brachyspira spp.. In addition, B. pilosicoli is the easier spirochaete to culture, and so has predominated in studies assessing faecal carriage. The recent development of molecular methods has allowed unequivocal speciation of the Brachyspira spp. Thus the main aim of this thesis was to examine the prevalence and epidemiology of B. pilosicoli and B. aalborgi in Australia, using this new methodology.
 
 Intestinal carriage of both species was examined in faecal specimens using culture, microscopy and two species-specific 16S rRNA PCRs. Carriage of Brachyspira spp. was determined in individuals from rural areas of Western Australia (WA) with gastrointestinal symptoms, (including 151 Aboriginal and 142 non-Aboriginal Australians), 227 migrants to Australia, and 90 healthy control individuals from Perth, Western Australia. When samples were assessed by culture, B. pilosicoli was isolated from the faeces of 10.6% of migrant and 9.9% of Aboriginal Australian individuals. B. pilosicoli carriage was significantly higher in Aboriginal children aged 2 - 4 years (P = 0.0027) and migrants of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin (P = 0.0034). Carriage in each population was associated with the detection of a number of intestinal parasites. It was not clear whether an association existed between B. pilosicoli isolation and disease, as similar proportions were found in sick Aboriginal patients and presumably healthy migrant individuals. B. pilosicoli may have caused disease in Aboriginal children where other pathogens were not present, or may have contributed to disease with known or suspected pathogens. In particular, colonisation was significantly more frequent in individuals with chronic diarrhoea or failure to thrive (FTT) (P = 0.016), and was also increased in elderly patients. The association of B. pilosicoli with parasites may have been due to behavioural factors, or an as yet unknown relationship between the organisms. B. aalborgi was not isolated from the specimens of rural individuals or migrants, as culture media and conditions for this organism were not optimal, but was thought to have been the spirochaetes seen by microscopy in culture negative samples. As a result, a more appropriate isolation medium for B. aalborgi was developed, containing brain heart infusion agar with 10% bovine blood, spectinomycin and polymyxin B. One isolate of B. aalborgi was obtained on this medium, from a control individual with self-reported chronic diarrhoea. The colonial, phase contrast and electron microscopic morphologies of two cell types present in the sample were described, and partial 16S rRNA sequences obtained. However, even with the modified media, other samples in this population contained spirochaetes that could not be cultured. 
 
 PCR conducted on DNA extracted by the Qiagen QIAmp column method was more suitable for determining the prevalence of Brachyspira spp. in these specimens. B. pilosicoli was detected in higher proportions by PCR, in 15.0% of migrants and 14.5% of Aboriginals, but again not in symptomatic or healthy non-Aboriginal Australians. Detection of B. pilosicoli by PCR changed the identification of risk factors only a little; detection of protozoa in migrants, and protozoa, G. intestinalis, H. nana in Aboriginals were no longer associated with B. pilosicoli detection. B. aalborgi DNA was detected in 7.9% of migrants, 6.9% of Aboriginals, 5.6% of non-Aboriginal patients, and 5.6% of controls. Approximately equal proportions were obtained from migrant individuals from African, Middle Eastern and Eastern European countries. Both spirochaete species were detected in migrants (5.6%) and Aboriginal Australians (4.1%), and carriage of one spirochaete was significantly associated with carriage of the other spirochaete in both populations (P &lt;0.001). These data suggest that the two Brachyspira spp. have a different epidemiology, and that B. aalborgi may be distributed at a similar prevalence in many human populations.
 
 Carriage of B. aalborgi was associated with larger family size in migrants (P &lt;0.001), and if a family member was positive, it was significantly more likely that other family members would be colonised (P = 0.008). Two colonised control individuals also came from the same family, all suggesting that transmission of B. aalborgi can occur between family members. Carriage of B. aalborgi was significantly higher in Aboriginal patients aged 2 - 18 y, and in non-Aboriginal patients aged &gt;18 y and between 60 - 69 y. Detection was associated with various parasites in Aboriginals, but only protozoans in migrants (P = 0.014). Detection of B. aalborgi was associated with diarrhoea in non- Aboriginals (P = 0.048), with an absence of diarrhoea (P = 0.016) amongst Aboriginals, and with eosinophilia, weight loss, being underweight and suspected worms in this group also (P &lt;0.001). Whether B. aalborgi was a cause of these symptoms, or was excreted as a result of the symptoms caused by some other source, was unknown. The pathogenic significance ofB. aalborgi also could not be resolved in this investigation, as similar proportions were detected in ill and healthy individuals, and detection was associated with different reasons for investigation in the two ill population groups. B. aalborgi could be a commensal in the human gastrointestinal tract, or may have the capacity to cause disease under certain circumstances, such as in individuals with poor immune status, or in a conducive gut microenvironment.
 
 PCR products were sequenced to attempt to differentiate between B. aalborgi strains. All except five strains were identical to the type strain, three had nucleotide changes that placed them in cluster 3 described by Pettersson et al. (2000), another strain shared similarity with cluster 2 or 3 strains and the final strain remained in cluster 1. More complete sequencing of this gene, or the use of another sequence based typing method, such as multi-locus sequence typing, would be useful to further investigate the molecular epidemiology of B. aalborgi carriage in human populations. A comparison between techniques for intestinal spirochaete detection was made. 
 
 PCR was the most successful method for detecting spirochaetes in faeces, with a lower limit of detection of B. pilosicoli in seeded faeces at 1 x 10^6 organism/g and 1 x 105 organism/g for B. aalborgi. Microscopy was inadequate for identifying the spirochaetes, and lacked sensitivity, with only 1 x 10^7 - 1 x 10^5 organisms/g of seeded faeces visible in this way. Culture was adequate for B. pilosicoli, with isolation possible from seeded faeces containing 1 x 10^2 - 2 x 10^3 cfu/g. Culture was inadequate for B. aalborgi detection, despite isolation from seeded faeces at 2 x 10^4 cfu/g, and advances made to isolation media for this spirochaete in the course of this investigation.
 
 There were concerns that B. pilosicoli spirochaetaemia might be occurring in Western Australian populations with a high rate of intestinal carriage, but going undiagnosed. An evaluation of the blood culture systems commonly used in Australia indicated that the automated BACTEC system using the BACTEC plus Anaerobic/F bottle was best for the detection of B. pilosicoli in seeded blood. A protocol longer than the 5 d normally utilised by clinical laboratories was required to detect the organism when seeded at low concentrations. Both manual Hemoline and Septi-Chek media were as reliable as the BACTEC for B. pilosicoli growth, however detection in these systems required frequent subculture, and was thus time-consuming and laborious. The automated BacT/Alert system performed poorly both for detection and recovery of B. pilosicoli, and medium and algorithmic components were probable contributing factors. BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F bottles inoculated with blood from 801 patients thought to be at risk for blood infection with B. pilosicoli were cultured for 14 d, or 21 d after transport from rural centres. No isolate was obtained from these individuals, but there were some problems inherent in the investigation. However, while bacteraemia with B. pilosicoli is clearly a rare medical event, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis in immunocompromised individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms, and possibly in groups with high rates of intestinal carriage of B. pilosicoli.
 
 Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, utilising MluI and SmaI restriction enzymes, was used to examine the relationships between B. pilosicoli isolates collected from Aboriginal and migrant individuals, and some pre-existing strains. In migrants, isolates were distributed throughout the dendrogram created after analysis with MluI; however, the migrants had originated from 10 countries around the world. Two B. pilosicoli isolates from two individuals from the same family were closely related, indicating that exposure from a common source or transmission from one individual to another might have occurred. As no other isolate from migrants were related, even among members of other families, transmission between family members did not appear to be common.
 
 Strains from Australian Aboriginals were also distributed throughout the MluI dendrogram, but the majority (89.7%) were clustered in one of six clonal groups. Isolates were obtained from different locations and years of sampling, supporting previous observations that B. pilosicoli colonising Aboriginal people have an epidemic population structure (Trott et al., 1998). An explanation for the presence of clonal groups was not clear. Increased virulence of isolates may have contributed to the spread of B. pilosicoli clones in WA Aboriginals. All isolates from hospitalised individuals, and those obtained from samples where no other pathogen was detected were members of clonal groups, however, no isolate from healthy Aboriginals was included in the investigation. Resistance to one or more antimicrobial also may have favoured selection for and spread of clonal isolates in the Aboriginal population.
 
 The antimicrobial susceptibility of 139 B. pilosicoli isolates was obtained by a procedure modified from the NCCLS agar dilution method (NCCLS, 1990). Strains were generally sensitive to agents tested, but variably resistant to clindamycin and amoxicillin, depending on the source of strains. Over 50% of strains contained a beta-lactamase that was inhibited by clavulanic acid. Significantly higher proportions of isolates from Aboriginal Australians (P &lt;0.001) contained a beta-lactamase than other isolates, while no isolate from PNG natives did (P &lt;0.001), nor was any isolate from this population resistant to any other antimicrobial. Isolates from pigs and homosexuals demonstrated raised MICs for tetracycline and resistance to amoxicillin and clindamycin. All Aboriginal isolates in clonal groups contained a beta-lactamase, as did other isolates not classified within clonal groups. Further analysis of the virulence characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates is required.
 
 Based on susceptibility results and success in previous studies, metronidazole was a potential choice for treatment of HIS, and to remove intestinal carriage of B. pilosicoli. For therapy in spirochaetaemia, intravenous ceftriaxone or Timentin would be preferred over penicillin antibiotics in view of the frequent occurrence of resistance. Carriage of spirochaetes is currently going unrecognised in Australian laboratories, as current protocols do not specifically target their detection, and current medical opinion remains ambivalent about their significance. Detection by any of culture, microscopy, PCR is not difficult, and could be implemented to examine faecal specimens during investigations of individuals with chronic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology, or in children who are failing to thrive.
 
 In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis examined a range of issues relating to the epidemiology of intestinal spirochaetes in humans. The prevalence of B. aalborgi and B. pilosicoli was determined in faeces by microscopy, culture and PCR. The spirochaetes were present in both healthy and ill individuals, at around 15% for B. pilosicoli and 6% for B. aalborgi. Each organism was associated with specific risk factors in the populations assessed. The prevalence of bacteraemia with B. pilosicoli was examined, but no episode was identified in the study. The molecular epidemiology of B. pilosicoli was analysed using PFGE. MIC data were determined for B. pilosicoli and based on these, therapies for infections with this organism were suggested. Similar studies on B. aalborgi are now required to provide a more complete understanding of the epidemiology of this organism in humans.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/451/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical case study of strategic alliances in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Abdul Ghani, Ahmad Bashawir</field><field name="description">This study is premised on the assumption that cooperative partnerships or strategic alliances will become the dominant structure for business in future decades (Drucker, 1989). This is evident in the phenomenal growth in the establishment of alliances the world over despite high failure rates. The high failure rate not withstanding, both domestic and international alliances are critically important to firm success (Glaister and Buckley, 1999). Currently, the top 500 global business firms average 60 major strategic alliances each (Dyer et al., 2001). Results also indicate that more than 80% of surveyed top level managers view strategic alliances as a primary growth vehicle and expect alliances to account for 25% of their company's market value by 2005 (Schifrin, 2001).
 
 The simultaneous developments that go under the name of globalization make alliances or entente necessary. Entente, the striking of an alliance, is a responsible part of every good strategist's repertoire (Ohmae, 2001). In a world of imperfect options, they are often the fastest, least risky and most profitable way to go global; and properly managed alliances are among the best mechanisms that companies have found to bring strategy to bear on these challenges. Although the use of alliances reduces entry risks, managing these alliances entails difficulties. Moreover, this entry strategy has some peculiarities of its own, especially when there are significant cultural differences between the partners. Under these circumstances, partner selection and initial steps toward managing the new relationship become critical factors for successful entry. At the partnership creation stage, the balance between the contributions each company will bring to the partnership and the difficulties they will face in managing their relationship need to be considered. As the relationship unfolds, social processes gain importance. The level of inter partner trust or 'perceived likelihood of the other not behaving in a self interested manner' (Madhok, 1995, p.120) influences the performance of the partnership (Gill and Butler, 1996).
 
 Whilst research in the West has attempted to focus on such failings, few researchers have attempted to understand the state of alliances in developing country contexts and alliance partner selection. Malaysia is a successful developing economy with a distinct institutional environment. This thesis explores (1) the criteria used by Malaysian firms to select their partner, both task related and partner related criteria; (2) the contributions that Malaysian firms and their foreign counterparts bring to the partnership; and (3) management of the inter partner relationship, including the difficulties encountered, how the relationship management varies with the characteristics of the Malaysian partner, and the resulting effects on the process of trust building. The study's results suggest that Malaysia's stable and supportive institutional environment has helped Malaysian firms take a longer term view of alliance partner selection, focusing more on the potential partner's intangible assets along with technological and managerial capabilities rather than merely transaction cost concerns. The study also finds that Malaysian firms, when entering into strategic alliances, do not consider every option, that is, they use filters to reduce the potential choice. Thus the range of possible alliance partners is restricted in many ways, some of these being unconsciously employed. Furthermore, it is clear that, while Malaysian firms consider margins, ratios and percentages, relationships have a pre-eminent role in strategic alliances and that relationships are poised between ends and means to ends. It can therefore be surmised that the overall selection process in Malaysia is fundamentally shaped by the manner in which potential alliance partners are initially identified. Case study evidence from a sample of Malaysian firms seems to bear this out. This study therefore contributes to knowledge about the influence of the institutional environment on alliance partner selection decisions for firms domiciled in developing countries. 
 
 The study utilized phenomenology as its research paradigm, along with the case study method. These methods were found to be highly relevant for conducting exploratory research into strategic alliances because of the need to generate holistic data and for such data to be interpreted within context. Finally, Malaysia's economic performance to date has been impressive and the outlook for continued high growth rates is good. As Malaysia embarks on the next stage of development, the complementarities between the Malaysian firms and foreign economies will provide even greater opportunities for greater economic integration. The managerial implications for business managers are highlighted. Thus, the formation of strategic alliances to achieve or maintain a competitive advantage and enhance the firm's performance is an important issue warranting further study (Arino, 2001).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/452/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermodynamic and related studies of aqueous copper(II) sulfate solutions</field><field name="creator">Akilan, Chandrika</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a systematic investigation of the thermodynamic quantities associated with the interaction between Cu2+ and SO42- in aqueous solution.  A variety of techniques including UV-Visible spectrophotometry, Cu(II) ion-selective electrode potentiometry, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and titration calorimetry have been used. 
 
 The values for the  (aq) association constants determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry in NaClO4 media as a function of ionic strength were in good agreement with published data but were lower than the values obtained from Cu(II) ion -selective electrode potentiometry.  The source of this difference was traced to the presence of solvent-separated ion pairs which are only partially detected by UV-Vis spectrophotometry.  This was shown by a detailed investigation of CuSO4(aq) over a wide range of concentrations using modern broad-band dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS).  This technique revealed the presence of three ion-pair types: double solvent-separated, solvent-shared and contact ion pairs. 
 
 Calorimetric titrations using the log KA values determined by potentiometry, have provided for the first time reliable values for the enthalpy and entropy changes associated with complex formation between Cu2+(aq) and SO42-(aq) system over range of ionic strengths (in NaClO4 media).  These data were fitted to a specific ion interaction model to obtain the standard state value which was in excellent agreement with the values obtained in other studies and from the DRS work in this study. 
 
 In addition, investigations have been carried out into the physicochemical properties, (osmotic coefficients, densities, heat capacities, solubilities and viscosities) of ternary mixtures of CuSO4(aq) with Na2SO4(aq) or MgSO4(aq).  The isopiestic measurements (water activities) of the mixtures were in general well described by Zdanovskii's rule, especially for the mixtures of CuSO4 with MgSO4.  The densities of the ternary mixtures of CuSO4 with MgSO4 were found to follow Young's rule of mixing but those of CuSO4 with Na2SO4 deviated from linearity.  The solubilities of the salts in their ternary mixtures agree well with literature data and show that the solubility of MgSO4 or CuSO4 decreases with increasing Na2SO4 concentration.  The viscosities of all the ternary mixtures show clear negative departures from 'Young's rule' type behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/453/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's stupid being a girl!: the tomboy character in selected children's series fiction</field><field name="creator">Chew, Cynthia Mei-Li</field><field name="description">The tomboy is a female character that has featured prominently in many popular works of children's literature. Typically, the tomboy is a prepubescent or teenaged girl who is frustrated by the expectations and limitations placed upon her because she is female. She is reluctant to conform to feminine standards of appearance and behaviour. 
 
 This thesis examines the representation and evolution of the tomboy character in two distinct categories of children's series fiction, 'books in a series' and 'series books'[1], focusing on narratological elements such as plot, characterisation and series structure, as well as their publishing context, exploring issues of authorial intent, editorial decisions and, in certain cases, the official revision of texts. 'Books in a series' are usually presented as bildungsroman - that is, stories, or in this case, series, of development. In these narratives, time progresses and the characters age; tomboyishness is depicted as a temporary phase which is grown out of when a girl matures, and learns to accept and perform femininity. In contrast, 'series books' are centred on adventure and/or mystery stories, rather than on the process of growing up - the characters' ages are typically frozen, and tomboyishness is a distinguishing character attribute which remains for the course of the series. 
 
 In studying children's literature, it is important to acknowledge that the audience of children's literature includes adults as well as children - it is after all, adults who determine and control the production, distribution and legitimisation of texts for children. Originally, children's literature was written specifically for the religious, moral, behavioural and social instruction of children, rather than for their entertainment. Although appearing less overtly didactic in recent times, the production of children's literature has continued to be driven by the adult concern for ideological appropriateness, and the desire to responsibly educate its young readers. This concern and desire are fuelled by the underlying and persistent belief that children are like sponges and will absorb whatever they are exposed to[2], including representations of gender difference and gender performance. The ways in which the tomboy character has evolved in the children's series are a direct reflection of the shifts in society's ideas about gender, the gendered education of children, and the adult conception of what is ideologically appropriate for the children's text. 
 
 The tomboy character in children's literature has been an important cultural marker of both our evolving and constant values. It is clear that over time gender roles have changed significantly, allowing girls in series fiction to be sleuths, rescuers, warriors and adventurers, but through all of this change, the representation of the tomboy has always reflected adults' conception of what is ideologically appropriate and normal and therefore desirable, in the representation of masculinity and femininity, gender and sexuality in children's literature - a normality and system of gender based on a steadfast heterosexual hegemony.

It focuses on epistemological aspects and assumptions made within the parameters of Enlightenment thinking or the Newtonian paradigm, also known as the classical scientit1c paradigm. It argues that lmowledge formed within this paradigm, usually generated at a distance, has been individ,uated, detached, segmented and abstracted. 'Individuation' focuses on individuals and things rather than communities and processes. 'Detachment' separates the subjective mind from the objective environment to produce reliable information. 'Segmentation' produces validity of information by parsing the objective environment from its social and historical context. 'Abstraction' allows objectivity and systematisation of information. When used to inform policy, such knowledge creates a narrow 'standardising gaze' that 'disciplines' communities to conform to dominant social behaviour and beliefs. Case studies are used to demonstrate that the two major models of development, as products ofthis paradigm, employ this gaze rendering replicability difficult ifnot impossible. These models are the top-down and bottom-up approach that are epitomised by the Silicon Valley model and telecentre moveluent respectively. How this gaze inhibits/facilitates development in policy implementation is then examined in the Goldfields Esperance region in Western Australia. An holistic approach using cotnplex adaptive systems is used to understand the multidisciplinary aspects involved in development. This is combined with action research, a reflexive methodology. Action research has the ability to access local knowledge to provide data and evaluation in situ rather than on a post hoc basis. The findings demonstrate that complex systems analysis and action research provide a modus operandi that: a) recognises the interplay of various factors (such as power relations, economic cycle, social and political institutions) at different levels of the system; b) recognises time, context and path-dependence of regional development; c) provides a filter that minimises the 'standardising gaze' and d) gives an access to knowledge and insight to local issues, which can facilitate policy implementation of development that is sympathetic to regional communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/455/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathosystem development, characterisation and genetic dissection of the soil pathogen Phytophthora medicaginis and the model legume Medicago truncatula: a view to application of disease resistance in susceptible legume species</field><field name="creator">D'Souza, Nola Kim</field><field name="description">Phytophthora medicaginis is an important soil-borne oomycete pathogen of lucerne (Medicago sativa) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) within Australia and overseas. To understand the host/pathogen interaction, a pathosystem was developed using the model legume Medicago truncatula. Using the resources developed for genetics and molecular characterisation in this model plant, the aim of this research was to understand the interaction between M. truncatula and P. medicaginis, with a view to improving resistance to this important pathogen in related legumes. 
 
 To observe and characterise the interaction between M. truncatula and P. medicaginis, a pathosystem was developed by first screening a germplasm collection of 99 M. truncatula accessions. This revealed a continuous distribution in disease phenotypes with variable extremes in natural resistance to P. medicaginis culture UQ5750, isolated originally from M. sativa. P. medicaginis zoospore inoculation of 1-2 week-old seedlings in glasshouse experiments proved to be a robust and repeatable method to consistently confirm the responses observed for six key M. truncatula accessions; SA8618 and SA8623 exhibit high natural resistance to this pathogen, accession A17 is moderately resistant, A20 is moderately susceptible and accessions Borung and SA30199 are susceptible. 
 
 To characterise the genetic basis of resistance to P. medicaginis, two reciprocal F2 populations from cross pollinations between A17 and Borung and SA8618 and SA30199 were produced and then phenotyped for disease symptoms. Genetic segregation patterns indicated the involvement of a gene with a major effect in both reciprocal populations. In particular, a 3:1 segregation ratio for resistance in the F2 populations from cross pollinations between A17 and Borung indicated the possibility of a single dominant gene for moderate resistance. Further phenotyping of F3 families is required to verify this. 
 
 A M. truncatula linkage map was constructed using 50 F2 individuals of the A17 X Borung population and 49 F2 individuals from the Borung X A17 population. The map, covering 519.3 cM, is comprised of 84 SSR markers with an average distance between markers of 8.7 cM. These are evenly spaced over 7 linkage groups, including a super linkage group conferred by a translocation event between LG4 and LG8 of accession A17. 
 
 Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis confirmed there was a QTL with a major effect in the A17/Borung reciprocal populations. A significant QTL was determined by quantifying two symptoms of P. medicaginis infection - proportion of dead/chlorotic leaves and root fresh weight. The trait loci for both symptoms were located on the same linkage group within the same region, supporting the putative position of the QTL and the authenticity of its involvement in resistance to P. medicaginis. This QTL was located on LG6 and accounted for 69.5% of the observed variation in proportion of dead/chlorotic leaves or 38.1% of the variation in root fresh weight within the inoculated populations. The effect of this QTL on resistance to P. medicaginis translated into 27.5% less dead/chlorotic leaves or 0.86 g more root fresh weight. Other QTLs with minor effects that are potentially involved in the interaction are located elsewhere on LG6 and LG2. However, the marker density of the linkage map and the population size need to be increased to verify this. 
 
 In parallel to this, an F7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of chickpea (BG212 X Jimbour), developed by breeders at the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI), was also assessed for the genetic basis of resistance to P. medicaginis. Variance component analysis of phenotype scores for this intraspecific RIL population indicated that 57.15% of the differences in between-family and withinfamily variance could be attributed to a genetic component. However, gene-based markers developed in M. truncatula and established simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers of chickpea were not sufficiently polymorphic in size to produce a linkage map for further QTL analysis. 
 
 An interspecific cross between C. arietinum and C. echinospermum (Howzat X ILWC246) was also performed by breeders at the NSW DPI to develop RILs. In the duration of this research these interspecific RILs were bred to generation F3 and phenotyping assessment had not been performed. However, marker screening of the parents revealed 122 size polymorphic chickpea SSR markers. A sufficient linkage map could be produced for QTL analysis once field assessment of this population is performed. Initial screening of the M. truncatula gene-based markers on the parents of this interspecific cross also revealed that 50% show a sequence-identified base pair difference. A chickpea linkage map incorporating these markers could be comparatively mapped with M. truncatula. 
 
 Molecular investigations of the M. truncatula/P. medicaginis pathosystem were performed to elucidate the possible underlying defence mechanisms involved in the observed resistance. To determine the function of ethylene in the resistant response, the characterisation of defence associated mutants of M. truncatula and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated 'hairy root' transformations were employed. Comparison of response to inoculation of an ethylene insensitive mutant of M. truncatula (sickle) with the moderately resistant background genotype A17 showed that sickle was hypersensitive to P. medicaginis. This indicated that ethylene insensitivity was not the source of resistance to this pathogen and importantly that ethylene is a key defence signalling molecule in the moderate resistance of A17 to P. medicaginis. 
 
 Agrobacterium-mediated 'hairy root' transformations of M. truncatula with 4GCC::Luc constructs, revealed that the production of ethylene and consequently ethylene response factors (ERFs) after inoculation by P. medicaginis was a general defence reaction by all accessions. The two susceptible M. truncatula accessions exhibited a much stronger and earlier response to inoculation than the highly resistant and moderately resistant accessions. This indicated that the resistant response may be directed by a transcriptional component governed by the host genotype, downstream of ethylene production. The M. truncatula/P. medicaginis 'hairy root' transformation assay has scope to be a powerful functional genomics tool for this pathogen interaction. 
 
 Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) was employed to determine the general patterns of gene expression and function underlying the response to P. medicaginis infection. Relative changes in gene expression of key enzymes in each of the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene and isoflavonoid defence pathways and in genes encoding downstream target proteins revealed potential genes involved in the resistance to P. medicaginis. There was a distinct molecular difference in the response between the high and moderately resistant M. truncatula phenotypes to this pathogen. Moderate resistance to P. medicaginis in M. truncatula is possibly mediated by ethylene and involves the considerable  induction of pathogenesis related protein 5 (PR5), which was not the same defence response that conferred the high resistance to P. medicaginis. Early and consistent expression of genes encoding key enzymes of the isoflavonoid pathway by the highly resistant accession indicated that phytoalexin response could be associated with the high resistance. Confirmation of the involvement of isoflavonoid phytoalexins in the high resistance response to P. medicaginis merits further investigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/456/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water deficit in bread wheat: characterisation using genetic and physiological tools</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jingjuan</field><field name="description">Under terminal water deficit, the impact of stem carbohydrate remobilization has greater significance because post-anthesis assimilation is limited, and grain growth depends on translocation of carbohydrate reserves. The working hypothesis of this thesis is that increases in stem carbohydrates facilitate tolerance to terminal drought in wheat. The goals of this thesis are to examine this hypothesis using physiological and genetic tools; identify genes that are related to QTL for stem carbohydrate; work with wheat and barley breeders to integrate findings into the breeding program of the Department of Agricultural and Food Western Australia.
 
 The physiological data of three drought experiments (two years in a glasshouse and one year in the field) suggested the maximum level of stem water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) is not consistently related to grain weight, especially, under water deficit. The patterns of WSC accumulation after anthesis differed depending on variety and suggested that WSC degradation and translocation have different genetic determinants.
 
 Most of the carbohydrates in stem WSC in wheat are fructans. Because 1-FEH gene was an important gene in fructan degradation, the three copies of this gene (1-FEH w1, 1-FEH w2 and 1-FEH w3) were isolated from the respective genomes of bread wheat. In addition, the genes were mapped to chromosome locations and coincided with QTL for grain weight. The results of gene expression studies show that 1-FEH w3 had significantly higher levels in the stem and sheath which negatively corresponded to the level of stem WSC in two wheat varieties in both water-deficit and well-watered treatments. Strikingly, the 1-FEH w3 appeared to be activated by water deficit in Westonia but not in Kauz. The results suggest that stem WSC level is not, on its own, a reliable criterion to identify potential grain yield in wheat exposed to water deficit during grain filling. The expression of 1-FEH w3 may provide a better indicator when linked to instantaneous water use efficiency, osmotic potential and green leaf retention, and this requires validation in field grown plants. In view of the location of the contribution to grain filling of stem WSC, this is a potential candidate gene contributing to grain filling. The numerous differences of intron sequences of 1-FEH genes would provide more opportunities to find markers associated with the QTL.
 
 A new FEH gene was partially isolated from Chinese Spring and the sequence was closely related to 1-FEH genes. This gene, FEH w4, was mapped to 6AS using Chinese Spring deletion bin lines. The polymorphism of this gene was found between different bread varieties using PCRs and RFLPs, and this allowed the gene to be mapped to two populations of Hanxuan 10 x Lumai 14 and Cranbrook x Halberd. In the population of Hanxuan 10 x Lumai 14, it was close to SSR marker xgwm334 and wmc297 where the QTL of thousand grain weight and grain filling efficiency were located. This result indicated this gene might be another possible candidate gene for grain weight and grain filling in wheat.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/457/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SO2/O2 as an oxidant in hydrometallurgy</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Wensheng</field><field name="description">Abstract is not available</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/458/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fisheries biology and management of pink snapper, Pagrus auratus, in the inner gulfs of Shark Bay, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Gary</field><field name="description">This study explored an important aspect of the basis for the highly complex population structure of pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) within the inner gulfs of Shark Bay, investigated how growth and reproduction differ among these closely-adjacent but separate stocks, and obtained biomass estimates for each stock that are essential for the sustainable management of the regionally-important recreational pink snapper fishery. Using ichthyoplankton data in combination with hydrodynamic modelling, P. auratus eggs and larvae were shown to be retained within localized meso-scale eddies that were coincident with the main inner gulf spawning areas. Such hydrodynamic retention, in conjunction with tagging and otolith chemistry data that indicates very limited movement of juvenile and adult fish, explains how separate pink snapper populations can exist in the adjacent waters of the Eastern Gulf, Denham Sound and Freycinet Estuary. The study found significant variation in maximum age, growth, maturity and spawning time at fine spatial scales. Such variation, unusual for a large, potentially mobile fish inhabiting a marine environment with no obvious physical barriers, is linked to the inner gulfs' marked environmental heterogeneity, the low levels of mixing and historic differences in fishing pressure among the three areas. The daily egg production method (DEPM) was used, for the first time with this species in Western Australia, to provide estimates of spawning biomass of the three separate inner gulf P. auratus stocks. While relatively imprecise, mostly due to imprecision in estimation of daily egg production, these estimates demonstrated that these stocks are very small (measured in tens of tonnes) compared with P. auratus stocks elsewhere in Australia and New Zealand. Biological data and DEPM estimates obtained from this study were incorporated in age-based stock assessment models that have been used to determine the status of inner gulf pink snapper stocks since 2002.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/664/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living on the edge: transport sustainability in Perth's Liveable Neighbourhoods</field><field name="creator">Falconer, Ryan</field><field name="description">Following World War Two, land use and transport policy and practice in most major Australian cities was modelled on the US experience. As such, these cities have become characterised by urban sprawl (indicated by segregated zoning and low development densities) and car dependence. In Perth, Western Australia, these characteristics are particularly evident despite, or perhaps because, the city has a strong regional planning system unlike most American cities. 
 
 Car dependence and sprawl are in turn linked to dependence on fossil fuels for transport energy. Increasingly, too, links are being found between conventional planning outcomes and public health. For example, research has linked car dependence with a variety of health conditions including respiratory illness, overweight and obesity. Moreover, research is increasingly linking sprawl and car dependence with social justice issues because people on limited income and with decreased mobility struggle to undertake their life's work. 
 
 In response to these concerns the Western Australian planning system introduced Liveable Neighbourhoods, a new design code, which was meant to reduce car dependence and sprawl. This code has its roots in New Urbanism and appears to have been taken up more rapidly in Perth than elsewhere. No large-scale evaluation of New Urbanism has previously been conducted anywhere. This thesis reports on an extensive literature review, travel survey (n=211), perceptual study (n=992) and environmental study, which together sought to evaluate whether the Liveable Neighbourhoods (LN) design code is contributing to a sustainable transport agenda. In total, 46 neighbourhoods (11 LNs and 35 CNs) were compared. The research found that despite residents of Liveable Neighbourhoods driving less and walking more than residents of conventional neighbourhoods (CNs) (a switch of 9% with some associated health advantages), there was little else to indicate that LN is achieving its goals as transport VKT and fuel use was identical due to regional transport requirements diminishing any local walkability advantages. 
 
 There was strong supportive evidence that LNs were not significantly different to CNs. For example, there were few differences in perception of opportunity for more sustainable travel and residents of CNs actually had better access, on average, to key destinations, including shops (i.e. the average distance to key destinations was 2.2 kilometres compared with 2.5 kilometres in LNs). Also, residential lot densities were well below what were intended by LN and in both LNs and CNs the time for public transport to get people to work was over 90 minutes compared with around 30 minutes by car. 
 
 The results reveal that there must be significant revisions to the LN code and how it is applied, because there is no evidence that new neighbourhoods are improving regional transport sustainability. In particular, residential densities and land use mix appear to be too low to encourage community self-sufficiency, indicated by few neighbourhoods being anchored by key destinations.

Like women's domestic labor which is invisible in economic statistics, soap opera audiences have been similarly invisible or marginalized and stigmatized in dominant discourse by virtue of the fact that they watch soap operas. These fans, however, exist as part of a secondary oral culture which exists among women. Soaps texts are highly influenced by the oral characteristics of this culture. In addition to clarifying the oral characteristics of soaps, I have theorized that when feminine subjects, in this case soap opera fans, understand their subordinate position with in a society and speak to each other with this type of knowledge, they are speaking what I have called feminine discourse.
 
 The discursive position involved establishes boundaries for women's oral culture and legitimizes the experience of women as soap fans. In the marginalized discourse of soap opera fanship, part of the pleasure which fans experience in watching and talking about soaps is the affirmation of their subjectivity, even though their position in society is subordinate. Another aspect of pleasure in soap opera fanship is the mutual strengthening which comes from the power of talk outside of the control of dominant discourses. In addition, gossip among women has the potential for keeping women from being politically isolated, giving them space and time to talk with each other without the constraints imposed by dominant culture. While soaps knowledge marks the boundaries of this aspect of women's culture, laughter and irony seem to place these women in some ways outside of dominant discourse. Although feminine soap opera audiences are structured by the producers as consumers in and for the home and the patriarchal family, in these interviews they negotiate spaces for their own critical interpretations of patriarchical conventions.
 
 The private discourse of soap opera audienceness in which these viewers of soap operas engage is further negotiated in this work with the public discourses about soap opera audiences which struggle to contain the meanings of femaleness within patriarchical culture. What I call the ideology of dependence works discursively on multiple levels to assure that women and girls conform to dominant notions of feminity in order to live comfortably in a world that is full of contradictions for women. Multiple cultural discourses reinforce the expected codes of behavior, but particular sites provide spaces where discursive containment leaks through narrative seams. This happens in soap opera texts and soap opera fanship networks partially because of the impossibility of fully containing orality.

The community studies focused on comparing the species compositions of the fish faunas found over bare sand and in mangroves and rock pools and on elucidating the factors that influence those compositions. The population studies concentrated on exploring the hermaphroditic characteristics, size and age structures, growth and stock status of the two species of Polynemidae. 
 
 The arid Canning coast of north-western Australia, which lies between Cape Leveuque (16 degees 21'S, 123 degrees 02'E) and Cape Keraudren (19 degrees 57'S, 119 degrees 46'E),does not contain rivers and thus also estuaries, which traditionally provide alternative fish nursery areas to those found in nearshore waters. It is also subjected to some of the largest tides in the world. The fish faunas at three widely-separated locations, i.e. Port Smith, Eighty Mile Beach and Cape Keraudren, were sampled using seine and gill netting in their shallow, nearshore waters and rotenoning in intertidal pools at the first and third of those locations with the aim of determining the following. 1) The extents to which the diversity, abundance and species composition of the fish faunas of the Canning coast are influenced by location, habitat and time of year. 2) Which species use bare sand, mangroves and/or intertidal pools as nursery areas and which are permanent residents in one or more of those habitats. 3) Identification of the commercial and recreational fish species found in each of the above three habitat types and their relative abundance in those habitats. 
 
 The fish catches from all three sampling locations collectively yielded 170 species representing 66 families. The most abundant species (with % contributions) in seine net samples collected over unvegetated sand were Stolephorus carpentariae (19.1), Herklotsichthys blackburni (14.7) and Atherinomorus lacunosus (11.8), whereas those in gill net samples taken over the same substrate were Arius proximus (26.6), Eleutheronema tetradactylum (18.8) and Polydactylus macrochir (18.7) and in mangroves were A. proximus (38.9), Valamugil buchanani (18.8) and Scomberoides commersonnianus (18.7). Ambassis vachellii (32.5) and Craterocephalus capreoli (14.4) dominated the catches obtained from intertidal pools. 
 
 Fifty three of the 170 species that were caught are fished commercially and recreationally along the Canning coast and a further 17 fish species are caught solely by recreational fishers. The most abundant of these species were the polynemids E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, which are residents of nearshore waters, i.e. are found in these waters throughout the whole of their life cycle. Other species, such as Lutjanus russelli Epinephelus coioides and Sillago vittata, are present in nearshore waters only as juveniles and thus use these waters as a nursery. 
 
 The compositions of the ichthyofaunal samples collected by both seine and gill nets over bare sand differed markedly among locations. The compositions at Cape Keraudren, the most southerly location, were more similar to those at Port Smith, the most northerly and most protected location, than those that Eighty Mile Beach, the most exposed of the three locations. It is thus proposed that the compositions of the fish faunas found in nearshore, unvegetated waters along the Canning coast are influenced more by factors related to turbidity than those reflecting latitudinal position. The fish fauna at Eighty Mile Beach was distinguished by species typically associated with turbid waters, such as those of the Polynemidae and Sciaenidae and certain species of the Engraulidae, Ariidae, Mugilidae and Carcharhinidae. In contrast, many of those species were absent from catches made in the clearer waters of Port Smith, where the ichthyofauna was disitinguished by certain species of the Clupeidae and Atherinidae and other species associated with low turbidity, such as V. buchanani and Chanos chanos. 
 
 The compositions of the fish faunas sampled over bare sand by gill and seine nets underwent marked seasonal changes. Furthermore, these changes, particularly in the case of seine net catches, tended to undergo a conspicuous cyclical progression during the year as a result of time-staggered changes in the recruitment and emigration of certain species. The species responsible for seasonal differences in either the gill and/or seine net samples included nearshore residents, such as the clupeids H. blackburni and Spratelloides delicatulus, the polynemids E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, the engraulidid Thryssa hamiltonii and the atherinids A. lacunosus and C. capreoli, as well as species such as the sillaginid S. vittata, which use nearshore waters as a nursery area. At a broader level, the compositions of the fish sampled by gill net in the wet and dry periods were also distinct, reflecting, in particular, the influx of certain species during the wet period, e.g. mature ariid catfish and the juveniles of a number of elasmobranchs, such as the endangered Green Sawfish Pristis zijsron, aggregate in nearshore, shallow waters during this period. 
 
 The fish faunas of the intertidal pools at Port Smith and Cape Keraudren, which were sampled using rotenone, differed markedly from each other and from those over nearby bare sand substrates on the coast. The ichthyofauna of intertidal pools at Port Smith was distinguished from that at Cape Keraudren by relatively greater numbers of C. capreoli at the former location, whereas the opposite situation pertained with Amniataba caudavittatus, Acanthopagrus latus and L. macrolepis at Cape Keraudren. These differences were attributable to differences in habitat characteristics of intertidal pools, with pools at the former location containing clearer water and greater amounts of rock, while those at the latter contained mangroves. Few species were caught in both intertidal pools and in the surrounding shallow, nearshore waters, demonstrating that the rock pools provide an important habitat for certain fish species. 
 
 The composition of the fish fauna of intertidal pools at Port Smith underwent an essentially cyclical progression over the course of a year, reflecting the timing and strength of recruitment of the juveniles of the various species. The species responsible for this recruitment-related change in the fish fauna included both nearshore residents, such as A. vachellii, C. capreoli and A. lacunosus, as well as transient species that use intertidal pools as a nursery area, i.e. E. coioides and L. russelli. In contrast, the seasonal progression in species composition in intertidal pools at Cape Keraudren was largely related to the influence of a tropical cyclone. The fish community in the period immediately following the cyclone was depauparate and distinguished, from that before the cyclone, in particular by a lack of A. vachellii and A. latus. 
 
 The Blue and King Threadfins E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, which were among the most abundant species in the seine and gill net catches taken in unvegetated waters, are key species in the Kimberley Managed Gill Net and Barramundi Fishery (KMGBF) and important recreational target species. In addition, these species are an important source of food and of cultural significance for local indigenous communities. The importance of the shared nature of these resources and the marked fluctuations undergone by the catches of threadfin in recent years led to the second major component of this thesis, i.e. to obtain reliable data on the reproductive biology, age compositions, growth rates and mortality of E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, of the type that are required by managers for developing plans to conserve the stocks of these species in north-western Australia. 
 
 Length and age compositions of male, bisexual (i.e. possessing gonads comprising both testicular and ovarian tissue) and female E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, and histological characteristics of the gonads of the full size range of threadfin were examined and analysed. The results demonstrate that, in north-western Australian waters, each of these species is a protandrous hermaphrodite, i.e. individuals mature first as males before changing sex to female. Sexual maturity is attained by 50% of male E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir at ca 200 and 230 mm, respectively. For both species, these lengths approximate those attained towards the end of their first year of life. However, the lengths and ages at which these two species typically change sex differ markedly. 
 
 In the case of E. tetradactylum, transitional fish (i.e. those with bisexual gonads assumed to be changing sex) were most prevalent at total lengths between 300 and 400 mm. All fish greater than 450 mm total length possessed gonads that consisted exclusively of ovarian tissue. The L50 for sex change from male and transitional fish to females is ca 400 mm. Thus, the majority of E. tetradactylum change sex during their second or third years of life and males are rarely older than three years. In contrast, the range of lengths at which transitional individuals of P. macrochir were recorded was much broader than E. tetradactylum, i.e. between 310 and 1140 mm. The data on the prevalences of males and females in sequential age classes demonstrate that sex change can occur in P. macrochir as young as two years old and up to eight years old. The lengths at which E. tetradactylum changes sex in north-western Australia was relatively similar at all locations, whereas the L50 for sex change in P. macrochir varied markedly among sampling locations. For example, the L50 value for sex inversion was ca 790 mm at Derby, compared with ca 1160 mm at Anna Plains. The differences presumably reflect variations in environmental conditions at those localities. 
 
 Analysis of the ages of male, transitional and female E. tetradactylum revealed that the change from male to female by this species occurs over a period of ca 6 months. The presence of mature sperm in transitional gonads, in combination with trends exhibited by the GSIs of the testicular and ovarian portions of transitional gonads, demonstrate that, during the spawning season, transitional threadfin function as males. Analyses indicate that, once individual E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir change sex to become females, all individuals function as mature females during successive breeding seasons. Both species of threadfin have protracted spawning periods of ca 6 months. However, the monthly trends exhibited by the mean GSIs and the proportion of the various gonad stages show that the spawning of both species peaks during spring and early summer, i.e. September to December, and occurs on multiple occasions each year. 
 
 In north-western Australia, P. macrochir grows far larger and lives for longer than E. tetradactylum, a difference reflected in the maximum total lengths and ages recorded for these two species, i.e. 1393 mm and 10 years vs 793 mm and 6 years, respectively. In addition, P. macrochir grows faster than E. tetradactylum, attaining lengths of 322, 520 and 945 mm vs 245, 400 and 635 mm, by the end of years 1, 2 and 5, respectively. For both species, estimates of total, natural and fishing mortality were derived using different life history models, simulation based on the number of fish in samples above a specified age, relative abundance analyses and a Monte Carlo resampling approach. 
 
 The various biological parameters determined for E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, including the estimates of mortality, were incorporated into yield per recruit, spawning biomass per recruit and spawning potential ratio analyses to determine the current impacts of fishing on each species in north-western Australia. The results of these analyses indicate that E. tetradactylum is fully exploited and that P. macrochir is overexploited. The effectiveness of various management options is evaluated. 
 
 The data produced during the first part of this thesis on the diversity, abundance and species compositions of fish faunas in different nearshore habitats along the Canning coast of north-western Australia, and the way these faunas are influenced by season, provides fisheries and environmental managers with information that will enable them to develop management plans for these habitats and their fish species. In addition, the biological data for E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, and the results of the stock assessments performed on these species, will enable fisheries managers to develop plans for conserving the stocks of these two species in north-western Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/462/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Wigan Pier to Airstrip One: a critical evaluation of George Orwell's writing and politics post-September 11</field><field name="creator">Urry, David L.</field><field name="description">This thesis summons a contemporary reading of George Orwell, evaluating his current role and function as novelist, essayist, and twentieth century cultural icon. The year 2003 marked the centenary of Eric Blair's birth and proved a productive year for Blair (and Orwell) enthusiasts. After nearly three years of research, my journey through Orwell's words and world(s) has undergone significant re-evaluation, taking me far beyond such an appropriate commemoration. In the tragic aftermath of 9/11 - through Afghanistan and Iraq, Bali, Madrid, and London - Orwell's grimly dystopian vision acquires renewed significance for a new generation. Few writers (living or dead) are as enduringly newsworthy and malleable as George Orwell. The scope and diversity of his work - the sheer volume of his letters, essays, and assorted journalism - elicits a response from academics, journalists, critics and readers. My research, tempered by a 'War' on terror and a televisual Big Brother, shapes these responses at a time when 24-hour surveillance is viewed as the path to instant celebrity.
 
 Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four provides unique insights into a highly pervasive and secretive regime, which in light of post 9/11 political trajectories is highly admonitory. These pathways and connections are produced in my research. I do not make easy links between past and present - Eric and Tony Blair - at the level of metaphor or simile. Indeed, the pages that follow traverse the digital archives and probe the rationale for mobilising Orwell in this time and place. I am focussed on writing a history and establishing a context calibrated to the fictional Oceania. 
 
 This doctorate commenced as an investigation of George Orwell's journalism and fiction one hundred years after his birth. At the outset of the candidature, the Twin Towers fell and new implications and interpretations of Orwell arose. My research demonstrates that the Oceania of Orwell's imagining presents an evocative insight into the contemporary alliance forged by the Bush, Blair, and Howard triumvirate in its quest for world peace. Using Orwell as a guide, I move through theories of writing and politics, in the process uncovering capitalism's inherently hostile and negligent attitude towards those who are materially less fortunate. I began my work convinced of Orwell's relevance to cultural studies, particularly in understanding popular cultural writing and the need for social intervention. I concluded this process even more persuaded of my original intent, but shaped, sharpened and compensated by new events, insights, tragedies and Big Brothers.
 
 It is imperative for the future directives of cultural studies that critical, political, pedagogic and intellectual links with Orwell are (re-)formed, (re-)established and maintained. My text works in the spaces between cultural studies and cultural journalism, pondering the role and significance of the critical - and dissenting - intellectual. Memory, History, and Identity all circulate in Orwell's prose. These concerns and questions have provided impetus and direction for this thesis. They have also shaped the research.
 
 Few expect Orwell's totalitarian dystopia to materialise unchallenged from the pages of a book. The wielders of power are more capable and more subtle. Yet it is impossible to deny that the litany of lies and contempt central to Big Brother's Oceania is reproducible by any administration assisted by a complicit media and a malleable citizenry. The emergence of such a phenomenon has been well documented in the post 9/11 United States. This thesis has arisen out of the miasma of hubris, lies and contempt framing and surrounding Mr. Bush's war on terror. My purpose - not unlike Orwell's in Nineteen Eighty-Four - is to warn, not judge or berate. Orwell understood political rhetoric. He was not a prophet but a journalist who interpreted the nuances and temptations of excessive power. He had witnessed the extraordinary 'death' of history in Spain, and thereafter he raised his pen to combat intellectual hypocrisy and dishonesty wherever he found it. Under Orwell's tutelage, plain words pierce, probe and unsettle. They are sharp cutting instruments, fully capable of transcending time. How else are we to explain his enduring popularity as a writer? This thesis offers a critical and interpretative homage to George Orwell, a man who recognised the beauty of well chosen words, who loved and appreciated their enduring complexity and power.
 
 A framing structure has been chosen that places Orwell in close relation to poverty, class and politics, war and journalism. Individual chapter headings (and their contents) exploit Orwell's unique response to the significant talking points of his era. After resolving to write professionally, Orwell starved and struggled in Paris, and frequented 'doss houses' in and around London. I track these wanderings in chapter one. He studied the effects of the Depression and unemployment in Yorkshire and Lancashire (chapter two), and fought and was wounded in Spain (chapter three). Thereafter he turned to political writing and journalism (chapter four). What he failed to anticipate was a post war Britain overwhelmed by despondency and dissolved by internal devolution (chapter five). His concluding apocalyptic discharge, the dystopian Nineteen Eighty-Four, was directed at the higher echelons of institutional power and corporate corruption in Britain, America, and Europe, which I explore in chapter six.
 
 The world has changed significantly since Orwell (and J. B. Priestley) went in search of England's faltering 'pulse' in the 1930s. Englishness and traditional working class values have distorted and shifted in unexpected ways. These transformations are partly the result of war and the loss of empire. They are also a response to American cultural and economic hegemony, the privatisation of industry, offshore investments, the emergence of the European Economic Community, and the burgeoning global economy. George Orwell matters, even after this scale of change because he faced his own prejudices on the page and developed a writing style that enabled him to challenge the accepted orthodoxies and hypocrisies of his era. This is evident when returning to his essays and journalism, fifty-five years after his death. He possessed the ability to make readers feel uncomfortable, raising topics and concerns that we would rather not discuss. Denounced as a traitor by the pre-1956 unreconstructed left and feted as a hero by the self-congratulatory right, Orwell resists labelling and easy categorization. We owe him a considerable debt for exposing the likely directions of unchecked political ambition, and this insight should not be treated lightly. As I read him, Orwell was the last man in Europe, 'the canary in the mine.' He is a literary world heritage site of considerable iconic appeal and international significance. He is an outsider's 'outsider' perpetually facing inwards, and we need him now.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/463/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The white man never wanna hear nothin about what's different from him: representations of laws 'other' in Australian literature</field><field name="creator">Sidebotham, Naomi</field><field name="description">Law controls our everyday.  It regulates our lives.  It tells us what is and is not acceptable behaviour, it confers and protects our rights, and it punishes us for our indiscretions.  But law does much more than this.  It creates normative standards which shape the way people are treated and the way that we relate to each other and to society generally.  The law defines people.  It constructs identity.  And it creates the 'other'.  This is a legacy of positivism's insistence on identifying that which is 'inside' law, and so accorded legitimacy, and that which is not.  That which does not conform to law's constructed standards and values is identified as 'other' and marginalised and silenced.  In this thesis, I demonstrate the way that the law constructs 'other', in particular, the Aboriginal 'other'.  I consider the way that Aborigines have been defined by the law to show the consequences that this has had for Aboriginal people beyond the purely legal.  I argue that law's construction of Aboriginality has contributed to the marginalisation of Aboriginal people and their exclusion from many aspects of the legal and the social, and that it has silenced them within the dominant domain, denying them the ability to challenge the wrongs perpetrated against them.  I examine these issues through the medium of literature.  I argue that literature's contribution to exposing, critiquing and challenging law's construction of 'other' is invaluable.  It informs the reader about the way that the law has treated Aboriginal people and, more generally, about the structures and limitations of our positivist legal system.  It thereby contributes to the community's perception and understanding of the way the law works, and the impact that it has on the lives of its subjects.  Perhaps most importantly, it also educates towards social change and reform.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/465/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jacob Bronowski, the compassionate scientist</field><field name="creator">Sarfaty, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to analyse the life of Bronowski through his work and his discussions of his personal values, so the reader will gain an understanding of the creative imagination in science and art, as basic to human specificity.
 
 Jacob Bronowski was born in Lodz, Poland, in 1908, the eldest of three sons of Abram Bronowski and Celia Flatto. During WWI, Russia invaded Poland, the family moved to Germany, and in 1920, Abram who had a linen export business with England moved the family to England. Jacob, who spoke no English, went to the Central Foundation School in London, and on to Cambridge University, where he was a student of Jesus College, graduating with a PhD in Mathematics in 1933.
 
 Being in England gave Bronowski a light experience after the dark of Poland. England's civilized minds excited him and he was fascinated with the English language, which he described as boney, meaning the language, and the words, could be understood by topological (geometrical) structure. While at Cambridge, in companionship with another mathematician, William Empson, they edited a literary journal Experiment. This gives a lead to the creative mind which characterises the human species, a feature which Bronowski develops during the course of this thesis.
 
 During a daylight air raid on London in 1941, Bronowski married Rita Colin (Coblitz) sculptor, and they subsequently had four daughters, Lisa, Judith, Beth and Clare. In English schools, it was usual practice for boys to refer to each other by their surnames, and Bronowski, as a school boy and throughout the remainder of his life was known as Bruno, the Polish diminutive of Bronowski.
 
 When he was at Cambridge, Rita realised, that as a Jew, her husband was not going to be accepted as a Fellow of Jesus College, so he left Cambridge and over the years1945-1964 , when he worked for the Government in England, he developed a reputation as a lecturer, broadcaster, public educator, literary critic, mathematician and extensive writer.
 
 In the thesis, Bronowski's works are analysed including: Science and Human Values, The Poet's Defence, William Blake and the Age of Revolution, The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination, and the BBC TV production, The Ascent of Man, a Knowledge and Imagination, and the BBe TV production, The Ascent of Man, a thirteen part series about the development of animal and human life, from the grunion, a fish on the beaches of La Jolla, San Diego up through modem day studies in quantum physics and DNA structures.
 
 There is a seventh chapter which analyses, The Visionary Eye, a series of essays and lectures put together by his wife Rita in 1978 to show the bright ribbon of imagination in her late husband.
 
 I created the thesis title Jacob Bronowski, the Compassionate Scientist to reflect how his values, and activities and ethics reach out to me and touch me. Bronowski's belief that being a Jew meant to me having a profound sense of intellectual values. It meant being tolerant of the thoughts of other minds, not out of indifference, but of respect, above all out of self respect ..... ethical values of Judaism state we are all responsible for each other. (Bronowski, 1968: On Being a Jew).
 
 These values led Bronowski out of the shock of seeing the destruction of Nagasaki from the atomic bomb, through his thoughts on the Spanish civil war, and the propaganda of Nazism, out of the ashes of Auschwitz (part 11 of The Ascent of Man) to become involved in human biology, meeting with Jonas Salk and joining the Salk Institute in 1964.
 
 Writing the thesis has given meaning to my life, about optimism, courage and ethical values, and I do trust it will convey those values to the readers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/466/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The discourse of conflict</field><field name="creator">Hately, Warren</field><field name="description">This dissertation deals with two problems central to contemporary philosophy: the unacknowledged bias of structuralist theory towards linguistic signs and the lack of a coherent theorisation of social conflict. In order to address these conundrums, I reconcile Saussurean and Peircean semiotics and then use Ruthrof's corporeal pragmatics to break from the verbocentric idea of language as a closed system, showing instead that verbal meanings originate from the body, its senses and its imagination, as informed by the deixis of individual communities. With the transformation of linguistic semiotics into corporeality, Foucault's notion of discourse and the neglected category of discursive practice are then reworked to show how statements based on nonverbal signs might function discursively. 
 
 The culmination of the 1970s Northern Irish prison war in the events of the 1981 hunger strikes offers a study that unites the focus upon nonverbal discourses with the examination of conflict. In exploring the ways in which republican hunger strikers struggled for legitimacy with the prison authorities, I am able to show how previous notions of conflict, especially Lyotard's differend, are thrown into disrepute by a corporeal perspective recognising the intersemiotic and heterosemiotic character of communication. The availability of diverse semiotic media such as the visual, the haptic, the proximic, etc., offers positions in which conflicts may be regulated without ending in the stalemate that Lyotard describes. The division of semio-discursive phenomena into verbal and nonverbal elements, and the tracing of the effects that these elements have upon ideational and pragmatic planes of action, also reveal a variety of strategies related to conflict that are superposable upon other instances. As a result, the thesis suggests that the role of political violence in politics and the meanings associated with the taking of life can be approached from a new angle.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/467/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalisation: case studies of two Australian and United States universities</field><field name="creator">Ruddy, Annie</field><field name="description">Higher education has undergone significant change as universities have sought to respond to government reforms in a period of globalisation. One major reform that globalisation has introduced is the reduction in state funding for higher education. Universities have turned to other resources to provide funding and one of these is the recruitment of international students. The focus of this thesis is on contrasting the internationalisation policies of two nations, Australia and the United States, by analysing published policies, statistics and carrying out interviews on two campuses. Two universities, one in Australia and the other in the United States, served as case studies to examine the strategies used to implement these policies. Approximately 100 participants were interviewed, including administrators and faculty members, international and domestic students.
 
 Each university featured internationalisation as a goal in its mission statement. By integrating intercultural and global dimensions into the teaching, research and service functions of a university, internationalisation encompasses a multitude of activities that provide an educational experience. While administrators generally stated that the implementation of strategic plans to achieve international goals had been successful, many faculty members, domestic and international students were of the view that international goals were yet to be realised. These contrasting discourses revealed that each university was falling short of achieving its internationalisation goals. Faculty members and domestic and international students expressed dissatisfaction about cultural insensitivity, lack of adequate services that offered housing and emotional/social support, and language barriers. At the same time, each university was achieving some of its internationalisation goals. In conclusion, strategies are suggested that might improve the implementation of internationalisation at both universities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/469/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of parks : a history of Tasmania's national parks 1885-2005</field><field name="creator">Quarmby, Debbie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the history of Tasmania's national parks and protected areas from 1885-2005, analysing the interests, and the organisations and individuals representing them, which have influenced outcomes. Significant organisations representing different and sometimes competing interests have been community based groups, chiefly the naturalist and scientific bodies, bushwalking clubs and environmental organisations; tourism associations, industry interests, notably forestry, mining and hydro-electricity, federal, local and state governments and government agencies, notably the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The thesis argues that the establishment and development of Tasmania's national parks and protected areas have been shaped by the negotiations, accommodations, conflicts and shifting relative power among these competing interests.
 
 In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries consensus of interest among Tasmania's social and political elite facilitated the declaration of Tasmania's first scenery reserves and national parks. Conflicts of interest between preserving land in its natural state and industrial development grew apparent from the 1920s however, and Tasmanian governments managed park expansion through politics of compromise in which national parks accommodated industry demands. The environment movement that emerged in the 1960s protested national parks' 'residual' status and with federal government support defeated the State government's plan to build a dam within an area proposed for a Wild Rivers National Park. Following environmentalists' success in over-riding State government processes to expand the State's national park estate and World Heritage Area in the early 1980s; the State government strengthened its direct control over the National Parks and Wildlife Service and focused its attention on national parks' tourism role. Aspects of tourism in national parks are, however, incompatible with the preservation of environmental and wilderness values, which resulted in further political conflict between government-supported tourism interests and the national parks movement.  
 
 This thesis complements earlier research on Tasmanian national park history by Mosley, Castles, Shackel, Mendel and Cubit by extending analysis of that history to the twenty-first century, examining the role of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in that history since the agency's inception in 1971, and addressing both environmental and social perspectives of national park history. It concludes that by the twenty-first century Tasmanian national park policy required a framework of social values associated with national parks in which to situate environmental protection as national parks' primary purpose.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/470/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron-helium scattering using analytical and numerical wave functions</field><field name="creator">Kaur, Gurdeep</field><field name="description">Theoretical investigations of electron-inert gas scattering are challenging because of the complex target structure. The electron-Helium system has been the most studied both at low and intermediate energies by sophisticated R-matrix and coupled channels methods. For the other inert gases, few calculations have been attempted at the same level sophistication. One problem is that general target-structure codes provide different forms of wave functions that must be interfaced with the scattering equations. The theoretical work presented in this thesis is based on the momentum-space coupled channels equations. For this formalism only one and two-electron atoms have been studied and purpose-built routines, specific to these atoms, have been developed. For the inert gases however such a task is much more formidable and a more practical approach is to use existing structure codes that have taken several man-years to develop. 
 
 The framework of this thesis comprises of two parts. In the first part we discuss the need for, and the way to, modify the existing close-coupling code developed by Berge &amp; Stelbovics in order to interface with other atomic structure packages in the literature. Two mainstream packages, an atomic structure package of Charlotte Froese Fischer and an atomic structure of Alan Hibbert are discussed. Methods to extract the wave functions for Helium and Neon targets using Hibbert's package are given. In the second part, various options and strategies for the calculation of the target structure, including frozen-core and configuration-interaction wave functions, using analytic Slater, Laguerre or numerical orbitals are considered for the Helium target. Hibbert's structure code wave functions are shown to be correctly interfaced into our momentum-space coupled channels code. The pros and cons of the various target structure descriptions are given and applied for lowenergy elastic and inelastic scattering of electron from Helium.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/472/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Song sharing and repertoire change as indicators of social structure in the Noisy Scrub-bird</field><field name="creator">Berryman, Abby N.</field><field name="description">The Endangered Noisy Scrub-bird is a small passerine that is seldom seen but often heard in its range on the south coast of Western Australia. The difficulties in observing this cryptic bird mean that little is known about its social system. The loud, conspicuous territorial song of the male provides a convenient, non-intrusive means by which to study this species. 
 
 The aim of this project was to investigate the patterns of song sharing and repertoire change in the Noisy Scrub-bird to provide indications of the social structure. It was found that groups of up to ten territorial males shared the same set of about five song types. Song groups were discrete, with members of a song group sharing most, if not all, of their song types. Males from different song groups had no song types in common. 
 
 Repertoire change was rapid and, with the exception of one individual, was found in every territorial male studied in the Mt Gardner population. It occurred simultaneously in all members of a song group, with males making the same changes to their shared songs. The source of repertoire change was mainly modification of existing song types with occasional divergence of a single song type into two distinct song types, as well as some innovation providing new song types. The average life of a song type was approximately 6 months. Although some song types persisted for the entire 16 month sampling period, they were continually modified and a year later could no longer be recognised as the same type. 
 
 Translocation of eight male scrub-birds to the Porongurup National Park provided an opportunity to combine individuals that initially did not share any songs. This allowed the process of song group formation to be studied. Within a one to two month period these males altered their songs so that they shared with their new neighbours. There was some evidence that the songs of dominant males were copied. Observation of the population established on Bald Island by translocation confirmed that there were no appreciable long-term effects on the songs of translocated Noisy Scrub-birds. Song group size, repertoire size and levels of song sharing were very similar to those found in the Mt Gardner population. 
 
 The striking feature of Noisy Scrub-bird song groupings was their discreteness and cohesiveness even in the presence of continual repertoire change. It is suggested that each song group consists of a dominant male whose songs are more attractive to females and/or effective in territory defence. This dominant male is surrounded by subordinate males that copy his effective songs. Repertoire change can be explained by the dominant male continually making changes to his songs, with the other males copying these changes to retain their mimicked effectiveness. Each song group may in fact represent a dispersed lek. The scenario suggested to explain Noisy Scrub-bird song groupings bears striking similarities to the hotshot hypothesis to explain lek formation whereby males cluster around a successful male. 
 
 This study demonstrates the potential of using song to investigate aspects of the social system of a species which is otherwise very difficult to observe. Management of an Endangered species such as the Noisy Scrub-bird will always benefit from increased knowledge about their social system. For example, this study showed that taking males from different song groups for translocation probably has little impact on their success at the new site because of their ability to rapidly alter their songs to form new song groups. An additional benefit of regularly monitoring the songs of translocated males was that it allowed ongoing identification of individuals, even though their songs were continually changing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/473/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Western barred bandicoots in health and disease</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Mark</field><field name="description">For more than a decade, community groups, scientific organizations and government agencies have collaborated to repopulate the endangered western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville). While initially successful, the unexpected discovery of a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in captive and wild populations of P. bougainville exposed a dearth of knowledge regarding their diseases. This dissertation addresses this issue through study of the clinical pathology, immunology, parasitology, and virology of P. bougainville. 
 
 To facilitate the detection and understanding of diseases in P. bougainville, guidelines for interpreting haematology and clinical chemistry results were developed, including calculated species-specific reference intervals for plasma aspartate transaminase activity (20-283 U/L), haemoglobin (122-165 g/L), haematocrit (0.36-0.49 L/L), total leukocytes (2.9-14.9 x10^9/L), monocytes (0-0.6 x10^9/L), eosinophils (0-0.9 x10^9/L) and total protein (47-63 g/L) estimated by refractometry. P. bougainville immunoglobulin was also fractionated from plasma and inoculated into sheep to derive antiserum for serological screening assays. 
 
 Arthropods, helminths and protozoa parasitic on P. bougainville were catalogued and Eimeria kanyana n. sp. was formally described. The pathogenic and zoonotic potential of bacteria detected in ticks parasitic on P. bougainville was also considered. 
 
 The association between bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV1) and the western barred bandicoot papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome was investigated using PCR, in situ hybridization and virus isolation. Optimized in situ hybridization techniques demonstrated BPCV1 DNA within keratinocyte and sebocyte nuclei, and BPCV1 mRNA within the cytoplasm. BPCV1 virions were isolated by ultracentrifugation and visualized with negative stain transmission electron microscopy revealing icosahedral, non-enveloped viral capsids ~47 nm in diameter, comparable to viruses classified within Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae. 
 
 A novel virus, tentatively named bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 2 (BPCV2) was discovered in papillomatous lesions from a southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus). It had a circular double-stranded DNA genome of 7277 bp, and encoded two papillomavirus-like structural proteins, L1 and L2, and two polyomavirus-like putative transforming proteins, large T antigen and small t antigen. DNA and RNA in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of BPCV2 nucleic acids within lesion biopsies. The discovery of the bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis viruses has provoked reassessment of the established virus taxonomy paradigm, theories of virus-host co-speciation and bandicoot population management strategies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/474/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinetics of the dissolution of chalcopyrite in chloride media</field><field name="creator">Velasquez Yevenes, Lilian</field><field name="description">One of the most important outstanding problems with the hydrometallurgy of copper is the low temperature leaching of chalcopyrite. In this thesis, a fundamental study at low temperature was undertaken in order to establish a mechanism, which is consistent with the data obtained in an extensive study of the kinetics of dissolution of several chalcopyrite concentrates.
 
 It will be demonstrated that enhanced rates of dissolution can be achieved at ambient temperatures by the application of controlled potentials in the range 560-650 mV, depending on the concentration of chloride ions. However, control of the potential by the use of electrochemical or chemical oxidation of iron(II) or copper(I) ions is ineffective unless carried out in the presence of dissolved oxygen. The rates of dissolution are approximately constant for up to 80% dissolution for sized fractions of the concentrates with an activation of energy of about 75 kJ mole-1. Chalcopyrite from different sources appears to dissolve at approximately the same rate which is largely independent of the iron and copper ion concentrations, the acidity and chloride ion concentration but depends in some cases on the presence of additives such as fine pyrite or silver ions.
 
 Based on the results of these leaching experiments and detailed mineralogical analyses of the residues, a mechanism involving non-oxidative dissolution of the mineral coupled to oxidation of the product hydrogen sulfide will be proposed. The latter reaction is shown to occur predominantly by a copper ion - catalyzed reaction with dissolved oxygen. The results of an independent study of the kinetics of this reaction will be presented which will demonstrate that the rates are consistent with those obtained for the dissolution of the mineral. The possible involvement of a covellite-like surface layer on the chalcopyrite under some conditions will also be discussed as it relates to the mechanism. It will also be shown that fine pyrite particles can also act as a catalyst surface for the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. This mechanism is consistent with the mineralogy which confirmed the formation of secondary sulfur which is not associated with chalcopyrite but is associated with fine pyrite if present.
 
 A comparison of this mechanism with that proposed in other more limited studies of the dissolution of chalcopyrite under similar conditions in sulfate solutions has been made.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/475/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">People in context: critical social dimensions in complex landscape systems</field><field name="creator">Wardell-Johnson, Angela</field><field name="description">Landscape-based approaches to solving environmental issues have been widely recommended by scientists and policy makers. These issues are found at the interface of social and ecological systems. Understanding the social dimensions of landscape issues has been suggested as part of the solution. This doctoral research integrated theoretical concepts with survey-based numerical taxonomy and qualitative analysis to explore three social dimensions underpinning decision-making at the landscape scale in rural Australia.
 
 These linked social dimensions that provided a research focus were sense of place and accompanying social capital that is embedded within private, social and institutional practice in discourses of the environment. Complex systems theory provided the framework to explore the interactions and relationships between these dimensions and to describe the emergent processes.
 
 The first phase of this research developed theoretically and empirically derived conceptual models for the three dimensions. These models provided a basis for operationalisation for the survey-based numerical taxonomy in the second phase. Data for this analysis was collected through survey questionnaires (124 returned with 60% response rate) from two social catchments (the Katanning Zone in the Blackwood Basin in Western Australia and the Condamine Headwaters in the upper reaches of the Murray Darling Basin in Queensland). The results from the numerical taxonomy provided a focus for semi-structured interviews (24 representative participants) that provided further analysis through qualitative methods in the third phase.
 
 Combining conceptual models with quantitative and qualitative analysis was used to expose three emergent processes that maintain resilience in these landscape systems. The first was formed through the interactive social relationships between communities of place, identity and interest that constitute social catchments. The second emergent process formed at the nexus of local, scientific and Indigenous frameworks of knowledge. The interactive social catchment relationships and three knowledge frameworks dictated the relative weightings of social, ecological and economic values of the triple bottom line, which formed the third emergent process. It is suggested that the interactions of these emergent processes characterised resilience in these systems.
 
 The social dimensions in this thesis provided a focus that suggests that the interactions between community in a social catchment governs the predominance of knowledge form and the accommodation of the values in the triple bottom line. The integration of theoretical, quantitative and qualitative approaches can be couched within a complex systems framework. This contributes to a re-framing of the social relationships in landscapes to identify social catchments as the appropriate focus for interaction in decision-making at the landscape scale.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/476/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolism and infection in the stagonospora nodorum-wheat pathosystem</field><field name="creator">Waters, Ormonde Dominick</field><field name="description">Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, and the causal agent of stagonospora nodorum blotch of wheat. Despite the economic importance of this disease, the molecular basis of the pathosystem is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between metabolism and infection in this pathosystem, with particular reference to the metabolism of mannitol.
 
 In common with many fungi, the main metabolite produced by S. nodorum is the acyclic hexitol mannitol. Among the previously suggested roles for this compound is a role in pathogenicity. The metabolism of mannitol has been hypothesised as occurring in a cycle involving the enzymes mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (Mdh1) and mannitol 1-phosphate 5 dehydrogenase (Mpd1). A strain was created harbouring disruption constructs for both of these genes. The double mutant was unable to synthesise or catabolise mannitol, and was unable to sporulate. Addition of exogenous mannitol completely restored in vitro sporulation, and partially restored in planta sporulation. This demonstrated an essential role for mannitol in asexual sporulation. This is the first demonstrated role for this compound.
 
 A 13C NMR study of the wild type strain, the mdh1 and mpd1 single mutants, and mpd1mdh1 double mutant was undertaken to investigate carbon utilisation and cycling. Disruption of Mpd1 significantly altered the metabolite profile with the mpd1 mutants producing trehalose and glycerol in place of mannitol. Labelling patterns in the double mutant showed that scrambling of label can be explained by the triosephosphate isomerase triangle and pentose phosphate pathway. This suggests the contribution of mannitol to label scrambling has been overstated in previous studies.
 
 The evidence did not support the metabolism of mannitol in S. nodorum as occurring in a cycle, but rather as two separate pathways.

Specimens of the 19 nominal species of the genus Acanthopleura, together with those from five widely disparate, geographic populations of one of these species (A. gemmata), along with specimens of the outgroup, Onithochiton quercinus Gould, 1846), have been utilised.
 
 A consideration of gross morphological characters, including features of the valves, girdle armature and gills, clearly separate A. rehderi from Acanthopleura, aligning it with Onithochiton. They also suggest the synonymy of two pairs of species (A. haddoni/A. vaillantii and A. testudo/A. brevispinosa), and indicate that A. loochooana is closely aligned with species previously assigned to Squamopleura (A. araucariana, A. curtisiana and A. miles).
 
 Examination of microstructural characters of the intermediate valve, including features of the tegmental micro architecture, the ocelli, the aesthetes and the central anterior eaves, confirm the conclusions of the gross morphological study, and, in addition, indicate a close relationship between A. echinata and A. nigra.
 
 Investigation of the girdle armature indicates that Acanthopleura can be divided into four groups based on the possession of predominantly scales, spines, spinelets or spicules. However, there is wide intraspecific variation with regard to micro  architecture of the girdle elements. This section confirms the close relationships of A. haddoni/A. vaillantii and A. testudo/A. brevispinosa, and suggests affiliations between other species.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/479/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acting your age: a study of the relationship between online social interaction and identity in older adults</field><field name="creator">Dell, Peter Thorlai</field><field name="description">This study combined quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the relationship between Internet use and identity, particularly age-identity, in older Internet users. It has a theoretical basis in symbolic interactionism - particularly the theories of Erving Goffman - and conceptualizes identities as roles that are negotiated during social interaction. 
 
 The focus on older users was motivated by the strong focus of prior Internet research on younger users. Few studies have examined older users specifically, and fewer still have examined age-identity. 
 
 Thus, the focus in this study is on how changes in social interaction that occur due to Internet use affect the identity negotiation process. The research is focused around two key areas: whether older users experience the same kinds of online identity processes as younger users, and the impact exposure to novel audiences has on identity negotiation. 
 
 The study consists of two phases. In the first, a quantitative survey was administered in which a measure of age-identity was assessed and compared with measures of audience novelty. Results showed that a significant increase in variance of ageidentity is associated with communication with people from other countries. This finding supports the theory that identity is formed in negotiation with the audience with whom one communicates, and that expanding this audience may lead to identity effects. 
 
 To investigate this issue more deeply, a qualitative phase was conducted in which participants were interviewed using rapid ethnography techniques, and at the conclusion of which a model of the interaction between age-identity and Internet communication was developed. This model was then verified with follow-up interviews with key informants and with field observations from sites of online social interaction among seniors. 
 
 The model developed during the qualitative stage identifies three ways in which ageidentity is influenced by social interaction on the Internet. First, the Internet is used in response to emotional or practical consequences of ageing. Second, older Internet users could take advantage of the ability to manage their personal front online to achieve agelessness, and third, the Internet is used as a backstage area to discuss ageidentity issues. The context of these claims is all-important; each individual's unique circumstances, emotions and motivations influence the way in which they will use the Internet and respond to others encountered through it. 
 
 The extension of Goffman's dramaturgical metaphor to age - identity on the Internet and to include the concept of character development, in which identity evolves over time in response to inner tensions and external events, is a tentative but powerful finding. It poses a challenge for future research into the nature of identity change, both online and offline.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/480/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of three teleost species with divergent life cycle characteristics and their implications for fisheries management</field><field name="creator">Coulson, Peter Graham</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis was to determine the size and age compositions, growth and reproductive biology of Western Blue Groper (Achoerodus gouldii), Blue Morwong (Nemadactylus valenciennesi) and Yellowtail Flathead (Platycepahlus endrachtensis) in south-western Australian waters, in which these three species have divergent life cycle characteristics. As A. gouldii and N. valenciennesi are commercially and recreationally important in coastal waters and P. endrachtensis is one of the most recreationally important species in the Swan River Estuary, these biological data were then used to produce estimates of mortality and spawning stock biomass per recruit for each of these species. The biological data and stock assessment parameters were finally employed comparatively to ascertain whether any of the three species possessed characteristics that would make them particularly susceptible to the effects of fishing and whether there was evidence that any of the species is fully or even overexploited. 
 
 Achoerodus gouldii typically uses reefs in protected inshore waters along the coast and around neighbouring islands as a nursery habitat and then, as it increases in size, moves to deeper, offshore reefs, where it spawns between early winter and mid-spring. The maximum total length and age of A. gouldii were 1162 mm and 70 years, the latter being the greatest age by far yet recorded for any species of labrid. However, most growth occurs in the first 20 years of life. Histological and demographic analyses demonstrated that all individuals begin life as females and, after attaining maturity, many become males, i.e. A. gouldii is a monandric protogynous hermaphrodite. The L50 at maturity and sex change were 653 and 821 mm, respectively, which correspond to ages of c. 17 and 37 years, respectively. As sex change took place over a narrower range in lengths (650 to 900 mm) than in ages (15 to 49 years), that change is apparently related more to size than age. Since sex change is typically accompanied by a change from green to blue, body colour can be used as a proxy for determining the length (L50) at which females change to males. von Bertalanffy growth curves fitted to the lengths at age of individuals of each sex of this hermaphroditic species using a novel technique demonstrated that, with increasing age, the lengths of males became increasingly greater than those of females. Thus, at ages 15, 30 and 60 years, the estimated lengths at age of females were c. 600, 670 and 680 mm, respectively, whereas those of males were c. 695, 895 and 975 mm, respectively. 
 
 As A. gouldii is very long-lived and sexual maturity, and even more particularly sex change, occur late, this labrid is potentially very susceptible to overfishing. Thus, because the mortality estimates and per recruit analyses indicated that, at present, this species is close to or fully exploited, fisheries managers will need to take a precautionary and watchful approach to managing and thus conserving the stocks of this species. 
 
 As with A. gouldii, N. valenciennesi moves to deeper, offshore waters as it increases in size and then matures and spawns in those waters. Although N. valenciennesi has a maximum length of nearly 1 m and thus, like A. gouldii, is moderately large, it has a far shorter life span, i.e. 19 vs 70 years. While female N. valenciennesi does not grow to as large a size as its males (max. lengths = 846 and 984 mm, respectively), the maximum age of both sexes was 19 years. From the growth curves, the females by ages 3, 6 and 10 years havd attained, on average, lengths of 435, 587 and 662 mm, respectively, compared with 446, 633 and 752 mm, respectively, for males. Both sexes grew little after 10 years of age. 
 
 Juvenile N. valenciennesi &lt; 400 mm in total length were found exclusively in shallow, coastal waters on the south coast, whereas their adults were abundant in offshore waters of both the south and lower west coasts. The females and males typically mature in offshore waters of the south coast at lengths of c. 600-800 mm and ages of c. 7-9 years. In contrast, the vast majority of females caught in offshore waters of the lower west coast (where they were of a similar length and age range to those in offshore waters on the south coast) became mature at lengths of 400-600 mm and 3-4 years of age. The attainment of maturity by N. valenciennesi at far lesser lengths and ages on the lower west coast than south coast suggests that the former coast provides better environmental conditions for the gonadal maturation and spawning of this species. Furthermore, the contrast between the almost total absence of the juveniles of N. valenciennesi in nearshore waters on the lower west coast and their substantial numbers in comparable waters on the south coast indicates that the larvae of this species produced on the lower west coast are transported southwards to the south coast, where they become juveniles. As spawning occurs between mid-summer and late autumn, the larvae, which spend a protracted period in the plankton, would be exposed, on the lower west coast, to the influence of the southwards-flowing Leeuwin Current at the time when that current is at its strongest. 
 
 Although N. valenciennesi is caught by recreational line fishing and commercial gillnet fishing when they are as young as 3-4 years old, they do not become fully vulnerable to these fisheries until they are about 9 years old. Consequently, the individuals of this species can potentially breed over a number of years before they become particularly prone to capture by fishers. Mortality estimates and per recruit analyses suggested that N. valenciennesi in south-western Australia is not currently overfished. A greater resilience to fishing by N. valenciennesi than A. gouldii presumably reflects, in part, its far shorter lifespan, earlier maturity and possession of gonochorism rather than hermaphroditism. 
 
 Platycephalus endrachtensis spawns in the Swan River Estuary between late spring and early autumn and completes the whole of its life cycle in this system. Although females attain a far larger length (615 mm) than males (374 mm), females and males were present in each age class. These data, together with a detailed examination of histological sections of a wide size and age range of individuals, demonstrated that this species, unlike some of its relatives, is not a protandrous hermaphrodite, i.e. it does not change from male to female with increasing body size. The combination of the presence of females and males in all age classes and the observation that all of the large number of individuals between 374 and 615 mm were females shows that the far greater length attained by that sex is largely related to its faster growth rate. The fact that females outnumbered males in each age class of P. endrachtensis in which the sample size was substantial, i.e. &gt; 25, with the overall sex ratio being 2.7 females: 1 male, indicate that there has been strong selection for egg production in this species. As the minimum legal length for retention of P. endrachtensis is 300 mm, and relatively few males exceeded this length, the recreational fishery which targets this species is based largely on its females. 
 
 The estimates of mortality and results of per recruit analyses provided no evidence that P. endrachtensis is currently overfished. From a management point of view, it is advantageous that the current size limit for this species exceeds the average length at which its females (259 mm) attain maturity. Furthermore, this species appears to be resilient to capture and release. 
 
 The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that A. gouldii possesses biological characteristics which make it potentially more prone to the effects of fishing than is the case with either N. valenciennesi or P. endrachtensis. This presumably accounts, at least in part, for the indications that A. gouldii is the only one of these three species that is likely to be close to or at full exploitation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/481/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hearing loss technology and community at the start of the twenty first century</field><field name="creator">Collins, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis explores ways in which technology is influencing the lives of hard of hearing people at the start of the 21st century.  The thesis develops and is grounded in a distinction between people who referred to as 'deaf' and those who are referred to as 'hard of hearing.'  It is argued that there is a lack of recognition of the special needs of hard of hearing people in deaf and disability discourses and more generally in everyday communication.  This lack of recognition is analogous to the absence of women from many forms of social analysis until the latter part of the 20th century.  In light of this clearer specification of the people under consideration, attention shifts to a consideration of the various technologies they can access.  The context within which these technologies are used is one in which, unlike many deaf people who form an integrated community that is differentiated and separate from the general society, hard of hearing people have tended to become socially isolated within the hearing community.  This understanding of the potential for social isolation allows the specific significance of generic computer technology for this group to come to the fore.  As a consequence the thesis focuses upon a detailed examination of the place of a hard of hearing online real community in the lives of a number of hard of hearing people.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/482/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitric oxide and central autonomic control of blood pressure: a neuroanatomical study of nitric oxide and cGMP expression in the brain and spinal cord</field><field name="creator">Powers-Martin, Kellysan</field><field name="description">Essential hypertension is defined as a chronic elevation of blood pressure of unknown cause.  Though a definitive trigger for this change in blood pressure has not been established, there is a strong association with an upregulation of sympathetic output from the central nervous system.  There are a number of central autonomic nuclei involved in the maintenance of blood pressure, including the brainstem regions of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) within the intermediolateral cell column (IML) of the spinal cord, as well as forebrain regions such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus.  Within these centers, a vast number of neurotransmitters have been identified that contribute to the control of blood pressure, including glutamate, angiotensin II, serotonin, neurotensin, neuropeptide Y, opioids and catecholamines.  Recognition of the role of nitric oxide (NO) and its multiple influences over the neural control of blood pressure is gaining increasing significance.
 
 Nitric oxide is a unique modulatory molecule that acts as a non-conventional neurotransmitter.  As NO is a gas with a short half-life of 4 - 6 seconds, its' synthesising enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is often used as a marker of location of production.  Once activated, the best-known 'receptor' for NO is soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which drives the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).  Identifying the presence of cGMP can therefore be used to determine sites receptive to NO.  Previous studies examining the role of NO in the central autonomic control of blood pressure have focused predominantly upon application of either excitatory or inhibitory drugs into the key central autonomic regions and assessing pressor or depressor effects.  This thesis aims instead to study the neuroanatomical relationship and functional significance of NO and cGMP expression in the brain and spinal cord of a hypertensive and normotensive rat model.
 
 In the first experimental chapter (Chapter 3), a comparative neuroanatomical analysis of neuronal NOS expression and its relationship with cGMP in the SPN of mature Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) and their controls, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) was undertaken.  Fluorescence immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of nNOS in the majority of SPN located within the IML region of both strains.  However, a strain specific anatomical arrangement of SPN cell clusters was evident and while there was no significant difference between the total number of SPN in each strain, there were significantly fewer nNOS positive SPN in the SHR animals.  All nNOS positive SPN were found to express cGMP, and a novel subpopulation of nNOS negative, cGMP-positive SPN was identified. These cells were located in the medial edge of the IML SPN cell group.  These results suggest that cGMP is a key signalling molecule in SPN, and that a reduced number of nNOS positive SPN in the SHR may be associated with the increase in sympathetic tone seen in essential hypertension.
 
 The second experimental chapter (Chapter 4) aimed to determine if reduced numbers of nNOS containing SPN translated into reduced detectable cGMP.  The functional significance of cGMP signalling in the two strains was then examined. Based on previous work by our group, it was predicted that reduced nNOS in the SHR would translate into reduced cGMP and that intrathecal administration of exogenous cGMP in the spinal cord would drive a differential pressor response in the two animal strains.  Immunohistochemical techniques confirmed that within each SPN, the relative level of cGMP expression was significantly reduced in the SHR when compared to the WKY.  Intrathecal application of 8-bromo-cGMP, a drug analogous to cGMP, increased blood pressure in both strains and had a differential and dose dependent effect, causing only a small increase in blood pressure in anaesthetised WKY animals, while driving a significant pressor response in the SHR.  This finding raised the novel hypothesis that in the SHR, reduced nNOS expression is not a driver of hypertension, but is instead a protective mechanism limiting the potent pressor effects of cGMP within SPN.
 
 The third experimental chapter (Chapter 5) examines the expression of neuronal and inducible isoforms of NOS (nNOS, iNOS) within the RVLM of SHR and WKY rats.  Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyse the level of mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry was then used to further analyse protein levels of nNOS.  Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed from the RVLM of mature male WKY and SHR.  Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that relative to WKY, mRNA levels for nNOS was significantly higher in RVLM of the SHR.  This was confirmed immunohistochemically.  When compared to iNOS, nNOS was expressed at significantly higher levels overall, however there was no difference in iNOS mRNA expression between the two strains.  This demonstration of differential expression levels of nNOS and iNOS in the RVLM raises the possibilities that (i) NO production is up-regulated in the RVLM in SHR in response to increased sympathetic activity in order to re-establish homeostatic balance or alternatively that (ii) an alteration in the balance between nNOS and iNOS activity may underlie the genesis of augmented sympathetic vasomotor tone during hypertension.
 
 The fourth experimental chapter (Chapter 6) extends the observations in Chapter 5 through examination of the expression of cGMP and sGC within the RVLM.  There is strong functional evidence to suggest that NO signalling in the RVLM relies on cGMP as an intracellular signalling molecule and that this pathway is impaired in hypertension.  Immunohistochemistry was used to assess cGMP expression as a marker of active NO signalling in the C1 region of the RVLM, again comparing SHR and WKY animals.  Fluorescence immunohistochemistry on sections of the RVLM, double labelled for cGMP and either nNOS or phenylethylamine methyl-transferase (PNMT) failed to reveal cGMP positive neurons in the RVLM from aged animals of either strain, despite consistent detection of cGMP immunoreactivity neurons in the nucleus ambiguus from the same or adjacent sections.  This was demonstrated both in the presence and absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and in young vs. aged animals.  In-vitro incubation of RVLM slices in the NO donor DETA-NO or NMDA did not reveal any additional cGMP neuronal staining within the RVLM.  In all studies, cGMP was prominent within the vasculature.  Soluble guanylate cyclase immunoreactivity was found throughout the RVLM, although it did not co-localise with the PNMT or nNOS neuronal populations.  Overall, results suggest that within the RVLM, cGMP is not detectable in the resting state and cannot be elicited by phosphodiesterase inhibition, NMDA receptor stimulation or NO donor application. A short time course of cGMP signalling or degradation not inhibited by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor utilised (IBMX) in the RVLM cannot be excluded.
 
 The final experimental chapter (Chapter 7) examines cGMP expression in magnocellular and preautonomic parvocellular neurons of the PVN.  Retrograde tracing techniques and immunohistochemistry were used to visualise cGMP immunoreactivity within functionally, neurochemically and topographically defined PVN neuronal populations in Wistar rats.  Basal cGMP immunoreactivity was readily observed in the PVN, both in neuronal and vascular profiles.  Cyclic GMP immunoreactivity was significantly higher in magnocellular compared to preautonomic neuronal populations.  In preautonomic neurons, the level of cGMP expression was independent on their subnuclei location, innervated target or neurochemical phenotype.  The data presented in this chapter indicates a highly heterogeneous distribution of basal cGMP levels within the PVN, and supports work by others indicating that constitutive NO inhibitory actions on preautonomic PVN neurons are likely mediated indirectly through activation of interneurons.
 
 Summary
 Together, these studies comprise a detailed analysis of the neuroanatomical expression of NO and its signalling molecule cGMP in key central autonomic regions involved in the regulation of blood pressure.  Under resting or basal conditions, the studies demonstrate notable differences in the expression of NO synthesising enzymes between normotensive and hypertensive animals, and correlating changes in the downstream signalling molecule cGMP.  In the spinal cord, novel functional differences in cGMP activity were also demonstrated.  In the RVLM, although differences in nNOS were demonstrated, cGMP expression could not be readily detected in either the WKY or SHR, while in contrast within the PVN, cGMP was detected in both magnocellular and parvocellular neuronal populations.
 
 Conclusion
 This thesis gives insight into the physiological role of NO and cGMP as mediators of central blood pressure control.  The results presented indicate that the NO-cGMP dependent signalling pathway may not be the dominant driver responsible for maintaining high blood pressure in the SHR model of essential hypertension, and that there is no globally consistent pattern of expression, and indeed the role of NO as a mediator of pressor and depressor function may vary between the autonomic regions examined.  Further, it is possible that this pathway is only recruited during activation of reflex homeostatic pathways or during times of marked physiological stress, and that the differences we see in basal expression between the normotensive and SHR animals are instead a result of compensatory mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/483/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Trade Practices Act (Cth) 1974 and its impact on maritime law in Australia</field><field name="creator">Lewins, Kate</field><field name="description">The trade of shipping is necessarily international in nature. Courts and international bodies often express the need to ensure international consistency in matters of maritime law. However, it has been an extremely difficult goal to achieve. Many countries have refused to be party to international conventions that seek to ensure comity. Some have enacted laws that reflect part but not all of those conventions, or seek to improve the protection offered by the conventions. The domestic law of each country also adds its own flavour to shipping law as recognised and applied by the courts in that jurisdiction. 
 
 In 1974 Australia enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (TPA), heralding a new era in corporate and commercial law. However, its impact on maritime law on Australia has only been felt over the last 10 - 15 years. It is potentially relevant to many areas of maritime law, including carriage of goods by sea, cruise ships, and towage. This thesis explores the encroachment of the TPA on a number of different areas of shipping law, using the few case examples on offer and extrapolating the impact that the TPA may have. It also considers the extent to which the TPA is stymied by simple contractual agreements to litigate or arbitrate in a non Australian forum, despite the TPA's status as a mandatory statute within Australia. 
 
 Raised at various points in the thesis is the possibility of law reform, which is a complex compendium of issues overlaid with a moral dimension - does shipping, as an industry, deserve to be exempted from the operation of the Act which sets a high standard of corporate behaviour? If so, how could that reform be shaped? In the meantime, what steps can the shipping industry take to work within the legal framework of the TPA?</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/484/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affordances and constraints on informal learning in the workplace: a sociocultural perspective</field><field name="creator">Le Clus, Megan</field><field name="description">In the last few decades, the workplace has been increasingly recognised as a legitimate environment for learning new skills and knowledge, which in turn enables workers to participate more effectively in ever-changing work environments.  Within the workplace there is the potential for continuous learning to occur not only through formal learning initiatives that are associated with training, but also through informal learning opportunities that are embedded within everyday work activities.  Somewhat surprisingly however, there have been relatively limited empirical investigations into the actual processes of informal learning in the workplace.  This may in part be due to the particular methodological challenges of examining forms of learning that are not structured or organised but incidental to daily work activities.  There remains, therefore, a clear need to better understand how learning occurs informally in the workplace, and most importantly, to gain insight into workers' own accounts of informal learning experiences.  This thesis addresses this issue by examining workers' personal experiences of informal learning, and how these contributed to better participation in their regular workplace activities. 
 
 Four bodies of literature were reviewed as directly relevant to this research, adult learning, organisational learning, informal learning, and a sociocultural perspective on learning.  Together, they provide complementary perspectives on the development of learning in the workplace.  A conceptual framework, grounded in the sociocultural perspective, was developed to address the issue of how informal learning leads to better participation in the workplace, and reciprocally, how better participation leads to continuous informal learning.  Consistent with the sociocultural perspective, the workplace was conceptualised as a complex social system in which co-workers, who constitute that social system, are assumed to co-regulate each other's learning opportunities.  Social interactions, therefore, are considered as creating a context in which informal learning is afforded or constrained.  Understanding what role workplace culture and socialisation play in affording or constraining informal learning opportunities is therefore crucial.  This is because the relationships between co-workers is assumed to influence how both new and established co-workers participate in and experience the socialisation process and how they see their respective roles.  The framework developed for the study generated two main research questions: How do co-workers learn informally in the workplace? and How does the workplace, as a social system, afford or constrain informal learning in the workplace?   
 
 The methodology chosen for this empirical study was consistent with key concepts from the sociocultural perspective, namely that individuals and their social context must be studied concurrently as learning is assumed to be part of a social practice where activities are structured by social, cultural and situational factors.  Accordingly, qualitative research methods were employed to gain knowledge and understanding of informal learning in the workplace from the perspective of co-workers.  Co-worker's reflections on their informal learning experiences and participation in the workplace are presented in narrative form and their accounts interpreted from the sociocultural theoretical perspective.  The narrative format provides a useful way of presenting data in a way that immerses the reader in the phenomenon, with enough concrete details that the reader can identify with the subjective experiences of informal learning of each participant.   
 
 The study highlighted how the nature of some relationships between new and established co-workers afforded opportunities for informal learning, while other relationships constrained such opportunities.  These afforded or constrained opportunities were by nature spontaneous, planned, intentional or unintentional.  The study also revealed that personal and organisational factors co-contributed to creating these social affordances or constraints. Common across groups was the importance given to the quality of relationships between co-workers. The way new and established co-workers participated and interacted in the workplace was found to represent important sociocultural processes that impacted on the effectiveness of informal learning. 
 
 Overall, this study draws attention to the complexity of participation and interaction in the workplace.  A major implication is that opportunities for informal learning are, potentially afforded or constrained by the social context.  The study also highlighted conceptual and methodological issues in identifying and interpreting how co-workers learn informally in the workplace.  Future research should establish how opportunities for effective informal learning might be fostered further through the design of more enabling workplace practices. The significance of perceived and expected roles between new and established co-workers also deserves further empirical attention, at the level of everyday informal practices but also at the level of organisational processes and structures that provide the broader context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/485/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of surfactant production by fetal type II pneumocytes and the characterization of fibroblast-pneumocyte factor</field><field name="creator">Maker, Garth Lucas</field><field name="description">The fetal lung undergoes extensive physiological and biochemical maturation prior to birth in preparation for its postnatal function as an organ for gas exchange. Pulmonary surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse, is produced by type II pneumocytes within the lung. Reduced ability to produce surfactant leads to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Synthesis of the phospholipid component of surfactant, phosphatidylcholine (PC), is stimulated by fibroblast-pneumocyte factor (FPF), a protein expressed by fibroblast cells within the fetal lung. Although its function is well known, the identity of this important protein has remained a mystery. Recent research has suggested that FPF may be neuregulin-1, a growth factor found in many tissues during development. 
 
 Enhanced synthesis of PC (and therefore detection of FPF) is measured using a tissue culture-based method. Primary cultures of lung fibroblasts and type II pneumocytes are prepared, and fibroblast-conditioned medium (FCM) is exposed to the type II cells. Resultant PC synthesis is measured using radioisotope-labeled PC-precursor and a chloroform-based lipid extraction method. Initial results using this method were very inconsistent, so a study was undertaken to determine which parts of the method could be contributing to this inconsistency. Cell density of type II cultures (measured in mcg DNA.plate-1) was shown to have a significant effect on results. Treatment of fibroblasts with 100 nM dexamethasone and exposure of type II cultures to the resultant FCM caused a mean 9.17% increase in PC synthesis, but when only type II cultures with a cell density below 25 mcg DNA.plate-1 were analyzed, this value increased to 17.56%. Type II cultures with cell density above this threshold value showed a mean increase in synthesis of only 3.39%. The consistent application of [3H]-choline chloride also had a significant effect on results. Experiments utilizing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to stimulate fibroblasts were very inconsistent. The mean activity of the initial [3H]-choline chloride solution prepared for these experiments was found to be 2.04 mcg Ci.mL-1, compared to a mean of 4.79 mcgCi.mL-1 for all other experiments. Observations from this section of the study led to considerable revision of the method used to measure PC synthesis. 
 
 Quadrupolar ion trap mass spectrometry (MS) was used to analyze FCM and determine if neuregulin-1 (NRG1) could be FPF. A mass spectrum was obtained for recombinant NRG1, with predominant ions of 1068, 1142 and 1246 m/z. All three of these ions were also detected in both control and dexamethasone-treated FCM. Partial fragmentation of 1068 m/z of NRG1 was achieved using MS2, and generated a base peak of 1047 m/z. This fragmentation was also observed in 1068 m/z from FCM. LC/MS was utilized to quantify NRG1 in FCM, using a standard curve generated using recombinant NRG1. Control FCM had a NRG1 concentration of 19.85 mcg.mL-1, while the concentration in dexamethasone treated FCM was 41.59 mcg.mL-1. FCM which had given no positive response to dexamethasone when tested using the indirect cultured cell system had a control NRG1 concentration of 20.85 mcg.mL-1, and a dexamethasone treated concentration of 22.84 mcg.mL-1. These values were not significantly different from the control value for FCM in those fibroblast cultures that had generated a positive response to dexamethasone. Results of this section of the study have provided strong evidence that NRG1 is a major component of FPF, and a review of the NRG1 signaling pathway further supports this conclusion. 
 
 Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are functionally related to neuregulins and are known to be important in fetal development. The effect of IGF-II on synthesis of surfactant PC and its subsequent secretion from type II pneumocytes was studied. In terms of PC synthesis, IGF-II was tested at concentrations of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mcM. The mean increase in synthesis was found to be 6.00, 6.15 and 6.91%, respectively. These values were not significantly different from control values. Secretion of PC was tested over the concentration range of 0.1 to 1.6 mcgM, with no significant effect observed. Possible inhibition by IGF-II was also studied, using the known stimulants of secretion, neuromedin C and isoproterenol. No significant effect on the enhanced level of secretion was observed when IGF-II was added with either secretagogue. Lack of an appropriate receptor and/or the possibility that cultured cells may not exactly mimic the situation in vivo are probably the reasons IGF-II has no effect on either synthesis or secretion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/486/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic dissection of disease resistance to Phoma medicaginis in Medicago truncatula</field><field name="creator">Kamphuis, Lars Gian</field><field name="description">Phoma medicaginis is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, commonly found infecting Medicago truncatula and M. sativa in temperate regions of Australia. To identify, characterize and differentiate eight P. medicaginis isolates from Western Australia, morphological phenotypes and five gene regions (actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor 1-alpha) were examined. Sequence comparisons showed that specimens isolated from M. truncatula in Western Australia formed a group that was consistently different from, but closely allied to, a P. medicaginis var. medicaginis type specimen. 
 
 Characterization of three P. medicaginis genotypes showed that all exhibited a narrow host range, causing disease only in M. sativa and M. truncatula among eight commonly cultivated legume species sampled. Infection of 85 M. truncatula accessions showed a continuous distribution in disease phenotypes, with the majority of accessions susceptible. Differences in disease phenotypes suggest that M. truncatula harbours specific and diverse sources of resistance to individual P. medicaginis genotypes. 
 
 To characterize the genetic basis of resistance to P. medicaginis two F2 populations derived from crosses between the resistant accession SA27063 and the susceptible accessions SA3054 and A17 were phenotyped for disease symptoms. Highly significant recessive QTLs for resistance to P. medicaginis OMT5 were identified in each mapping population. In SA27063 x A17 a QTL named resistance to the necrotroph Phoma medicaginis one (rnpm1) was identified on the short arm of LG4. In SA27063 x SA3054 a QTL (rnpm2) was identified on the long arm of LG8. Further fine mapping of the areas surrounding the QTLs is underway to identify the genes underlying rnpm1 and rnpm2. 
 
 Examination of the recombination frequencies between genetic markers on the long arms of chromosomes 4 and 8 in the SA27063 x A17 cross revealed an apparent genetic linkage between these chromosomes. Subsequent analysis of other crosses showed this unexpected linkage relationship is characteristic for genetic maps derived from A17. Furthermore F1 individuals derived from crosses involving A17 showed 50% pollen viability or less. This semisterility and the unexpected linkage relationships provide good evidence for a reciprocal translocation in A17 between chromosomes four and eight. The implications of the distinctive chromosomal rearrangement in A17 on genetic mapping, genome sequencing and comparative mapping are discussed. 
 
 The Mt16kOLI1plus microarray was used to identify transcriptional changes in M. truncatula expressed in defence against P. medicaginis. Three-hundred-and-thirty-four differentially expressed transcripts showed a change of two-fold or more in either the resistant or susceptible interaction, and most of the Phoma-regulated genes could be assigned to functional categories which have been reported to be involved in plant defence responses. RT-qPCR and HPLCUV confirmed involvement of the octadecanoid and phenylpropanoid pathways in response to P. medicaginis infection. Faster induction of lipoxygenase genes and constitutively higher levels of certain phenolic metabolites were observed in resistant plants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/487/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian porcine circoviruses</field><field name="creator">Muhling, Jill</field><field name="description">Two types of porcine circovirus (PCV) exist, referred to as PCV1 and PCV2.  PCV2 has been associated with disease syndromes in pigs, including that designated postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which has been identified in all regions of the world bar Australia (Hamel et al., 1998; Allan et al., 1999a; Onuki et al., 1999;  Martelli et al., 2000; Kyriakis et al., 2000; Wellenberg et al., 2000; Done et al., 2001; Trujano et al., 2001; Saradell et al., 2004; Castro et al., 2004; Jemersic et al., 2004; Maldonado et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004; Motovski and Segales, 2004; Garkavenko et al., 2005).  PMWS affects young weaner pigs and results in weight loss, tachypnea, dyspnea, enlarged lymph nodes and jaundice (Harding, 1998).  PCV2 may also cause or contribute to other swine diseases such as congential tremors (CT) (Stevenson et al., 1999), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) (Rosell et al., 2000), reproductive failure (Meehan et al., 2001) and several other emerging disease syndromes.  PCV1 is currently considered to be non-pathogenic. Although PMWS has not been reported in Australia, information on the distribution, variation and further characterisation of PCV in Australian pigs was necessary as it might provide insights into why there is no PCV-associated disease in this country.  The results reported in this thesis involved the detection and further study of porcine circovirus in Australia. 
 
 This chapter provides an outline of this thesis and the work undertaken, while Chapter 2 is a review of the relevant literature with particular reference to circoviral diseases.  Chapter 3 describes the detection of both PCV1 and PCV2 in the Australian pig herd, using a multiplex PCR designed to differentiate between the two viral types. The association of Australian PCV with two disease outbreaks was also investigated.  Following the detection of both viruses, it was important to genetically compare Australian PCV with overseas strains known to cause disease, and this was achieved with a sequencing and phylogenetic study as described in Chapter 4.  Possible reasons for the genetic groupings and distribution of different PCV2 strains worldwide are also discussed in this chapter. 
 
 As PMWS is as yet unidentified in Australian pigs, the importation of pig meat into Australia from countries with the disease requires careful monitoring.  Current protocols for the cooking of imported pig meat were designed to inactivate porcine reproductive and respiratory disease virus (PRRSV), and as such may not be effective against PCV.  In this study (Chapter 5), Australian PCV2 was successfully infected into cell culture, and detected using a variety of techniques. Subsequently, thermal stability experiments were performed using a newly-developed immunoperoxidase (IPMA) test.  It was anticipated that this study would determine whether current importation protocols require revision, and the results would suggest that this is the case, with PCV2 unaffected by treatment comparable with current cooking protocols. 
 
 While no animal experiments were undertaken in this study, it may become necessary to infect pigs with Australian PCV to determine viral pathogenicity.  Cell culture inoculums have been used in the past overseas, but problems with contamination and viral titre have been encountered (Fenaux et al., 2001).  Viral infectious clones can be used to overcome these problems, so an infectious clone of Australian PCV2 was constructed, as described in Chapter 6.  While time constraints prevented the clone from being infected into culture, it is anticipated that the construct would be infectious as it is based on a previously published method (Hattermann et al., 2004). Chapter 7 is a general discussion of the results and conclusions from this study. 
 
 The detection and characterisation of Australian PCV as described in this study has provided further information on the status of PCV in the Australian pig herd, and also developed diagnostic tests to assist in future research.  These tools will be important when assessing and managing the risk of Australia experiencing PCV-associated diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/488/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors leading to offshore manufacture of Australian inventions: the case of the orbital combustion process engine</field><field name="creator">Manley, Karen Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the factors which lead to off-shore manufacture of Australian inventions. It establishes this phenomenon as a problem, both in terms of its incidence in the post-war period, and in the strategic importance of innovative activity to economic growth. The thesis utilises a case study approach and concentrates on the experiences of one company, the Orbital Engine Corporation (Orbital). In 1989 Ralph Sarich, inventor of the Orbital Combustion Process (OCP) engine and founder of Orbital, signed an agreement with the Michigan state government to manufacture the engine in the United States of America (USA), in preference to several alternative sites in Australia and overseas. This occurred in the context of Orbital actively pursuing assistance from the Australian government to secure local production. The research question is: Why did Orbital decide to manufacture its engine invention ofshore? A multi-disciplinary approach to this question is adopted. Three different conceptual frameworks are employed: industrial organisation theory, market failure theory and policy network theory. The analysis is not structured around a pre-existing hypothesis; instead, the aim is to generate potential explanations for more rigorous testing by subsequent researchers. 
 
 The thesis concludes that, in terms of industrial organisation theory, the decision to manufacture OCP engines off-shore was a function of the poor quality of the Australian industrial context and the failure by those seeking assistance from the Commonwealth government to stress Orbital's status as an exemplary enterprise in Australian industry. Market failure theory indicated that offshore production of the OCP engine was made more likely by the suboptimal operation of the price mechanism, the neglect of market failure arguments by those supporting local production of the engine and 'government failure'. Policy network theory explained Orbital's decision as the result of: ineffective employment of negotiation tactics by proponents of the engine's domestic manufacture; and the chaotic nature of negotiations which allowed certain personal and ideological prejudices to dominate the issue resolution process. 
 
 It is shown that some or all of these explanations underlie a number of other examples where Australian inventions have been manufactured offshore. In commenting on policy implications, the thesis points to the economic potential of the Orbital invention and the value of interventionist industry policy. The thesis identifies a number of actions which might be taken to lower the incidence of foreign manufacture of Australian inventions. Further research is necessary to determine the relative importance of the various factors which are identified as leading to offshore production. In addition, there remains a particularly crucial need to improve the social efficiency of existing cost-benefit techniques employed by government policy-makers and commercial analysts.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/489/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mating system and reproduction in the honey possum, Tarsipes rostratus: a life-history and genetical perspective</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Kate Alexandra</field><field name="description">The honey possum Tarsipes rostratus, a marsupial endemic to South-Western Australia, feeds exclusively upon nectar and pollen. It is one of the smallest marsupials, with adult females (8-12g) significantly larger than adult males (6-9g). Honey possum males have the longest sperm (356 mcg) recorded for any mammaland the testes represent 4.2% body weight, amongst the largest recorded formammal species. These features suggest that sperm competition is an importantpart of the mating system. This study used a combination of field based studies,DNA analysis and histological examination of the female reproductive tract toinvestigate the life history, multiple paternity and reproduction of the honey possum innatural populations in the Fitzgerald River National Park (FRNP), on the south coastof Western Australia.
 
 This study drew upon earlier work on the honey possum in the FRNP in order to describe its life-history. The honey possum is short-lived (1-2 years), and attains sexual maturity whilst still growing. All four teats are occupied after birth, but the litter is reduced to 2 or 3 young during pouch life. The young have a relatively slow rate of growth. Breeding occurs continuously throughout the year, but is affected by the flowering phenologies of its foodplants. The greatest proportion of females with pouch-young occurs in winter; there are fewest pouch-young in autumn, a time of year when there is a dearth of flowers. Honey possums are essentially solitary animals, with no structured social unit, and male and female home ranges overlap. In captivity they are largely tolerant of one another, but larger females are behaviorally dominant to smaller females and to males.
 
 The densities and structure of the honey possum populations in the FRNP were analyzed from trapping data collected over 19 years. Population densities fluctuated significantly from season to season throughout the year, with changes in the flowering food resources available. There were also year-to-year differences in the intensity of those fluctuations, and these were significantly associated with rainfall in the previous year, and probably mediated through a lag effect in the flowering of the honey possum's foodplants. The greatest densities of animals occurred over winter. In years following high rainfall, mean winter densities reached 88 individuals per hectare. The lowest densities occurred in spring, and in years following low rainfall mean spring densities fell to 8 individuals per hectare. Even at these lowest densities, there is still the potential for interaction between males and females. A succession from high to low, then back to high densities was seen during the three years of the present study (2000-2002) and this shadowed a similar succession of changes in rainfall.
 
 The proportion of females with pouch-young was significantly affected by the season, and by rainfall in the previous year. Years following low rainfall had a lower proportion of females in a condition to breed. The autumn dip in breeding that occurred in all years was exacerbated following dry years. Of those females that did breed in 2001, a time of low resources, there was no difference in the size of the litter compared to 2000 and 2002, times of higher resource availability. The sex-ratio of pouch young was at parity, but there was a slight bias towards males among both juveniles (56%) and adults (58%). This was probably due to the greater movements shown by males. Sex ratios were not affected by changes in rainfall and density. Male-biased dispersal was detected using genetic data and the movement patterns of males showed that they moved greater distances than females during their normal activity.
 
 Analysis of four microsatellite loci revealed extremely high levels of variation, with 28 to 50 alleles per locus and a mean expected heterozygosity of 0.95. These are amongst the highest seen in any microsatellite study of vertebrates. There was multiple paternity in 86% litters, using a minimum number of sires per litter method, and in 95% litters, using an estimated number of sires method based upon the relatedness of litter males. This indicates that multiple mating is frequent in female honey possums and is evidence for sperm competition. The estimated number of sires in a litter was often three or four. In 41% of cases, the number of sires was less than the number of young in the litter, indicating that some males were more successful at siring offspring than others. Nevertheless, no more than two offspring in a litter were known to have been sired by the same male. Despite marked fluctuations in density from high in 2000, to low in 2001, then high again in 2002, the level of multiple paternity remained equally high in all years.
 
 Embryonic diapause and female reproduction was investigated in the honey possum. All adult females examined, both with and without pouch-young, were either close to oestrus, had ovulated or were carrying conceptuses. The honey possum has a postpartum oestrus and it was evident that this occurs approximately 2-4 days after birth. Cleavage and formation of the unilaminar blastocyst appears to occur rapidly over approximately 5 days. Embryonic diapause proceeded in a two phase manner similar to other small possum species. The unilaminar blastocyst expanded rapidly at first; and then, from about 18-20 days after birth, the diameter of the blastocyst remained constant at approximately 1.2-1.8mm. No growth or development beyond the unilaminar stage was observed during pouch-life. The first signs of reactivation occurred during lactation, after pouch exit, and expansion of the blastocyst only occurred in one post-lactational female. The development of the corpus luteum appeared different to patterns described for other marsupials, but its formation coincided with the formation of the unilaminar blastocyst. The diameter of the corpus luteum remained constant throughout diapause. The histology of the reproductive tract was generally similar to other marsupials. There were no sperm storage crypts in the female reproductive tract.
 
 The length of pouch-life in the honey possum was 55-65 days, and the interval between litters of the same size varied between 65 and 100 days. Embryonic diapause may reduce the time between production of successive litters in the honey possum, but lifetime reproductive potential is reasonably low. Females had up to four litters over the period that they were captured. Thus, each litter represents a substantial proportion (25%) of a female's lifetime reproductive output. Reproductive amortization occurred, with 61% loss overall, due to overproduction of ova, loss of conceptuses and reduction of the litter during lactation.
 
 The behavioural dominance of females suggests that multiple mating is an active strategy, and this presumably allows the genetic quality of their offspring to be maximized. Males that succeed in sperm competition may be of better intrinsic quality. Overproduction of conceptuses by females presents the opportunity for them to select those fertilized by intrinsically viable males or genetically compatible males. Sexually active males are present all year round. Females were not synchronous in their sexual receptivity, and this would lead to a skewed operational sex ratio, with more reproductive males than oestrous females. Since adult males are significantly smaller than adult females and possess no ornaments or armaments, it is unlikely that males overtly fight for access to females. Rather, males appear to monitor the reproductive status of females through smell, and probably compete in their ability to locate oestrous females. The risk and intensity of sperm competition is high, sexual selection for a large investment in spermatogenesis is evident and competition after copulation is probably an important factor in the mating system. It is likely that males, as well as females mate multiply, and the mating system is promiscuous.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/490/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intensification of single stage continuously stirred tank anaerobic digestion process using carriers</field><field name="creator">Budiastuti, Herawati</field><field name="description">The Continuously fed Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is a popular design for anaerobic treatment of wastewater. This reactor type is simple in design and operation, independent of biomass type and low in capital costs. The CSTR has, however, to be operated at long Hydraulic Retention Times (HRT) of the order of 16 to 30 days since biomass is continuously lost with the effluent. Various alternate concepts of reactor design have, therefore, been developed to allow more rapid treatment. Treatment can be enhanced by retaining biomass within the digester so that the HRT is decoupled from solid biomass retention time (SRT). Unlike in continuous stirred tank digesters where the SRT is equal to HRT, the SRT in other designs are much greater than the HRT. This allows the wastewater to be treated at high throughputs while retaining the biocatalyst (or biomass) mediating the treatment within the digester. 
 
 In this study the operation of a CSTR was intensified by separating SRT from HRT while taking into account the economical aspects. The intensification of operation is defined as increasing wastewater throughput or organic loading rate while at the same time maintaining efficiency of treatment and robustness to reject disturbances (changes in wastewater concentration and flow rate). The operation of existing CSTR was intensified by addition of carriers. It is hypothesized that by providing surfaces (or carriers) for bacterial attachment within the continuous stirred tank digester, biomass will be better retained and the wastewater throughput can be increased. 
 
 The carriers or surfaces employed in this study were light carrier elements (shredded granular rubber tire having a density of 0.96 g/cm3) that move gently with the water in the reactor. This carrier material is much cheaper compared with other commercial carrier materials. This reactor type, called an Anaerobic Moving Bed Reactor (AMBR), was applied in this study to treat high strength synthetic wastewater, containing molasses as the main substrate. 
 
 The improvement of reactor performance was clearly shown by the capability of the system to be operated without any difficulties at HRT of 6 days at an OLR of 5.8 g COD/l/d or at HRT of 1 day at an OLR of 4 g COD/l/d. The carriers were shown to be effective in retaining biomass aggregates. 
 
 The AMBR was further intensified by changing the feeding strategy. It was shown that in stirred tank digester without carriers an intermittent feeding strategy resulted in better microbial capacity to degrade higher chain volatile fatty acids like propionic and butyric acids than the continuous feeding mode. An increase in degrading capacity of the intermittently fed digester was shown via degradation rates of pulse additions of propionic and butyric acids and by its capability of handling all changes in loading rates imposed. The continuously fed digester, receiving constant feed, on the other hand, suffered more when loading rates were changed, and the degradation rates of propionic and butyric acids were slower.
 
 The intermittent feeding mode was then implemented on the AMBR, and it was operated as a sequencing batch reactor with a fill, react, settle and decant period in each cycle. The sequencing batch mode when applied to the AMBR (now called an Anaerobic Moving Bed Sequencing Batch Reactor or AMBSBR) could increase capability of the digester to handle higher shock loads. At 3.8 d HRT the AMBSBR could handle an OLR of 10.8 g COD/l/d as opposed to 7.4 g COD/l/d by the AMBR. At 2.5 d HRT the AMBSBR could handle an OLR of 6.4 g COD/l/d while the AMBR could only be loaded at an OLR of 4.2 g COD/l/d. The ratio of SRT to HRT was at least 15 for this reactor. The reactor was able to handle concentrated feed flow rates at longer cycles or more dilute feed flow rates at frequent shorter cycles. 
 
 The proposed operational strategies were verified by using a structured mathematical model which was developed based on the IWA ADM1 model. Several modifications were implemented to the model to obtain better predictions. The modified model was capable in predicting all the trends of the operating variables from both continuously and intermittently fed reactors. None of the two model versions (ADM1 and modified models) was, however, able to predict the increased propionate degradation capacity in intermittently fed digesters. The reason for this was the assumption of fixed stoichiometry of fermentative reactions for glucose mineralisation. By modifying the fractions of glucose mineralisation a better fit between experimental results and the model could be obtained.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/491/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology, ecology and taxonomy of Phytophthora citricola in native plant communities in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Bunny, Felicity J.</field><field name="description">The objectives of the project were to develop an understanding of the disease dynamics caused by Phytophthora citricola in native plant communities in the south of Western Australia. Prior to 1983, the pathogen had only been reported twice from Australian forests. Since then, P. citricola has been extensively recorded from plant communities north and south of Perth, and is currently the second most frequently recovered Phytophthora species from the northern jarrah forest and the northern sandplains.
 
 The objectives were addressed by examining the biology, ecology and taxonomy of isolates of P. citricola local to the southwest. Examination of the intraspecific variation of P. citricola by isozyme analysis resolved three major electrophoretic subgroups (SG), and these were aligned with morphological and cultural variation within the species. One electrophoretic SG was confined to forested areas. This SG differed from other SGs in sporangial dimensions, growth rate on two media and in vitro sensitivity to phosphonate. A redescription of the species may be warranted.
 
 P. citricola was positively associated with two roads in the northern jarrah forest. Road surfaces were sampled, then soil overburden was removed and the surface of the concreted lateritic layer beneath was sampled. Isolation of P. citricola declined away from the road into the adjacent forest and was more frequently recovered from the caprock (up to 1 metre below soil surface) than from the soil surface. The most probable source of introduction was from infested soil on vehicles using the roads.
 
 Oospores were shown to be produced in two soils, a lateritic gravelly loam and sand, and in plants. In soil, the electrophoretic SG confined to the forest (loamy soil) produced only limited numbers of oospores in the sandy soil of the northern sandplain. The restriction of this SG to the forested areas is probably physiological, rather than limited dispersal, with the SG currently occupying the full extent of its range. Estimation of the relative persistence of oospores, zoospores and plant material colonised by P. citricola established that only oospores (either free in soil or in colonised plant material) were important in long tern survival in soil. Oospores were still viable after six months at two field sites, and after 18 months in soil in the laboratory. 
 
 Phosphonate is currently the most promising method of control of Phytophthora induced disease in native plant cornmunites of the southwest. The efficacy of phosphonate against P. citricola was examined in vivo and in vitro against two SGs. Phosphonate successfully inhibited lesion growth of both SGs in vivo, but of only one electrophoretic subgroup in vitro. The ecological implications of infestation of native plant communities in the southwest of Australia are discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/492/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interrogating the World Bank's policy on innovative delivery for higher education</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Madeline Jane</field><field name="description">Over the past thirty years, the World Bank has intensified its activities relating to education in developing countries. Notable developments in the World Bank's policy on education include promotion of 'innovative delivery', which refers to the use of new and existing Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in education. The World Bank claims that the unique characteristics of ICTs have the potential to produce new forms of delivery in higher education that can overcome existing barriers to education and facilitate student-centred learning (World Bank, 1999, 2005).
 
 Many forms of innovative delivery, such as distance education and open learning, are not new forms of instruction. However, promotion of innovative delivery as a global priority for education in developing countries is new. In this thesis, I interrogate the World Bank's assumptions concerning innovative delivery as expressed in their landmark policy statement on education, the 1999 Education Sector Strategy Report (ES99) (World Bank, 1999). I focus on the assumptions that underlie views put forward in the ES99 on the nature of technology and its role in education, the role of innovative delivery in overcoming existing barriers to education, and the potential of innovative delivery to facilitate student-centred learning. A central aim of this thesis was to better understand the socio-cultural and pedagogical issues that may arise when these assumptions are put into practice in different cultural contexts. This was achieved by comparing the assumptions put forward in the ES99 with the reported  perceptions of, attitudes toward, and use of ICTs by students and lecturers from three different cultural contexts.
 
 Qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to gather detailed empirical data on end-users' perceptions, attitudes to and use of online technologies at universities in Australia, Malaysia and the United States. The findings suggested that across all three cultural contexts, respondents' attitudes were not consistent with the World Bank's technocratic view of innovative delivery. Moreover, the findings cast doubt on the extent to which technology-mediated education can overcome existing barriers to education and facilitate a student-centred approach to education. I conclude by suggesting that the World Bank needs to adopt a more questioning stance toward the potential effectiveness of innovative delivery. Other findings point to the contextual nature of technology adoption and the pedagogical implications of this mode of delivery across cultural contexts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/493/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating transactional space for sustainability: a case study of the Western Australian Collaboration</field><field name="creator">Buselich, Kathryn</field><field name="description">Progressing sustainability requires a more networked approach to governance?an approach that connects otherwise segmented policy areas and fosters greater communication among governments, stakeholders and citizens.  Of particular importance is the development of discursive spaces in which diverse actors are able to explore the differing knowledge, perspectives and values raised by the challenge of sustainability.  This thesis develops the notion of transactional space to bring into focus the processes of reflection, dialogue and mutual learning that effective sustainability discourse involves.  In the first part of the thesis I review literature on the theory and practice of participation, deliberation and collaboration, giving particular attention to the ways in which these processes have potential to create space for a depth of exchange and enable participants to engage with the tensions inherent in complex policy issues.  While many authors point to the importance of negotiating difference in these processes, the literature reveals that, in practice, this type of exchange tends to be overlooked or underdeveloped.  I therefore argue in this thesis that critical, reflective dialogue plays a key role in generating greater understanding among participants, more comprehensive understanding of policy issues, and more integrative and shared approaches, and for these reasons must be actively developed.  
 
 The case study in the second part of the thesis explores this concern for developing reflective exchange in practice.  The formation of the Western Australian Collaboration in 2002 - a partnership of non-government organizations from a range of social and environmental perspectives committed to 'a just and sustainable Western Australia'- represented an opportunity to examine the development of participatory and collaborative processes for sustainability.  The thesis presents a case study of the WA Collaboration's development over 2002-2006 to illustrate the potential such networks and open forums offer for transformative exchange around sustainability.  It describes the intensive process conducted with the Steering Committee to cultivate a culture of reflection and learning in the organization, and the practical initiatives the process helped to generate.
 
 The thesis concludes with a discussion of the lessons learnt and key principles and practical considerations relevant to fostering transactional space.  The WA Collaboration experience and the review of literature reveal a tendency in practice to privilege action and outcomes over reflection and learning.  Furthermore, despite the necessity for a depth of engagement with complex policy issues, funding systems and policy environments often fail to allow the time and resources needed to support genuine dialogue and collaborative work.  The thesis provides the concept and principles of transactional space as a means of helping to address this imbalance.  They are designed to encourage practitioners to create opportunities for critical, reflective dialogue in a range of deliberative settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/494/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shift work: an occupational health and safety hazard</field><field name="creator">Buxton, Sandra Michelle</field><field name="description">Shift work is a major feature of modern work practices. It involves individuals working at times considered unconventional for most workers, such as at night. Although the community often benefits from such work practices, shift work can be hazardous, for both the workers and the community. 
 
 The thesis reviews the main problems of shift work, especially when involving night work. These are: an increased risk for accidents and errors; increased sleepiness and fatigue due to difficulties sleeping; increased health problems; and disruption to family and social life. Strategies to limit the risk associated with these hazards are also reviewed, and include using knowledge of circadian principles to plan shift schedules, sleeping schedules and meal times; planned napping; consideration of the work environment; and newer techniques such as using bright lights and melatonin. 
 
 While this information is known to the research community, it has not filtered down to many shift work workplaces and thus has had little if any positive effect on actual shift work practices. For a change in shift work practices to occur, the research knowledge must become available to every shift work workplace, as must some incentive or motivation to ensure that workplaces make the necessary changes. 
 
 The Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) laws provide such a framework. Considering shift work as an OHS hazard would ensure that all shift work workplaces identified the hazards of shift work, conducted a risk assessment to identify the risk associated with the hazards, and then implemented the appropriate strategies, from the hierarchy of shift work hazard control measures, for both employers and employees, to fulfil their duty of care to minimise the risks. Considering shift work as an OHS issue would ensure that the research information was used as intended - to improve the safety, performance, and quality of life of all shift workers. The present thesis reviews the shift work research and introduces an OHS perspective as a method to manage shift work effectively.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/495/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jolly good nutter: a discursive psychological examination of bipolar disorder in psychotherapeutic interactions</field><field name="creator">Bysouth, Don</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines how bipolar disorder, a common and disabling psychiatric condition, is made relevant as a participants' concern in a site of massively consequential psychological business - the psychotherapy session. As its central thesis is the claim that the practices by which bipolar disorder gets done as bipolar disorder are invariably absent in most formal accounts of the disorder. In this regard, the dissertation provides an empirically grounded description of a range of discursive practices associated with the doing of bipolar disorder in psychotherapy. This is undertaken from a discursive psychological orientation that draws extensively from ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and Wittgensteinian philosophy.
 
 Following a review of bipolar disorder as a diagnostic psychiatric category, consideration is given to alternate conceptualisations which suggest the category is constructed in-and-through complex socio-historical practices which are often occluded and considered irrelevant to the category's situated deployment. This notion is used to provide a more sustained examination of how one might 'get at' such practices in situ by way of conducting ethnomethodological and conversation analytically informed investigations. In consideration of how one might approach psychological categorisation practices in talk-in-interaction, a discursive psychological orientation is developed which stresses the social, public nature of psychological categories in use.
 
 The empirical materials examined in the dissertation are drawn from a corpus of audio recordings of seven 'naturally occurring' psychotherapy sessions involving a clinical psychologist and five clients for whom the category 'bipolar disorder' has demonstrable relevance. Practices examined include those relating to the production and recognition of what might count as a bipolar disorder 'symptom', the manner in which 'moods' operate as account production devices, and the methods by which psychological terms (such as 'thought' and 'feel') operate in-and-as situated practices involved in psychotherapeutic business.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/496/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of glyceryl trinitrate and ovariectomy on femoro-tibial articular cartilage, synovium and subchondral bone in normal and osteoarthritic ewes</field><field name="creator">Cake, Martin</field><field name="description">Nitric oxide (NO) alters chondrocyte metabolism, and is thought to be a key catabolic mediator in osteoarthritis. NO is also an important modifier of bone metabolism, and may partially mediate the bone-sparing effects of oestrogen. Oestrogen has also been linked to the modulation of osteoarthritis, though its role is not clear. The aim of this study was to examine the structural and metabolic effects of ovariectomy and the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on (1) normal ovine femoro-tibial joint tissues, and (2) the progression of joint lesions in the established ovine meniscectomy model of osteoarthritis. 
 
 Preliminary investigations tested a novel computer-assisted histomorphometric method of assessing osteochondral changes post-meniscectomy, in a trial of a putative disease-modifying osteoarthritis compound. Quantitative assessment revealed a subtle protective effect not evident by qualitative methods. These techniques were then used to test the experimental hypotheses in a combined trial involving 48 aged ewes, variously subjected to ovariectomy, bilateral lateral meniscectomy, and/or topical GTN therapy. At six months, joint tissues were analysed using histology, histomorphometry, dynamic biomechanical testing, serum markers, bone densitometry, and tissue culture of synovial fibroblasts and explants of cartilage and bone. Ovariectomy modified cartilage structure and chondrocyte metabolism, and induced subchondral bone remodelling. Prior ovariectomy altered the development of OA lesions post-meniscectomy, producing thicker but biomechanically inferior cartilage and elevated metabolic activity in subchondral bone. GTN treatment of normal sheep induced thinner, structurally-altered cartilage in normal sheep, and accentuated cartilage and subchondral bone lesions post-meniscectomy. These results support an important homeostatic role for oestrogen in joint tissues, and show that GTN, a commonly used angina therapy, can induce structural alterations in joint tissues and potentially accelerate the progression of concurrent OA. Results also advance understanding of the role of synovial and subchondral bone changes in the pathogenesis of this OA model.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/497/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of third culture kids: the experiences of Australasian adults</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Rosalea</field><field name="description">The ecology of human development has been shown to be different for different cultures and sub-cultures within a particular culture, and to play a significant part in shaping the outcome traits or character profile exhibited by individuals who experience a given ecology. This is the case for members of that sub-culture of children who spend childhood years abroad; who expect to eventually repatriate to their passport country.
 
 Those who experience the phenomenon have been called Third Culture Kids or TCKs, and the outcome profile for those with a North American background has been identified. However, no literature on children in the Australasian context exists. A progressive naturalistic study, using both qualitative and quantitative methodology, was undertaken providing foundational data on the experience of adult Australasians (Australians and New Zealanders) who had experienced such a childhood ecology. The Australasian self-reported reflections were compared with descriptions of the North American and international experience presented in existing literature. Further, accepted models of human development were merged and adapted to produce a TCK-specific model of human development. This model was a significant product of this research project. 
 
 Components of particular importance to development that nurtured the outcome profile traits were identified and represented in the model. The study incorporated three phases: phase 1 involved the in-depth interview of 3 respondents who had experienced the TCK ecology on three different continents, phase 2 involved data collection on the demographics of the broader Australasian TCK population asking questions about family choices, education, and career trajectories (N=50), and phase 3 collected in-depth descriptions of the childhood TCK ecology through voluntary response to an extensive written survey and asked for comparison with the imagined alternative ecology had respondents remained in their passport country (N=45). In both phases 1 and 3 respondents were asked to describe character traits they believed they manifested as a direct result of immersion in the TCK ecology and then suggest traits they might otherwise have manifested had the imagined alternative ecology been the nurturing environment. Tabulation of the emerging data allowed comparison and contrast with the North American outcome profile traits that have been described in literature. In both tabulations many outcome profile traits were identified as being in polar contrast with each other; the TCK could manifest either or both of the apparently opposing traits.
 
 Manifestation was dependent upon the immediate context within which the TCK was functioning. There was shown to be a significant overlap in the outcome profile for Australasians and North Americans. However, in this study Australasians presented stronger in their self-report of altered relational patterns and traits related to resourcefulness and practical abilities than was described in the North American literature. In comparing outcome profile traits of the real TCK ecology and those that were associated with the imagined alternative ecology respondents reported that they would have been more confident and more socially competent, but less tolerant and less globally aware had they been raised in the passport country. The self-reported outcome traits or profile were linked to the developmental ecology by exploring the processes and tensions that were at work. It was shown that dynamic tensions emerged and increased in valence as the individual gradually developed polarised traits that manifested according to engagement in the multiple contexts the TCK was required to manage. The results of this study have implications for those who deploy families abroad, as well as those who educate, and nurture the social potential of TCKs. This study has served to extend understanding of the phenomenon at the international level and laid a foundation for specific understanding of the Australasian context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/498/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding, modelling and predicting transport mobility in urban environments</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Iain</field><field name="description">In the last three decades the global population has been growing at an essentially constant rate, at around 1.5 per cent per year, to about 6.026 billion in 2000 when it was estimated that 47% of that population live in an urban environment. Further, a United Nations' projection indicates that 60% of the total global population may be living in an urban settlement by the year 2025. This increasing urbanisation brings with it increased employment, that delivers affluence, which then continues the cycle of migration and movement to these growing metropolitan areas in both developed and developing countries.
 
 As cities increase in population and expand their urban area, there is a consequential expansion of urban transportation and accompanying service infrastructure. People travel daily, irrespective of their vast differences in culture, economic conditions and means of transportation. This daily mobility is sought for its own sake as well as to bridge the spatial distance that separates their homes from the work place, to accomplish their household's domestic needs and to undertake social journeys, such as visiting friends and taking holidays.
 
 As the world's urban population undertakes its daily mobility by a variety of transportation modes, an individual's mobility behaviour and mode-choice is governed by a complex matrix of physical and human, social and management indicators, measures and/or drivers. A literature review describes the current understanding of this complex matrix and concludes by identifying and defining a set of fundamental underlying measures that drive private motorised, public transport and non-motorised (walking and bicycling) mobility at national, city and household levels.
 
 As practical instruments, transportation models play an important role in providing decision-makers with analytical tools to help them understand their city's transportation and the different future scenarios it may face. While not necessarily producing foolproof information or predictions, models are still the best methods available to test the likely implications of alternative transportation policy decisions in a rapidly changing urban environment. Urban transport models are generally based on the notion that traffic can be modelled in aggregate measures through statistical data and predictive modelling techniques.
 
 In this research, dimensional analysis is used to derive sketch-plan models for private motorised, public transport and non-motorised mobility for any urban environment based on four-decades of detailed land-use and travel pattern data from a large international sample of cities. These models are developed on the basis of a set of fundamental underlying measures that are deemed to drive private motorised, public transport and non-motorised (walking and bicycling) mobility at the city level.
 
 Importantly, the models also embody three key attributes. They are:
 * easy to use, minimising user requirements and data inputs
 * policy-sensitive, capable of assessing a sufficient range of policy options
 * reliable and robust over time, so that the results can be consistently believed.
 The capacity of the sketch-plan models to predict personal mobility in an urban environment is statistically validated against an independent land-use and travel pattern data set for 83 cities located on five continents. Despite their simplicity and maintaining a consistent functional form over a time-series of four-decades and across all geographic and cultural regions, the private motorised mobility model can consistently explain up to 92% of the variance in private motorised urban mobility. The results for the public transport mobility model are less reliable and consistent, in particular when developing cities are part of the model. Results for developed or wealthier cities are much better. Reasons for these results and their inadequacies are discussed. The non-motorised modes mobility model is the least successful part of the modelling work. This can be attributed to a combination of inadequate data and, very likely, the more micro-level determinants of usage of these modes.
 
 The private motorised urban mobility sketch-plan model equation developed in this thesis is able to predict present and future trends of automobile use in individual cities to a high degree of statistical reliability. The model equation offers urban transport planners a focused direction on the fundamental measures that have the potential to control and deliver automobile restraint policies and strategies. A series of case studies shows that this model has wide applications in understanding past trends in private motorised mobility and in developing urban environmental strategy and policy through its ability to calculate and assess current and future motor vehicle emissions inventories in cities. The thesis makes suggestions for future work in this area of metropolitan level transport modelling, in particular, how to improve the public and non-motorised transport models so that total urban transport mobility can be better understood and modelled.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/499/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping fire affected areas in northern Western Australia - towards an automatic approach</field><field name="creator">Candy, Katherine</field><field name="description">Wildfires across northern Australia are a growing problem with more than 2.5 million hectares being burnt each year. Accordingly, remote sensing has been used as a tool to routinely monitor and map fire histories. In northern Western Australia, the Department of Land Information Satellite Remote Sensing Services (DLI SRSS) has been responsible for providing and interpreting NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data. SRSS staff utilise this data to automatically map hotspots on a daily basis, and manually map fire affected areas (FAA) every nine days. This information is then passed on to land managers to enhance their ability to manage the effects of fire and assess its impact over time.
 
 The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm for the near real-time automatic mapping of FAA in the Kimberley and Pilbara as an alternative to the currently used semimanual approach. Daily measures of temperature, surface reflectance and vegetation indices from twenty nine NOAA-16 (2001) passes were investigated. It was firstly necessary to apply atmospheric and BRDF corrections to the raw reflectance data to account for the variation caused by changing viewing and illumination geometry over a cycle.
 
 Findings from the four case studies indicate that case studies 1 and 2 exhibited a typical fire response (visible and near-infrared channels and vegetation indices decreased), whereas 3 and 4 displayed an atypical response (visible channel increased while the near-infrared channel and vegetation indices decreased). Alternative vegetation indices such as GEMI, GEMI3 and VI3 outperformed NDVI in some cases. Likewise atmospheric and BRDF corrected NDVI provided better performance in separating burnt and unburnt classes.
 
 The difficulties in quantifying FAA due to temporal and spatial variation result from numerous factors including vegetation type, fire intensity, rate of ash and charcoal dispersal due to wind and rain, background soil influence and rate of revegetation. In this study two different spectral responses were recorded, indicating the need to set at least two sets of thresholds in an automated or semi-automated classification algorithm. It also highlighted the necessity of atmospheric and BRDF corrections.
 
 It is therefore recommended that future research apply atmospheric and BRDF corrections at the pre-processing stage prior to analysis when utilising a temporal series of NOAAAVHRR data. Secondly, it is necessary to investigate additional FAA within the four biogeographic regions to enable thresholds to be set in order to develop an algorithm. This algorithm must take into account the variation in a fire's spectral response which may result from fire intensity, vegetation type, background soil influence or climatic factors.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/500/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A detailed performance comparison of PV modules of different technologies and the implications for PV system design methods</field><field name="creator">Carr, Anna Judith</field><field name="description">In designing any power generation system that incorporates photovoltaics (PV) there is a basic requirement to accurately estimate the output from the proposed PV array under operating conditions. PV modules are given a power rating at standard test conditions(STC) of 1000Wm-2, AM1.5 and a module temperature of 25 degrees C, but these conditions do not represent what is typically experienced under outdoor operation.
 
 It is well known that different PV technologies have different seasonal patterns of behaviour. These differences are due to the variations in spectral response, the different temperature coefficients of voltage and current and, in the case of amorphous silicon (a-Si) modules, the extra effect of photo-degradation and thermal annealing.
 
 In this study a novel method has been used to obtain highly accurate energy output data

 The monitoring system allows the simultaneous measurement of six different modules under long-term outdoor operation, which in turn allows a direct comparison of the performance of the modules.
 
 Each of the modules has been deployed for at least one year, which provides useful information about the seasonal behaviour of each technology.
 
 This data set ultimately provides system designers and consumers with valuable information on the expected output of these different module types in climates like that of Perth, Western Australia.
 
 The second part of the study uses the output data collected to assess and compare output predictions made by some currently available photovoltaic performance prediction tools or methods. These range from a generalised approach, as used in the Australian Standards, to the commercially available software packages that employ radiation, thermal and PV models of varying complexities. The results of these evaluations provide very valuable information, to PV consumers, about how complex PV output prediction tools need to be to give acceptable results.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/501/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Government decision-making and environmental degradation: a study relating to mining activities in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Carr, Frank</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a country possessing abundant resources of gold, oil, copper, timber, and fish stocks. It is hampered in its development and management of these resources, however, by serious problems of governance and corruption. These problems are evident throughout the economy and also in the management of the environment. The level of environmental damage caused by the mining industry in PNG is now such that it will require extensive rehabilitation, if the areas affected can, indeed, ever be fully rehabilitated. The mining companies which precipitated this damage were licensed and encouraged by the PNG Government in the initiation and exercise of the mining operations. The resulting environmental impact has affected the lives of thousands of New Guineans to their detriment. The degradation caused remains
 unredressed.
 
 Compounding the problem, there is a growing reliance by Papua New Guinea on mineral exploitation for foreign direct investment, government revenues, and foreign exchange. Gold exports accounted for the biggest share of export revenues in 2002 representing 37.5% of the total. In light of this growing dependency on mining activities, there is a correspondingly urgent requirement to address the deficiencies in the administrative, monitoring, and policing aspects of the protection of its environment.
 
 Despite the public evidence of the damage to the environment and the ensuing affect on the people of Papua New Guinea by mining activities; and despite universal condemnation of these activities and the companies responsible; the companies continue to conduct these activities without official hindrance and with little apparent concern for the long-term ramifications of their actions.
 
 This thesis will examine the degradation resulting from the mining activities of companies in Papua New Guinea over the last three decades - particularly those of Placer Dome's Porgera gold mine, BHP's Ok Tedi gold and copper mine (the waste from both of which is dumped into the Ok Tedi and Strickland rivers which are tributaries of the Fly River and form part of the Fly River system) and Lihir Gold Limited's gold mine on Lihir Island. It will examine the extent to which the Government of Papua New Guinea may have wittingly (in the sense of a prescience as to the possible or probable likelihood of deleterious impact) or unwittingly contributed to that degradation as a result of its actions or omissions.
 
 Studies of available literature suggest that there has been little attention paid to the subject of culpability on the part of successive PNG governments in matters of environmental damage. This research will contribute to reducing this gap in the literature by focusing on possible motives of the PNG government and its actors which precipitated those decisions and which resulted in environmental degradation. The discussion will examine the likely motivation of the PNG government in its deliberations and decisions and the extent to which corruption and incompetence may have played a role.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/502/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine phytoplankton primary production and ecophysiology using chlorophyll-A fluorescence</field><field name="creator">Cosgrove, Jeffrey John</field><field name="description">Marine phytoplankton ecophysiological state and primary production measurements have typically been controversial due to potential impacts of measurement techniques. Advances in chl-a fluorescence techniques have provided a means for rapid, non-invasive measurement of electron transport through photosystem 2 (PSII) in dilute phytoplankton suspensions. While studies on higher plants have outlined a close relationship between PSII electron transport and carbon fixation, results from studies on microalgae reveal significant variations in the relationship.
 
 Three species of phytoplankton representing three major taxonomic groups of the marine phytoplankton were used in this study: (1) Chaetoceros muelleri CS176 Lemmermann (Bacillariophyta), (2) Isochrysis galbana CS177 Parke (Haptophyta) and, (3) Nannochloropsis oculata CS179 (Droop) Hibberd (Ochrophyta, eustigmatophyte). Each species was cultured in semicontinuous culture and primary production was estimated using oxygen evolution and carbon fixation techniques and compared against predictions based on chl-a fluorescence measurements. It was found that predicted values of primary production both under-estimated and overestimated actual carbon fixation measured via radioisotope (14C) techniques. This variation was primarily explained by probable errors in the assumed values for PSII density. The relationship between oxygen evolution or carbon fixation with chl-a fluorescence-derived measures was commonly linear below the light saturation parameter, with a departure from linearity occurring at higher irradiances. This departure from linearity was greatest in cultures adapted to low light conditions. At higher light intensities alternative electron pathways such as the Mehler reaction and/or chlororespiration are likely to be more active in low light-adapted cultures, leading to this greater non-linearity.
 
 Chl-a fluorescence measurements were also found to be a useful in characterising ecophysiology using photosynthesis-versus irradiance curves. However, an important caveat on this is the measurement of PSII density ([eta]PSII) rather than use of an assumed value as changes in [eta]PSII can have a profound impact on light curve parameters.
 
 A field study in Fremantle Harbour found a healthy (negligible nutrient starvation), diatom dominated, phytoplankton community. Results suggest that phytoplankton are able to begin boosting photosynthetic capability just prior to morning twilight. Waters in the harbour were well mixed via tidal motion and substantial midday photoinhibition was not observed. Data suggest levels of primary production at the mouth of the harbour are similar to those of coastal waters in the plume of the Ocean Reef wastewater outfall.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/503/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the fluency paradigm: the effects of accuracy training before rate-building and incremental increases in response rates on skill retention, endurance, stability, application and adduction</field><field name="creator">Coyle, Catherine</field><field name="description">Fluency has recently been operationalized in terms of the acquisition of performance rates that predict a number of learning outcomes, depicted in the acronym RESAA, which represents skill retention, endurance, stability, application and adduction (Johnson and Layng, 1996). The RESAA model has not yet been adequately researched under controlled, experimental conditions.
 
 A preliminary study (Study 1) compared two rate-building procedures, under experimental conditions, with five Year 2 children with a mean age of six years eight months and seven pre-primary children with a mean age of four years seven months. The effects of practice and reinforcement were controlled. Long-term follow-up RESAA measures were conducted three months after the completion of the intervention.
 
 The major study in this research project (Study 2) is an empirical investigation of the effects on RESAA measures of increasing the performance rates of a component skill in reading to specific, incremental rate aims with twelve Year 2 children aged between six years eight months and eight years one month who were categorized into three levels of reading ability. Speeded practice was compared to slow-paced constrained-rate practice. The effects of practice and reinforcement were controlled. The utility of learning channel analysis for defining measures of application and adduction, and for measuring adduction on two composite tasks involving topographically dissimilar sensory and response dimensions was examined. Long-term follow-up RESAA measures were conducted three months after the completion of the intervention.
 
 The results of Study 1 indicated a procedure in which accuracy and rate were trained simultaneously was more efficient in increasing component skill rates and produced higher rates on the RESAA measures than training accuracy to 100% in a stage before rate-building commenced for the Year 2 children and two pre-primary children. Training accuracy to 100% before rate-building was marginally more efficient for five of the pre-primary children. Adduction was greater for a one learning-channel cross than for a two learning-channel cross.
 
 The results of Study 2 demonstrated that systematic increases in component skill rates were produced by both the rate-building and constrained-rate procedures, although higher rates were produced by the rate-building procedures for eleven of the twelve children. Higher training rates of the component skills produced concurrently higher rates on repeated RESAA measures during the intervention and on RESAA follow-up measures. Adduction was greater for a two learning-channel cross than for a one learning-channel cross. The level of reading ability of the children did not influence training rates of the component skill but did affect performances on the RESAA measures. Comparisons indicated that different training rates predicted different RESAA outcomes for all of the children.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/504/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The restoration of Israel: Ezekiel 36-39 in early Jewish interpretation: a textual-comparative study of the oldest extant Hebrew and Greek manuscripts</field><field name="creator">Crane, Ashley Stewart</field><field name="description">While many have noted the differences between the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts for Ezekiel, they have done so largely to rediscover an earlier Hebrew text, or to determine which variant preserves the better reading, frequently with the aim of establishing a 'critical text' for their commentaries. This often leaves the other variant(s) in a sense 'incorrect', often attributed to various forms of scribal error.
 
 This thesis adopts a 'textual-comparative' methodology that accords each textual witness equal status as an interpretive trajectory, enabling each to be 'heard' in its own right. The aim of this thesis is to examine these different witnesses with a view to determine what they might tell us about the way Ezekiel 36-39 was interpreted by each particular community. This entails comparing the oldest extant Hebrew and Greek texts both intra-linguistically and trans-linguistically, noting any variants, and exploring possible interpretive reasons for them.  
 
 This study finds that the Greek translators were familiar with both languages, and that they often exegetically and interpretively interacted with the text before them. The Greek (LXX) is both translation and interpretation of the Hebrew. Other interpretations are found in 'inserts' or 'plusses', occurring in both the Hebrew and Greek texts. 
 
 Included is an examination of Papyrus 967 (G967), which exhibits a different chapter order (chapter 37 follows 38-39), and is minus 36:23c-38. Rather than finding that these differences result from error, or that G967 is a maverick text, we find that it is closest to what was probably the Hebrew Urtext. All other extant Hebrew and Greek texts then exhibit theological interaction; the change of chapter order exhibiting a 'call to arms', and the inserted pericope (36:23c-38) exhibiting a 'call to purity'. Our research methodology thus elucidates the earliest Jewish interpretation of the Restoration of Israel in Ezekiel 36-39 (ca. 200-50 BCE).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/505/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of the world bank's socio-institutional neoliberalism</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Toby James</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the so called post-Washington consensus (PWC) and the role of the World Bank in its promotion and implementation. It argues that the PWC represents the promotion of a new form of neoliberalism - socio-institutional neoliberalism (SIN) - which stems from the conflict and contradiction associated with the Washington consensus based around earlier neoliberal prescriptions such as fiscal discipline, trade liberalisation and privatisation. While seeking the continued extension of liberal markets attempted by proponents of the Washington consensus, SIN rigorously specifies the institutional elements that neoliberals now see markets requiring. It stipulates a particular state form and even allocates roles to specific social institutions. Vitally, SIN is not just about policy content. Indeed, it is an attempt to shape the very environment through which policy can be contested. To this end, SIN includes important delivery devices and political technologies to aid with embedding reform, in an attempt to resolve one of the major problems for the Washington consensus: insufficient progress in reform implementation.
 
 SIN is highly political in terms of its ideological commitments, the policy matrices that these commitments generate and the processes by which the implementation of reform is attempted. As a political programme, SIN seeks nothing less than the embedding of a form of governance that attempts to contain the inevitable clashes associated with the extension of market relations. While this attempt at extending market relations inextricably links the Washington consensus with the PWC, it is the substantive efforts and new methods associated with the latter to deliver and deeply embed policy which make it distinct.
 
 Yet SIN continues to face differing degrees of acceptance and resistance in the underdeveloped world. Here it is essential to consider internal Bank dynamics, relations between the Bank and member countries, and the various alliances and conflicts within these countries and their involvement in either promoting or resisting SIN reform. A feature of this thesis is the analytical framework that allows systematic consideration of these diverse political dynamics. Crucially, the reality of such political dynamics means that there is often a significant gap between what the World Bank promotes and what occurs on the ground.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/506/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An olive branch for Sante (a novel) ; and, The Italian diaspora in Australia and representations of Italy and Italians in Australian narrative</field><field name="creator">Casella, Antonio</field><field name="description">This PhD presentation comprises two pieces of work:
 I
 The Italian Diaspora in Australia and Representations of Italy and Italians in Australian Narrative (Research thesis)
 II
 An Olive Branch for Sante (A novel)
 ...................
 In the Introduction of my research titled: Diaspora: A Theoretical Review, I look at the evolution of diasporic Studies and how the great movements of people that have occurred in the past one hundred and fifty years have altered our perception of what is undoubtedly a global phenomenon.
 
 In Chapter One, which I have titled: In Search of an Italian Diaspora in Australia, I consider the kinds of socio-cultural nuclei that have evolved among the Italian population of Australia, out of the mass migration which occurred largely in the post war years. I discuss Italian migration as a whole, the historical and political conditions which brought about mass migration and the subsequent dispersion of Italian nationals, their regrouping into various clusters and how these fit into the patchwork that is the contemporary Australian society. Finally I review the conditions in the host country which facilitated or hindered particular socio-cultural formations and how these may differ from those occurring in other countries.
 
 Chapter Two deals with, The Narrative of Non-Italian Writers. The chapter looks at the images and myths of Italy perpetrated in the literature written by English-speaking authors over the centuries. I begin with the legacy left by British writers such as E.M. Forster, then move on to Australian writers of non-Italian background, such as Judah Waten, Nino Culotta (John O' Grady) and Helen Garner. In Chapter Three: Italo-Australian Writers, I focus on two writers: Venero Armanno and Melina Marchetta, both born in Australia of Italian parents. This section ties in with the earlier discourse on the continuity of the Italian Diaspora in Australia, into the second and subsequent generations.
 
 In Chapter Four, titled: Literature of Nostalgia: The Long Journey, I will reflect upon my own journey as a writer, beginning with my earlier work, including the short stories and the plays, and concluding with a close look at the present novel, which is a companion piece to the research.
 
 The novel complements the research in that it deals with the eternal issues of migration: displacement, change and identity. The protagonists are two young people: Ira-Jane and Sante. The first is not a migrant, but she is touched by migration, insofar as an old Italian couple play grandparents to her, in the early years of her life. When they return to Sicily the child is left with her neglectful and unstable mother. At age twenty-four Ira-Jane goes to Sicily on an assignment, and there she tries to get in touch with her 'grandparents'. She meets up with eighteen-year-old Sante who turns out to be her half brother. The novel's structure juxtaposes two countries, two cultures, two way of looking at the world. It sets up a series of contrasts: the old society and the new, past and present, tradition and innovation, stability and change, repression and freedom. The end of the novel proposes a symbolic bridging between two countries, which are similar in some ways, very different in others. It offers not a solution but a different approach to the eternal dilemma of people living in a diaspora, inhabiting an indefinite space between two countries and for whom home will always be somewhere else.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/507/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exposures and health effects among field workers using the organophosphate chlorpyrifos</field><field name="creator">Cattani, Marcus Paul</field><field name="description">Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide moderately toxic to humans via inhalation and dermal absorption (LD50 oral, rat = 226 mg kg-1, LD50 skin, rabbits = 1265 mg kg-1), is widely used to eradicate termites in Australia. A series of 28 surveys totaling 32 separate assessments, or 10% of all professional users in Perth, Western Australia, comprised biological monitoring, exposure assessment techniques, a health symptoms and work practices questionnaire. Chlorpyrifos metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and alkyl phosphates were extracted from urine, and serum cholinesterase (SChE) and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase from blood. Chlorpyrifos was extracted from 24 patches removed from a supplied cotton overall, cotton gloves worn under protective gloves, 7 absorbent patches placed on the skin and an organic vapour collection tube. Surface wipes were collected in the workers vehicle and on the workers forehead. Chlorpyrifos was applied in either 0.5% (n=2) or 1% (n=26) concentration of active ingredient in water solution. Surveys took place at pre-construction sites (n=5) where pesticide was sprayed onto a prepared site, existing buildings with concrete foundations (n=17) where pesticide was injected under pressure around the perimeter of the building and existing buildings with suspended floors requiring the worker to spray under floor (n=6). Combined left and right glove deposition was 9 mg hour- 1 (SD = 18 mg.hour-1). Mean deposition on overalls was 14 mg.hour-1 (SD = 12 mg.hour-1), on skin patches was 0.2 mcg cm-1.hour-1, on vehicle gear-stick was 3 mcg (SD = 8 mcg) and, on steering wheels was 3 mcg (SD = 3 mcg). The mean protection 4 factor of overalls, a ratio of outer layer and inner levels, was 75 (SD = 411).
 
 Mean air concentration of chlorpyrifos during an application was 30 mcg m-3, and 17 mcg m-3 8 hour TWA (SD = 40 mcg m-3 8 hour TWA), and in one group of 17 workers correlated (p&lt;0.05) with ambient air temperature (15 to 38 oC). Urinary metabolites and SChE activity were effective indicators of exposure. The health symptoms questionnaire did not highlight significant health effects. A discrepancy between operators' perception of risk and their actual exposure requires addressing, for example the measured high deposition rate to hands was ineffectively controlled, as 48% or workers wore inappropriate or no gloves and only 26% washed their hands after completing their tasks. All workers indicated in the questionnaire they would wash their hands after completing their tasks. The questionnaire also highlighted a high incidence of poor work practices, 58% spilt the concentrate at least once a week, 74% had recently spilt/splashed diluted chlorpyrifos in their eyes and 90% on their boots, and 52% believed they would benefit from more education concerning chlorpyrifos. Observations concluded that workers unnecessarily increased their exposure by poor work practice.
 
 Recommendations include modification to pesticide worker education, licencing and health surveillance systems; an improvement in the understanding of the benefits of a health and safety management systems for employers, and pesticide suppliers taking a stewardship role in the usage of their products.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/509/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant communities of greenstone hills of the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia as analogues for the rehabilitation of rocky waste dumps</field><field name="creator">Chalwell, Shane Thomas Samuel</field><field name="description">The vegetation of greenstone hills in the Kalgoorlie area of the Eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia was studied to identify the key environmental influences on community and species distribution. This information was needed to determine if plant communities of the hills could provide analogues for the rehabilitation of waste rock dumps that are produced as a consequence of open cut mining.
 
 The ridges, slopes and flats adjacent to the main slope were examined and the floristic data sorted into communities. Two structurally and floristically distinct alliances were identified, one dominated by eucalypt species and the other by Acacia quadrimarginea. The eucalypt woodland displayed a taller upper stratum and few groundlayer species and was the dominant vegetation of the flats at the base of the hills. The acacia community was a low woodland and is the dominant vegetation of the hill slopes. Both communities were dominant at an equal number of sites on the ridges of the hills.
 
 An investigation of the environmental variables found that edaphic, rather than topographic, factors were responsible for the community distribution on the hills. The eucalypt woodland showed a strong affinity to soils derived from calcrete, which had higher levels of electrical conductivity and lower exchangeable sodium percentages than the soils of the acacia low woodland. Under such conditions, the clay fraction of the soil remains in a more flocculated state allowing higher rates of water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity compared to the acacia soils. Soil nutrients were found to have a secondary influence on community distribution and had a greater effect on species distribution within alliances.
 
 A study of the seasonal variation in water content of the soils showed that more moisture is retained in the upper soil horizons in the acacia community than in the eucalypt community during the wetter part of the year, indicating the acacia soils had poorer infiltration properties than the eucalypt soils. The distribution of drought tolerant species such as A. quadrimarginea and Prostanthera incurvata was found to be correlated to soil moisture content of the dry season whilst no correlation was found for the eucalypts at any time of the year.
 
 Seasonal comparisons of leaf moisture content and xylem pressure potential showed that the eucalypts maintained their total leaf moisture content throughout the year whereas species such as A. quadrimarginea and Allocasuarina campestris recorded high levels of desiccation of their leaf tissue over the summer. The eucalypts also maintained a more consistent pre-dawn xylem pressure potential throughout the year than either A. quadrimarginea or the shrub species Dodonaea microzyga, indicating a greater degree of stomatal control and access to a more consistent soil water supply. The eucalypts require access to a greater soil volume than the acacias or shrubs in order to ensure sufficient water supplies for the maintenance of tissue moisture levels throughout the year. In this way, the eucalypts are able to effectively avoid the summer drought, whereas the acacias and shrubs are able to tolerate desiccation of their leaf tissues over this period.
 
 Investigations of the germination requirements and early seedling survival of prominent species from the greenstone hills indicated that fire may be a factor in the regeneration of most hills species. All studied species were either tolerant of or responded positively to the application of dry heat. In relation to seedling establishment on waste dumps, increasing the soil moisture content of waste dump soils increased the germination rate of most species but did not result in greater seedling survival at the end of the first summer. The provision of microsites which encouraged root development and provided protection for the young seedlings was found to be more important in reducing mortality rates in the first year than increasing the total germination.
 
 The study emphasized the importance of physical soil factors and the soil moisture regime in the distribution of eucalypt and acacia communities on the greenstone hills. A species' response to drought stress strongly influences its ability to compete for soil water on different soil types. The eucalypts studied in this project dominated on soils where there is better recharge of subsoil water reserves which can be accessed over the summer period to maintain tissue water levels. Acacias are tolerant of tissue desiccation and will compete successfully on shallower soils and where hydraulic conductivity is poor.
 
 Although the project was valuable in identifying water relations as the main control on community distribution on the hills, waste dumps are not strictly analogues of intact greenstone hills due to the differences in rock type and profile formation. Electrical conductivity levels are also higher due to extraction processes. However, the environmental relationships of the different species show that the more drought tolerant species such as Allocasuarina campestris, Acacia quadrimarginea and understorey species associated with them, may be suitable species to form the basis of vegetation reinstatement on waste dumps in the Kalgoorlie region.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/510/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Individual team and organizational learning: underpinnings of competitive advantage</field><field name="creator">Chan, Christopher Ching Ann</field><field name="description">Many academicians and practitioners have recognized that organizational learning is a viable paradigm for contemporary organizations aspiring to attain competitive advantage in an increasingly turbulent business environment. Despite tremendous interest in endeavoring to understand the nature of learning organizations, there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support the anecdotal claims that learning in organizations results in positive outcomes such as team performance, service quality, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Most studies either focus on the antecedents and obstacles to learning or speculate how learning produces positive outcomes. Consequently, the purpose of this research was to examine the interactions of individual, team and organizational learning and to examine how learning at the three levels contributed to competitive advantage. In the framework of this study competitive advantage was conceptualized to be made up of team performance, service quality, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment.
 
 Accordingly, a cross-sectional study was conducted at a 230-bed capacity Australian hospital. The study respondents were drawn from all fill time hospital workers - nurses, executives, managers, professions allied to health, administration and clerical workers. As the doctors are contracted, they were not surveyed. All respondents completed a complex questionnaire. In addition to demographic information, the instruments used in the questionnaire included the Individual Learning Scale (Arnes and Archer, 1988), Team Learning Survey (Edrnondson, 1996), Organizational Learning Survey (Goh and Richards, 1997), Team Performance Survey (Edmondson, 1996), SERVQUAL (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, 1991), job satisfaction section of the Job Diagnostic Survey (Hackman and Oldham, 1979, and Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (Porter, Steers, Mowday, and Boulian, 1976). These instruments were deliberately chosen because of their previously recorded acceptable psychometric properties (i.e. validity and reliability) in similar assessments, and hence, they were considered appropriate for the purpose of this study.
 
 A comprehensive methodology was used to assess the hypotheses. Relevant literature pertaining to the variables examined in this study was reviewed. In light of the literature review, a number of hypotheses and a conceptual model were developed. A quantitative methodology was used to test the proposed hypotheses and qualitative information was sought to provide some explanation of the results. This pluralist approach is gaining recognition in contemporary research because of the complementary nature of qualitative to quantitative methodology (Edmondson, 1996; Shaffer and Harrison, 2001). In total 700 questionnaires were administered for completion during a period of two weeks. A total of 189 questionnaires were returned, generating an overall response rate of 27.0 percent. The lower-than-expected response rate was a concern, as biasness in results could occur (Churchill, 1991; Hunt, 1990), so a non-response bias assessment was conducted by comparing early and late respondents (Rulke, Zaheer, and Anderson, 2000; Wright, 1997). The results indicated no grave problem with non-response bias, and therefore, the data was deemed suitable for analyses.
 
 Several statistical procedures were employed to evaluate the data. For example, factor analyses and reliability analyses were used to assess the psychometric properties of the scales. The results of psychometric assessments indicated that the scales had good validities and reliabilities, and the data was robust. Then, path analysis was used to test the hypotheses, which were developed in Chapter Two. The results of path analysis indicated that individual learning was negatively related to team learning, two service quality facets, and two organizational learning facets. Also, the predictions that team learning would enhance organizational learning and team performance were fully supported. Furthermore, the relationships between organizational learning and three relevant outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and service quality) received some support. Finally, it was found that three job satisfaction facets were related to organizational commitment. Implications for these findings are comprehensively discussed in the implications section of Chapter Five. A feature of this study is the use of informal focus groups to improve the understanding of statistical results. The Quality Coordinator of the hospital organized seven sessions and every employee was invited to attend. Each session lasted fifteen to twenty minutes. The Chief Executive Officer, who attended most the sessions, displayed tremendous interest and support for the study. There were two objectives for the informal discussions. Firstly, this strategy allowed a better interpretation of the results from the mindsets of some employees. During the sessions, attendees were asked to recall instances that support the findings. Secondly, the session allowed staff members to discuss any job-related issues with the Quality Coordinator and Chief Executive Officer. Indeed, as suggested by contemporary management researchers (Bond, Fu, and Pasa, 2001; de Ruyter, Moorman, and Lemrnink, 2001; Teagarden, Von Glinow, Bowen, Frayne, Nason, Huo, Milliman, Arias, Butler, Geringer, Kim, Scullion, Lowe, and Drost, 1995), this informal qualitative approach was complementary to the statistical method.
 
 The study represents an original attempt to empirically examine the individual, team and organizational learning constructs and their outcomes. Discussion of results is preceded by a review of the outcomes of individual learning, which include team learning, organizational learning, and service quality. Next, the outcomes of team learning, such as organizational learning, team performance and service quality, are discussed. Subsequently, the effects of organizational learning on job satisfaction, organizational commitment and service quality are discussed. The discussion is concluded with explanations for the reciprocal relationship between the affective variables of job satisfaction and organizational commitment as well as the effects of the two variables on service quality. Following the discussion of results, the limitations and strengths of the study are presented. Finally, suggestions for future research are provided.
 
 A number of theoretical and practical contributions have resulted from this study. These can be broadly summarized to include four features. The first contribution of this study is an advancement of the currently available knowledge about individual, team and organizational learning by empirically examining the linkages. A second contribution of the study is an assessment of the appropriateness of the Individual Learning Survey, Team Learning Survey, Organizational Learning Survey, and the SERVQUAL instrument in assessing learning capabilities and service quality in the context of an Australian hospital, with the potential of a wider application across the health care industry. Next, evidence supporting the organizational learning facets that have contributed to employee attitude and behavior, such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment, may help bolster arguments for initiatives to improve the quality of life of health care staff. Finally, identifying the organizational learning facets that have contributed to service quality has the potential to encourage hospital management to incorporate human resource policies into operational plans to improve service quality. Implications of the findings for managers and theory developments are discussed comprehensively in Chapter Five.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/511/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory of cooperative learning as incentive-values-exchange: studies of the effects of task-structures, rewards and ability on academic and social-emotional measures of mathematics learning</field><field name="creator">Chan, Su Hoon</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis is concerned with the social psychology of cooperative learning and its effects in cognitive and social-emotional domains. It comprises two main studies and two exploratory studies undertaken during two 10-day, 16-hour learning intervention programmes for Maths Word Problem-Solving (MWPS), respectively for 285 and 451 Grade-5 students in Singapore.
 
 Study 1 used a quasi-experimental design to investigate the outcomes of task-structures in an Individual Learning condition and three dyadic Cooperative Learning conditions that varied in the key elements: positive interdependence, individual accountability and group goals. The results indicated that a Cooperative Learning condition with a high level of positive interdependence in combination with a low level of individual accountability resulted in significantly lower MWPS academic achievement and peer-self-concept outcomes than the other conditions; whereas the other Cooperative conditions with lower levels of positive interdependence did not differ significantly from the Individual Learning condition in MWPS academic outcomes but produced better peer-self-concept outcomes. The discussion theorises how task-structured positive interdependence in cooperative conditions can potentially be so rigid that it limits individual control in overcoming a dyadic partner's error. In turn, this increases the likelihood that members of dyads would 'sink together' (rather than 'swim together') - which appears to produce relatively worse MWPS academic outcomes as well as being detrimental to peer-self-concept outcomes. Therefore, optimal cooperative learning conditions for mathematics should allow interaction amongst student partners but not preclude individual control over any stage of the learning task.
 
 Study 2 comprised three interrelated investigations of the effects of rewarding learning behaviours and the effects of ability-structures on Individual, Equals (homogeneous) and Mixed (heterogeneous) dyads. All children were eligible to be rewarded for their own MWPS academic mastery achievements, but comparison groups in each of the ability-structures were either eligible or not eligible to be rewarded for displaying target learning behaviours (LB-Rewards or No-LB-Rewards). The academic programme was based on Polya's problem-solving strategies of understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and checking the results. Children in all learning conditions were instructed to use these problem-solving strategies and, according to their differently assigned learning conditions, to use learning behaviours (LB-s) either 'for helping oneself' in Individual conditions or 'helping one's partner' in Equals and Mixed conditions. In 'LB-Rewards' conditions, teachers rewarded the children's displays of the assigned behaviours for learning alone or learning together, whereas in 'LB-No-Rewards' conditions they did not.
 
 The investigation in Study 2a encompassed the same dependent variables as Study 1. The results indicated that for maths (MWPS), Learning Behaviour rewards were detrimental to Individual Learning conditions with significantly lower MWPS gains when the rewards were used compared to when they were not, whereas the opposite pattern was found for Equals where the effects of Learning Behaviour significantly enhanced MWPS outcomes. For peer-self-concept, effects varied across the Cooperative conditions' Learning Behaviour rewards conditions. An exploratory analysis of High-, Low- and Medium-ability revealed patterns of the inter-relationships between ability-structures and effects of rewarding.
 
 Study 2b is exploratory and involved traversing the traditional theoretical dichotomy of individual vs social learning, to develop a measure combining them both in 'self-efficacy for learning maths together and learning maths alone'. The effects of the various experimental conditions on factors in this measure were explored, allowing detailed insight into the complex, multi-dimensional and dynamic inter-relationships amongst all the variables. The findings have been developed into a theory of Incentive-values-Exchange in Individual- and Cooperative-learning, arguing that there are four main cooperative learning dimensions - 'individual cognitive endeavour', 'companionate positive influence', 'individualistic attitudes development' and 'social-emotional endeavour'. The argument is that students' motivation to learn cooperatively is the product of perceived equalization of reward-outcomes in relation to each dyadic member's contributions to learning-goals on these dimensions. Hence, motivation varies across ability-structures and reward-structures in a complex manner. A further proposition of the theory is that social-emotional tendencies and biases form a dynamic system that tends to maintain dyadic partners' achievement levels relative to their ability-positioning.
 
 Study 2c is exploratory and extends Study 2b by illustrating its Incentive-values-Exchange theory. Samples of children's written descriptive reflections of their experiences in cooperative dyads are provided to illustrate the point made about the children's relationships and effects on each other for each of the factors on the individual- and cooperative-learning scales. As such, this section of the thesis offers a parsimonious explanation of cooperative learning and the effects of various learning conditions on the integrated cognitive, social and emotional domains.
 
 Practical implications in light of the study's findings of optimal conditions include the possibility of practitioners more closely tailoring cooperative learning conditions to meet the academic or social-emotional needs of learners at specific ability levels. Future directions for research include testing some of the learning dimensions and proposed theoretical configurations for them using controls identified by the statistical analyses together with qualitative observations, and further developing new methodologies for investigating the social-psychological causes and consequences of learning motivation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/512/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between textual criticism and the synoptic question: a study based on the passion narrative</field><field name="creator">Chan Chim Yuk, Marc</field><field name="description">Since the eighteenth century, various hypotheses have been proposed by scholars in an attempt to solve the Synoptic Question.  Most of these scholars have used more or less the same Greek text, yet they have come up with different conclusions.  So, the question arises whether it is possible to find a trend in the manuscripts dating up to the fifth century which sheds additional clues on the relationships among the Synoptic Gospels.  To address this, I have taken the text of the 27th edition of Nestle-Aland as the basis for analysis through the use of the colour-coded scheme proposed by the Karawara Gospels Project.  However, in the same colour-coding exercise, the variant readings from the relevant manuscripts are also displayed.  This facilitates the identification of any particularities. 
 
 Since the Synoptic Gospels contain too much to cover within the constraints of this research project, there is a need to select enough material to make the study relevant.  The passion narrative has been selected on the basis of its content and the generally agreed closeness of the texts in all three Synoptic Gospels.  So, all the sections, as defined in the Aland Synopsis, in the Triple Tradition are colour-coded and analysed.  The relevant variant readings in these sections are also taken into consideration.  To display the colour-coding more accurately, it was found that a commonly used and available format is more appropriate since printing is still not a viable alternative.  Thus, all the colour-coded sections, as found on the attached CD ROM, are converted into the PDF format and the Adobe Acrobat Reader, widely available through the Internet, can be used to view them.  This study has pointed out that in spite of the commonly agreed closeness of the texts, that of Luke varies quite markedly from the other two.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/513/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genome-level studies on late maturity alpha amylase and boron tolerance in wheat</field><field name="creator">Carter, Meredith Diane</field><field name="description">Under certain environmental conditions, some varieties of wheat synthesize the enzyme alpha amylase late in grain ripening, even in the absence of rain or sprouting. The resulting grain has a sound appearance but can be unsuitable for end-product applications due to the presence of late maturity alpha amylase (LMA) activity. Reduction of LMA and the development of cultivars tolerant to boron toxic soils are high priority traits in the WA wheat breeding program and the use of molecular markers closely linked to these traits for marker assisted selection (MAS) is highly desirable. The aims of this study were to take a genomics approach to provide detailed structural information for the region on wheat chromosome 7BL in which quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for LMA and boron tolerance (Bo1) have been mapped. Once the structure had been determined, this then laid the foundation for further studies to investigate the function of putative candidate genes identified within this region. The research involved the use of bioinformatic tools and rice/wheat synteny to investigate the structure of this chromosome region, followed by the use of molecular probes to isolate genomic DNA clones (BAC clones) corresponding to this region.
 
 A two-step bioinformatics strategy was used, involving (1) alignment of portions of the wheat and rice genomes, to identify rice genomic regions syntenic to wheat group 7L and (2) selection of candidate genes from those regions of the rice genome. The selected candidate genes included an anion transporter, as a candidate gene for boron tolerance, and GAMYB-like genes, as candidate genes for LMA. The GAMYB class of transcription factors identified were of particular interest because of published literature indicating its importance in controlling alpha-amylase levels in cereal grains. The key phenotype of interest in this thesis is LMA and different levels of expression of &#194;&#177;-amylase are a key feature of this phenotype.
 
 Molecular markers and candidate genes were then used to screen two BAC libraries, one derived from the French cultivar, 'Renan' and the other derived from Aegilops tauschii (the source of the D genome of wheat). About 300 BAC clones corresponding to the chromosome region of interest were obtained. Of these, 8 BAC clones (6 chosen through hybridization to a GAMYB-like probe, and 2 from wheat ESTs anchored to the rice genome) were selected for sequencing, allowing for the development of new microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and for the discovery of novel transposable elements that provide a rich source of polymorphism for the development of additional markers. Novel microsatellite and SNP markers that were identified from the BAC clone sequence were mapped on the Cranbrook/Halberd doubled haploid (DH) mapping population. Markers were located to chromosomes 7AL, 7BL and 7DL. New markers derived from the BAC sequence information were used to anchor the BAC clones to the genetic map and develop a framework physical-genetic map. An automated annotation pipeline has been established and was used to annotate selected contigs of the sequenced BAC clones.
 
 A new marker assisted selection strategy, termed Multiplex Trait Signature (MuTs) analysis, was developed and tested on 39 wheat cultivars of known LMA phenotype. MuTs provides a graphical genotype of individuals for a particular chromosomal region and is a convenient tool for interrogating genetic similarity in the individuals surveyed. Based on assays of 22 markers (12 spanning the LMA QTL on chromosome 7BL and 10 spanning the LMA QTL on chromosome 3BS) on these 39 wheat cultivars, it was found that the varieties can be grouped according to pedigree and provides a tool for interpreting LMA status for a variety. Validation of the 7BL LMA and boron tolerance (Bo1) QTL regions was achieved using a targeted mapping approach using the doubled haploid population Pastor/RAC891 using published molecular markers and markers developed in this thesis. The main outcome of this study is that the genomic organisation of this region on chromosome 7BL is complex, and that the identification of candidate genes in wheat controlling 1) tolerance of cultivars to boron toxic soils and 2) pathways regulating the expression of LMA, is likely to involve the interplay of a network of regulatory genes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/514/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of the spotted minnow Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns 1842) (Pisces: Galaxiidae) on the south coast of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Andrew</field><field name="description">The spotted minnow, Galaxias maculatus has a widespread southern hemisphere and circum-polar distribution including south-western and south-eastern Australia. It was sampled at monthly intervals over 12-18 months, by seine and plankton netting at three localities including a freshwater lake, Moates Lake, and two intermittently flowing, naturally saline rivers, the Jerdacuttup and the Oldfield rivers on the south coast of Western Australia.
 
 The resulting data provided an opportunity to describe the biology of G. maculatus in some detail including; environmental variables, life cycle, larval development, diet and parasitism by platyhelminth and nematode worms. Comparisons were made with other studies in south-east Australia, including Tasmania, and New Zealand. The present study confirmed that, at least throughout most of its range in Western Australia, G. maculatus has established a self-sustaining land-locked reproductive strategy. It is hypothesised that the development of land-locked breeding is an adaptive response to changing coastal geomorphology in the Holocene period that restricted ocean access of rivers and their fauna and caused estuaries to become non-tidal.
 
 The principal conclusion arising is that the local biology differs largely in degree rather than kind from elsewhere it has been studied; differences in degree are interpreted as local adaptations to an environment that is both variable and unpredictable Field measurement of environmental variables revealed G. maculatus will withstand salinities to approximately 46 ppt and surface water temperatures to 280 c. Very low dissolved oxygen concentrations to &lt;1.0 mg r1 are accommodated by practicing secondary aerial respiration at the water surface.
 
 Galaxias maculatus on the south coast of Western Australia were smaller than those reported from populations elsewhere. Overall tota11engths of Western Australian males and females ranged 23-132 mm compared to 38-187 mm length to caudal fork for south-west Victoria, 31-185 mm standard length for Tasmania and 40-152 mm length to caudal fork for New Zealand fish. In the present study, size varied between the lake and one river population that was smaller. It is hypothesised that reduction in size of Western Australian G. maculatus generally is an adaptive response to avoid predation by piscivorous birds in shallow, confined river pools and lakes.
 
 There was a well defined, albeit extended, breeding season between autumn and spring with peak spawning in winter. The season was longer in the relatively stable lake situation and shorter ~ the very variable river situation partly due to the influence of river flow, which is continuous into the lake and intermittent and variable in the rivers. A flow dependent upstream spawning migration was part of the reproductive strategy but there was also the capacity, in certain circumstances, of spawning on falling water levels in years of nil or little flow.
 
 There was an almost complete cessation of reproductive activity during summer. Fecundity ranged from 296-2 874 eggs with a mean of 912 and was positively correlated with total length. The overall total lengths at which 50% of females and males and attain sexual maturity were estimated at 52 and 49 mm total length, respectively. For 95% of females and males the total lengths were estimated at 74 and 62mm total length, respectively.
 
 Ageing by counting annual growth rings was successful for lake inhabiting fish only, the lack of consistency in growth rings in the river environments was attributed to the extreme variability of these environments. The von Bertalanffy growth equation predicted that, on average, at the end of their first, second and third years females were 61, 81 and 88 mm total length respectively. Male predictions were 56, 74 and 80 mm, respectively. Approximately 75% of males and 62% of females attained sexual maturity at the end of their first year. Excluding larval fish, 73.1, 22.7, 4.1 and 0.1 % were 0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+ fish, respectively. The overall sex ratio females:males was 1.09:1.0, the ratio favoured males for very small fish but favoured females as fish aged and grew.
 
 Larval development was described in detail for the first time for Australian G. maculatus. The sequence of fin development was the same as that reported for galaxiids elsewhere, i.e. caudal, dorsal, anal, pectoral and pelvic. Adult fin ray counts were; cauda1 16, dorsa1 9, anal 13, pectoral 12 and pelvic 6-7. Myomeres ranged from 45-50. Development of pigmentation and dentition were described; caniniform teeth began to develop during the late postflexion larval stage.
 
 Dietary analysis confirmed a previous description of G. maculatus as an euryphagic carnivore. A wide range of invertebrate food groups including copepods, amphipods and ostracods, aquatic insects as well as terrestrial invertebrates (spiders, winged ants and orthopterans) were consumed. Most variation in diet was explained by site, i.e whether fish were from river or lake environments or which river environment. A lack of replicate samples precluded a rigorous statistical analysis of the influence of either fish size or season on diet. However, a provisional analysis suggested these variables have minimal influence. Larval diets comprised copepods, cladocerans and unicellular algae; with the attainment of postflexion larval stage and development of caniniform dentition, a wider range of dietary items were ingested.
 
 One cestode, one trematode and two nematode larval worms infected river and lake inhabiting fish. The cestode, Ligula intestinalis, infected 13% of lake inhabiting fish causing gross disfiguration and probably reduced reproductive success, particularly of males. The degree and severity of cestode infection was much less in rivers, perhaps due to their saline waters. The worms' adult hosts in all cases were piscivorous waterfowl particularly the white-faced heron.
 
 At present G. maculatus is widespread and abundant throughout its range in Western Australia. As most of its range is in rivers and lakes which are, and will in the future be influenced by clearing for agriculture, it is likely that increased river recharge due to clearing will initially benefit G. maculatus. However long term change, particularly changes to riparian vegetation structure and species composition, are likely eventually to be inimical as the shading value of vegetation and its habitat value for terrestrial invertebrate food are diminished.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/650/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sediment remediation as a technique for restoring eutrophic wetlands and controlling nuisance Chironomidae</field><field name="creator">Chen, Juan</field><field name="description">Eutrophication is a global problem affecting many inland and estuarine waters. Many wetlands on the Swan Coast Plain, in Western Australia, have undergone increasing nutrient enrichment since European settlement of the region in the 1850's. Problems such as algal blooms and nuisance swarms of non-biting midges (Diptera; Chironomidae) are the consequence of nutrient enrichment in many of these wetlands. The restoration of these degraded wetlands, especially with respect to reducing nutrient enrichment, requires a range of comprehensive and effective techniques including catchment management, diversion or treatment of surface inputs and treatment of enriched sediments. Nitrogen and phosphorus, especially phosphorus, are not the only factors controlling algal biomass in water bodies, but they are the only elements that can be removed efficiently and economically.
 
 Internal P cycling from wetland sediments can initiate and sustain eutrophication and related algal blooms and nuisance midge problems even after external sources are diverted or reduced. The aim of this study was to identify an effective material to reduce sediment phosphorus release and thereby the phosphorus concentration of the water column. It was also important to determine the impact of the selected amendment material on phytoplankton and larval midge (chironomid) communities.
 
 A range of experiments at increasing scales, from bench-top, to microcosm to outdoor mesocosm experiments were designed to test three hypotheses:
 
 1) Materials which have a high P sorption capacity, over a wide range of P solution concentrations, and low P release rate, are potentially suitable agents to reduce P in wetlands with enriched sediments by inactivating sediment P;
 2) A reduction in the abundance of cyanobacteria caused by increasing the N:P ratio of an aquatic ecosystem results in a reduction in the density of nuisance species of Chironomidae.
 3) Successful amendment of enriched sediments reduces P in the water column thereby reducing the total phytoplankton biomass and the related density of nuisance species of Chironomidae.
 
 The adsorption and desorption experiments were carried out under a range of pH values and P concentrations, with a number of materials including fly ash, red mud, precipitated calcium carbonate, crushed limestone and lime to determine the maximum adsorption capacity and affinity of these materials. A rang of P concentrations (0-1000 mcg/L) simulated the P concentration of the water column in a range of wetlands of differing trophic status. Poor fits to the Langmuir equation occurred with both red mud and fly ash due to their high P content. A good fit occurred with lime, with a high P removal rate (90%-96%) over the same range. Fly ash and red mud were eliminated from further investigation due to the possibility that they might release phosphorus rather than absorb when P concentrations in surrounding environment were less than 300 mcg/L or 200 mcg/L respectively (concentrations which can occur in eutrophic systems).
 
 Among the three lime-based, redox-insensitive materials tested in the second mesocosm experiments, precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) possessed the highest maximum adsorption capacity and lowest desorption rate under a range of pH values (6.2, 7.2 and 10) and P concentrations (0-12 000 mcg/L), followed by crushed limestone and lime. The different maximum absorption capacities of the three materials appears to be mainly attributed to their particle size (surface area).
 
 Lime was chosen as the amendment material for further investigation because it was the only one of the three available in sufficient quantities within the timeframe of this study.
 
 Microcosm experiments showed that lime was effective in reducing sediment P release from intact sediment cores, and the ratio of TN:TP in the treatment cores increased over time compared to the control cores (in which TN: TP decreased slightly).
 
 In the first mesocosm experiment a significantly higher density of larval midges was found in the treatments than in the controls. The treatments were aimed to increase N:P ratio in the systems to reduce cyanobacteria and, subsequently, larval midge densities. However even though cyanobacteria were eliminated from the treatments, the nitrogen addition appeared to result in higher phytoplankton biomass overall, which fuelled an increase in larval midge densities.
 
 In the second mesocosm experiment, the addition of lime to enriched sediments resulted in a reduction in P in the water column. This reduction was accompanied by a reduction in total phytoplankton biomass, the absence of cyanobacteria, and a less abundant and more species - diverse chironomid fauna in the treatment mesocosms.
 
 Sediment P fractionation undertaken for both the microcosm and mesocosm experiments showed that most of the phosphorus adsorbed by lime was in the labile fraction (NH3Cl extractable P and NaOH extractable P). Phosphorus in the HCl extractable fraction was also found to be higher in the treatments due to the presence of inert mineral P in the lime than the formation of new hydroxyapatite from adsorbed P.
 
 The two mesocosm experiments suggested that larval midges were non-selective feeders, responding to total phytoplankton biomass, rather than the presence of cyanobacteria. Dissolved oxygen and predation also influenced larval midge densities.
 
 In summary, although lime appeared to be a useful material for reducing P release from enriched sediments under controlled laboratory conditions, the effect under field conditions was not as definitive. Further work is required to more fully determine the conditions under which sediment remediation may be used as a means of controlling sediment P release and associated high densities of larval chironomids.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/651/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taiwanese offshore (distant water) fisheries in Southeast Asia, 1936-1977</field><field name="creator">Chen, Ta-Yuan</field><field name="description">The Japanese colonial fisheries authorities of pre-war Taiwan played an important role in the diffusion of offshore and distant water fishing methods. Two of the main fisheries in post-war Taiwan, the longline and trawl fisheries, were introduced from Japan during the pre-war period. Although Taiwan's fishing industry was devastated in the course of World War Two, with financial aid from the international community and the government's policy guidance, it was revived in a comparatively brief period of time. Fishing vessels from Taiwan, especially Kaohsiung, soon became, once again, a common sight in the waters of Southeast Asia. The first part of thesis traces the pre-war historical background, the government's post-war policy guidance and the birth of Taiwan's offshore and distant water fishing industry in Southeast Asia after World War Two.
 
 After the Chinese communists came to power in 1949 Taiwan's fishing communities were placed under the strict surveillance of the Kuomintang authorities out of consideration for national security. The Taiwanese Government and the military adopted a variety of measures to control and regulate the development of the fishing communities. Also, the people in the fishing industry did their best to cope with the Government intervention.
 
 To safeguard their onshore business interests, Kaohsiung's fishing companies also put considerable energy and effort into dealing with local shipyards, ice-manufacturers, and other fishing ancillary industries. Vessel owners developed industry partnership with those who were cooperative, and either avoided or boycotted those who were viewed as a potential nemesis. With a view to analysing the interactions between the fishing industry, the Government, the military, and key ancillary industries, the second part of the thesis focuses upon the history of Taiwan's post-war fishing industry from the perspective of the national-industrial level.
 
 The development of Kaohsiung's fishing industry was also deeply affected by ethnic factors. Siao Liouciou fishers were solely dedicated to the longline fishing method; Shandong people preferred to be involved in pair-trawl fishing. The final part of the thesis further narrows down the scope of the history of Taiwan's fishing industry to the local level context of the fishing communities. The histories of six fishing companies are used to compare the cultures and management styles of the trawling and longlining fisheries. Finally, the fishers' daily lives in the waters of Southeast Asia, and the culture and routine practices of Kaohsiung's fishing communities are explored in depth.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/652/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physicochemical properties of nickel and cobalt sulphate solutions of hydrometallurgical relevance</field><field name="creator">Chen, Ting</field><field name="description">Producing nickel and cobalt metal by high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) of nickel laterites is becoming one of Australia's largest mineral processing industries. However, the background chemical information for this process, including the fundamental physicochemical properties of acidic metal sulphate leachate solutions, is not well known. In order to improve the efficiency of current and future HPAL plants, high quality physicochemical and thermodynamic data will be necessary. This thesis reports measurements on the densities and heat capacities of nickel and cobalt sulphate solutions and their mixtures along with detailed studies of the nature of the species present and the thermodynamics of their interconversions.
 
 Densities and heat capacities of nickel and cobalt sulphate and perchlorate solutions and their ternary mixtures were measured using a vibrating tube densimeter and a flow microcalorimeter respectively. These data were used to calculate the apparent molal volumes and heat capacities of these solutions. Standard partial molal quantities were then obtained by appropriate extrapolation procedures, along with the volume and heat capacity changes of ion pair formation. A comparison has been made between experimental densities and heat capacities with those predicted by Young's rule. Good agreement was obtained except when the degree of complexation varied significantly in the mixtures. The various ion pair species in nickel and cobalt sulphate solutions, along with those of magnesium sulphate (which is a major impurity in HPAL leachates), were reinvestigated by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy.
 
 Doubly solvent separated ion pairs, solvent shared ion pairs and contact ion pairs were shown to exist simultaneously in solution and their concentrations were determined from dilute to near-saturated concentrations. Evidence for the possible existence of a triple ion, M2SO4 2+, was also obtained in highly concentrated solutions. The equilibrium constants of the stepwise reactions and the effective hydration numbers of ions and ion pairs were also calculated.
 
 The heats of complexation of nickel(II) and cobalt(II) sulphate were determined at different ionic strengths in sodium perchlorate media by titration calorimetry. These data were fitted to a specific ion interaction model to obtain the standard state values. The corresponding entropies of complexation were calculated and were found to be the major contributor to the stability of the complexes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/653/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The need for approval: a psychological study of the influence of Confucian values on the social behaviour of East Asians</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Stephen Kin Kwok</field><field name="description">This thesis begins with a critical overview of crosscultural psychology and a re-examination of the concepts of emic and etic. It argues that the time has come for cross-cultural psychology to free itself from the moorings of its Western, universalistic paradigm and take non- Western, indigenous psychology seriously, especially that of East Asia.
 
 To address the need for an East Asian psychology, the thesis presents an empirical study on the psychological influence of Confucianism on East Asians. It hypothesises that the Confucian values of filiality, propriety and harmony induce a strong need for approval and a range of approval-seeking behaviours in the individual. In contrast, the Western values of individuation, autonomy and conflict induce a strong need for independence and a range of independence-seeking behaviours.
 
 To test this hypothesis, a 26-item, 5-point Likert scale was developed and'administered to 1625 university students across East Asia, which include East Asian samples from China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as Caucasian samples from Australia, United Kingdom and the United States.
 
 The study has confirmed its hypothesis that the Confucian values of filiality, propriety and harmony characterise the approval-driven social behaviours of East Asians and that the values of individuation, autonomy and conflict characterise the independence-driven social behaviours of Westerners. However, it has also found that, contrary to many long-held assumptions, there are significant differences in the way Confucian values have exerted their respective influence on the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and other East Asians.
 
 The findings suggest not only that the culturally induced need for approval can be used as an overarching construct for the psychological study of East Asians from an indigenous perspective, but also that the innovative model used in this study can be applied to the study of other indigenous psychologies as well. More significantly, the study has found that, in contrast to the need for divine approval which has motivated the achievements of European Protestants in the past, the need for human approval is what characterises the achievement motivation and behaviours of Confucian East Asians today.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/654/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant mechanisms contributing to acid impairment of nodulation of Medicago murex and Medicago sativa by Sinorhizobium medicae</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Yvonne</field><field name="description">The widespread sowing of the perennial forage legume Medicago sativa to lower groundwater tables in south-western Australia is limited as many soils targeted for its use are too acidic (pHCaCl2 &lt; 5) for consistent nodulation with Sinorhizobium spp. The annual medic M. murex grows and nodulates well in these acidic soils, but it cannot fill the niche of M. sativa in lowering groundwater tables. The differential ability of M. murex and M. sativa to nodulate in acid soils provided the opportunity to compare the nodulation responses between the two species and to identify the mechanisms contributing to the poor nodulation of M. sativa in soil of low pH.
 
 An initial glasshouse experiment compared the nodulation of M. murex cv. Zodiac and M. sativa cv. Aquarius with S. medicae strains WSM419 and CC169. Subsequent glasshouse and laboratory experiments used only the more acid-tolerant S. medicae strain WSM419. In the glasshouse in soil of pHCaCl2 4.3, the uppermost nodule on both M. murex and M. sativa formed at 4-5 cm below the hypocotyl, but the nodules on M. sativa formed almost 4 weeks later than those on M. murex. The difference in nodulation response between M. murex and M. sativa was related to numbers of S. medicae in the rhizosphere. After 24 d growth in soil of pHCaCl2 4.3, there were 100-fold higher numbers of S. medicae WSM419 associated with the roots of M. murex than M. sativa. This difference in rhizobial numbers was not due to differences in root growth as there were similar rates of root elongation in M. murex and M. sativa, or differences in the root products released as root exudates of M. murex and M. sativa produced at low pH had no significant effect on the growth of S. medicae.
 
 Using a 'root mat' approach on soil disks of pHCaCl2 4.49, M. sativa acidified its rhizosphere by approximately 0.2 0.4 pH-units within 4 d, while M. murex did not acidify its rhizosphere. Rates of H+ release were higher from M. sativa than from M. murex. Using videodensitometry with agarose of pH 4.5, ature parts of the tap-root of both pecies exuded OH- ions, but this was pproximately 2-times higher in M. murex than in M. sativa. Consequently, oung parts of the M. sativa rhizosphere were more acidic than hat of . murex. The higher rate of acidification by the oots of M. sativa made its hizosphere less favourable for the survival and growth of S. medicae. oot hair development was initially similar for both M. murex and . sativa. However by 7 d after sowing in soil of pHCaCl2 .3, he density of root airs on M. murex increased to 37 root hairs mm-1 root, while the density of root airs on M. sativa decreased to 20 root hairs mm-1 root. Due to higher oot hair density, the roots of M. murex provided a greater surface area for the attachment and colonisation of S. medicae compared to the roots of M. sativa.
 
 Indeed, confocal laser scanning microscopy at 7 d after sowing showed there were larger populations of a green fluorescent protein-marked transconjugant of S. medicae WSM419 colonised at 4-5 cm below the hypocotyl on the root of M. murex (3.28 pixel intensity units) compared to M. sativa (1.78 pixel intensity units). The smaller population of S. medicae colonised on the M. sativa root resulted in the observed delay in nodule development in M. sativa compared to M. murex.
 
 Two plant mechanisms contributed to the greater numbers of S. medicae in the M. murex rhizosphere compared to M. sativa rhizosphere when plants were grown in an acidic soil: (1) roots of M. murex had a higher density of root hairs, and thus provided a larger root surface area for the growth and colonisation of S. medicae than M. sativa, and (2) roots of M. murex acidified the rhizosphere less, and thus provided more favourable conditions for the growth and colonisation of S. medicae than the rhizosphere of M. sativa. Models explaining the different nodulation responses between M. murex and M. sativa in soil of pHCaCl2 4.3 and 7.0 are presented.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/655/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of human resource management practices on the retention of core employees of Australian organisations : an empirical study</field><field name="creator">Chew, Janet Cheng Lian</field><field name="description">Employee retention is one of the challenges facing many business organisations today. For many organisations, strategic staffing has become a concern because the ability to hold on to highly talented core employees can be crucial to future survival. This empirical study examined the current human resource management (HRM) practices of Australian organisations in the retention of their core employees. In particular, the research identified the core elements of HRM practices, which strongly influence the decision for core employees to stay.
 
 The study comprise three phases: (1) a preliminary investigation, utilising the Delphi Technique to obtain the opinions of an expert panel of thirteen, (2) in-depth interviews, involving twelve human resource managers of Australian organisations and (3) a quantitative survey of 800 employees from nine Australian organisations.
 
 The findings revealed greater insights into the HRM-retention relationship and provided empirical validation of the relationship. More specifically, the research identified eight retention factors that influence the decision of core employees to stay. These specific factors consisted of two bundles of practices: HR factors (e.g., person organisational fit, remuneration, reward and recognition, training and career development, challenging job opportunities) and Organisational factors (e.g., leadership behaviour, company culture and policies, teamwork relationship and satisfactory work environment). The outcome of the HRM-retention relationship was examined through organisational commitment and turnover intention using multiple regression analysis.
 
 The findings of this study revealed positive significant co-relationships between the eight factors and organisational commitment. Moreover, it was highlighted that commitment acted as a partial mediator of remuneration, recognition and reward, training and career development and work environment on intent to stay. Commitment fully mediated the relationship person organisational fit, teamwork relationship, culture and policies and intention to stay.
 
 The study produced a model suitable for use by human resource practitioners as a guide in determining what initiatives an organisation should adopt to retain their critical employees.
 
 This research has also made a contribution by illuminating the current employment relationships in Australian organisations and providing relevant empirical evidence to support the theoretical model of Human Resource Architecture, developed by Lepak and Snell (1999) and, as a result, creating a configuration for an Australian Human Resource Architecture model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/656/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-sounding images: sound and image in an audiovisual age</field><field name="creator">Chua, Collin</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the evolving articulation of sound and image in contemporary culture, with particular reference to film. It argues that sound and image have undergone a historical machined separation, followed by a machined fusion or recombination. The machined fusion of sound and image has enabled the creation of soundful images, which are more than simply the sum of their parts. Through the infusion of sound, images are now routinely reinforced with a performed sense of presence, where they are made to sound more real, more powerful, more authentic. Through association with the image, sounds are reinforced to the extent of becoming 'realer than real'. By tracing the history of sound and image from their initial machined separation to their subsequent machined fusion, it will be argued that a new relationship has been created that has shaped an influential new mode of communication and perception.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/657/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pastoral academic divide: impacts and implications for pastoral care</field><field name="creator">Clark, Katherine</field><field name="description">Secondary schools in Australia routinely develop organisational constructs to fulfil their dual obligations of academic teaching and the pastoral care of students. Although these obligations are closely interrelated, school organisational structures are frequently dichotomous, differentiating between the academic roles of teachers and their pastoral responsibilities and can result in a functional divide between the two sides of the school. Teachers find themselves wearing 'two hats'; a subject teacher and a pastoral carer and thus are required to work in two separate domains, the academic and the pastoral, each with distinct and different tasks, expectations and line management. The limited amounts of research available suggest that such an organisational divide can hinder the work of teachers and lead to some organisational confusion within the school. This research took the form of a qualitative case study, based in an independent secondary school in Western Australia. It investigated the impacts and implications of the notional division between the pastoral and academic dimensions of the school. The thesis begins with a review of the understanding and development of pastoral care in schools. The construct of an enabling bureaucracy is then explored and adopted as a theoretical lens with which to examine the pastoral care system from the perspective of teachers, students and senior managers. Narratives are used to present the data. The research findings indicate that alignment of the pastoral and academic structures, both functionally and culturally, can be achieved if an enabling approach is employed. Such alignment allows the pastoral care system to support the primary function of a school which is learning, whilst retaining its fundamental duty of student care. The study concludes with a consideration of how an enabling school culture may improve the provision of pastoral care in schools.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/658/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From chromaffin cells to Phaeochromocytoma: insight into the sympathoadrenal cell lineage</field><field name="creator">Cleary, Susannah</field><field name="description">Chromaffin cells are a modified post-ganglionic sympathetic neuron, which synthesise and secrete catecholamines. The neoplastic transformation of chromaffin cells is demonstrated by the tumour phaeochromocytoma, a functional tumour that recapitulates the normal role of chromaffin cells by synthesising, storing and releasing excess catecholamines. Within this thesis we have explored several aspects of chromaffin cell and phaeochromocytoma tumour biology, including the specific expression of key sympathoadrenal markers such as the noradrenaline transporter (NAT), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and chromogranin A (CGA) in normal human and mouse chromaffin cells versus phaeochromocytomas of human and mouse origin.
 
 Catecholamine-mediated signalling in chromaffin cells is terminated by the sequestration of extracellular catecholamines back into the cell via the noradrenaline transporter (NAT). Following observations that within the rat adrenal medulla, NAT is expressed in PNMT-positive chromaffin cells we explored whether this pattern of expression is also present in the human adrenal medulla. While we successfully established that NAT and PNMT are co localised, we also found that all human adrenal chromaffin cells are PNMT-positive. In the rat, NAT is also observed within the cytoplasm and has been suggested to be associated with secretory vesicles, thus using the secretory vesicle marker, CGA, we demonstrate that NAT is associated with secretory vesicles. However, in contrast to our findings within the normal chromaffin cells, in situ NAT expression in human phaeochromocytoma tumour samples was distorted, with observed changes including the level and type of staining observed, and disruptions to the strict NAT-CGA association observed in the normal adrenal.
 
 Continuing our theme of NAT, we investigated if pre treating the phaeochromocytoma PC12 cell line with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin had an effect on the expression of NAT, to give an indication of the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of metastatic phaeochromocytoma with radiolabelled 131Iodometabenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG), a noradrenaline analogue which can be incorporated into phaeochromocytoma tumour cells though uptake through NAT. The premise of this study is derived from previous work in which neuroblastoma cells pre-treated with cisplatin were more responsive to (131I-MIBG) accumulation due to increased activity and expression of the transporter. Thus we treated PC12 cells for 24-hours in a range of cisplatin concentrations and measured the effect on NAT expression. However, unlike the findings in neuroblastoma cells, in our study, we did not observe an effect of cisplatin pretreatment on NAT activity or expression in PC12 cells.
 
 Upto 30% of phaeochromocytoma arise as apart of a hereditary syndrome. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, due to germline mutations to the VHL gene, and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), due to germline mutations to the RET gene represent two examples of hereditable endocrine disorders where phaeochromocytoma is a presenting feature. Notable differences in clinical presentation and tumour biology have been identified in phaeochromocytomas from patients with VHL and MEN 2. These differences prompted us to explore whether these observations extend to the chromaffin granule constituents, NPY and CGA.
 
 Patients with MEN 2 disease have a greater incidence of hypertension than patients with VHL disease, MEN 2 are characterised by an adrenergic phenotype (produce predominantly-adrenaline), whereas VHL phaeochromocytomas are noradrenergic (produce predominantly-noradrenaline). Neuropeptide Y, which has powerful vasoactive properties capable of significantly elevating blood pressure, is stored and released with catecholamines and is thought to be associated with PNMT-positive chromaffin cells. Thus, we questioned whether the differences in the symptomatology between VHL and MEN 2 patients may be related to differences in NPY expression between the two groups, and whether any differences in NPY relate to adrenaline and/or PNMT content, or are linked to hereditary factors. Thus we compared tumour samples from four cohorts of patients: (i) adrenergic versus noradrenergic phenotype, (ii) hereditary versus no hereditary syndrome. Results demonstrated that although tumour NPY levels (mRNA and peptide) correlate with PNMT expression and/or adrenaline content, when NPY expression was compared between groups of patients (adrenergic vs noradrenergic; hereditary versus nonhereditary) difference in NPY levels were only significant between VHL and MEN 2 tumour and not between sporadic adrenergic and noradrenergic Immunohistochemistry also supported the above observations. Hence, we concluded that NPY expression in all groups of phaeochromocytoma examined in this study, this effect is not related to tumour biochemical phenotype but rather appears to be a specific unique trait of VHL phaeochromocytomas.
 
 Continuing our theme of the possible differential expression of chromaffin granule constituents between VHL and MEN 2 patients, we also investigated CGA levels in plasma and tumour samples. Given, VHL tumours possess less chromaffin granules than MEN 2 tumours, and CGA has been implicated as a key director of secretory vesicle biogenesis we investigated whether CGA was differentially expressed between VHL and MEN 2 tumours. We found CGA expression was significantly greater in MEN 2 tumours (mRNA; 3-fold, and protein; 20-fold), with western blot confirming this trend. We also found that plasma CGA was greater in MEN 2 patients but not significantly, consequently, we explored the co-variables tumour size and tumour secretory activity (measured by plasma catecholamine concentrations), which influence plasma CGA and found that tumour size and plasma CGA are related but there was no influence of genotype on this relationship. In contrast, plasma CGA was significantly related to tumour secretory activity and the effect of genotype on this relationship narrowly missed significance, but when we expressed plasma CGA as a ratio of plasma catecholamines, plasma CGA was 2-fold greater in MEN 2 patients than VHL patients. Thus despite the tendency of phaeochromocytomas from VHL disease to readily and continuously release their catecholamine stores, plasma CGA levels still appeared to be higher in MEN 2 patients.
 
 Finally, we examined whether the expression of NPY, Leu- enkephalin (Leu-Enk), NAT and the vesicular monoamine transporters type 1 and 2 (VMAT1 and VMAT2,), in normal mouse adrenal glands, and in histologically-confirmed adrenal phaeochromocytomas generated by injected nude mice with a phaeochromocytoma (MPC) cells line. The results of this study established that similar to the rat and human NAT expression is preferentially localised with PNMT within mouse chromaffin cells, while VMAT1 and NPY are found in both PNMT-negative and PNMT-positive cell populations, although expression of NPY was reduced in PNMT-negative cells. In contrast, both VMAT2 and Leu-Enk were found in PNMT-negative noradrenergic cells, and VMAT2 was present in all noradrenergic chromaffin cells while Leu-Enk was observed in a subpopulation of noradrenergic chromaffin cells. In contrast to the normal adrenal but similar to our findings in human phaeochromocytoma, the pattern of marker expression within adrenal phaeochromocytoma lesions of MPC-injected mice are severely disrupted related to both the level of expression of the respective markers, and association with PNMT within the tissue. Thus, the experimentally generated phaeochromocytoma mouse model provides a valuable tool in studying human phaeochromocytoma.
 
 The data presented in this thesis further validate the heterogeneity observed in many aspects of phaeochromocytoma tumour biology, including the expression several chromaffin cell markers such as NAT, NPY and CGA. The altered expression of these markers may contribute to the clinical picture of these tumours, particularly relating to hereditary phaeochromocytoma from VHL and MEN 2 disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/659/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban rail perspectives in Perth, Western Australia: modal competition, public transport, and government policy in Perth since 1880</field><field name="creator">Cole, Peter</field><field name="description">The decline of public transport in Western Australia is observed in four separate historical studies which narrate the political and administrative history of each major urban transport mode. Perth's suburban railway system is examined as part of the State's widespread rail network, including the extravagantly-equipped short-lived suburban railway in Kalgoorlie. Political interference in early railway operations is studied in detail to determine why Perth's rail-based public transport systems were so poorly developed and then neglected or abandoned for much of the twentieth century. The llnique events in Kalgoorlie at the turn of the century are presented as potent reasons for the early closure of Perth's urban tramway system and the fact that no purpose-built suburban railways were constructed in Perth until 1993. The road funding arrangements of the late nineteenth century are considered next, in order to demonstrate the very early basis for the present lavish non-repayable grants of money for road construction and maintenance by all three layers of government. The development of private and government bus networks is detailed last, with particular attention paid to the failure of private urban bus operators in the 1950s and the subsequent formation of a government owned and operated urban bus monopoly. The capital structure and accounting practices of public transport modes are analysed to provide a critique of popular myths concerning the merits of each. In order to obtain an impression of the changing political view of different transport modes, the attitude of politicians to public transport and the private motor car over the last one hundred and twenty years is captured in summary narrations of some of the more important parliamentary transport debates. Two possible explanations of public transport decline are discussed in conclusion; one relying a neoclassical economic theory of marginal pricing, and the other on an observation on the fate of large capital investments in the modern party-based democratic system of government.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/660/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving rehabilitation practices for the outer batter slopes of bauxite residue disposal areas at Worsley refinery, Collie, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Collins, Shane Michael</field><field name="description">Control of water erosion of soil at mine sites requires an ability to predict the effects of different management practices on soil loss. Using soil loss models such as the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) requires calibration of the model for materials and situations that are not defined in the model's handbook or software.
 
 The outer slopes of bauxite residue disposal areas are potentially highly erodible surfaces, and a recent evaluation of previous rehabilitation practices at Worsley Alumina, Collie, Western Australia, identified areas on the bauxite residue disposal areas where vegetation establishment and management of long term soil loss could be improved. Field experiments commencing in April 2000 at Worsley Alumina's bauxite refinery, Collie, and laboratory tilting flume experiments run at the University of Queensland, were designed to quantify the effectiveness of different surface treatments on reducing short-term soil loss, and to model long-term erosion risks.
 
 Crushed ferricrete caprock - rock-pitch - and different types of mulches, seed mixes and fertiliser rates were applied to the compacted clay batter slopes used to contain bauxite residue, with runoff, soil loss and vegetation establishment monitored periodically over 27 months. Laboratory tilting flume results were related to the field data using the soil erosion models MINErosion, the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and RUSLE to predict event-based and annual soil loss for different treatments.
 
 Turbo-mulch, a blocky, coarse pine bark, was the most effective surface treatment for promoting vegetation establishment, reducing rill formation and reducing soil loss, a result supported in both the field and laboratory results. Turbo-mulch and vegetation did not reduce runoff, but resulted in decreased soil loss. This shows the importance of protecting soil from raindrop impact and of the soil holding capacity of vegetation. Increased seed and fertiliser rates did not significantly affect native plant numbers or foliage cover on topsoil without turbo-mulch. Rock-pitch was found to be resistant to erosion and mass movement along a rock-pitch/compacted clay interface. Field erosion measurements ranged from 0.87 t/ha/yr for turbo-mulched treatments to 7.41 t/ha/yr for a treatment with a different seed mix, lacking turbo-mulch and lacking underlying rock-pitch. RUSLE soil loss predictions based on soil properties and soil loss estimates from the MINErosion model ranged from 0.27 to 60.0 t/ha/yr. RUSLE predictions based on tilting flume data ranged from 0.14 to 81.1 t/ha/yr. RUSLE overpredicted soil loss for treatments without turbo-mulch, and underestimated soil loss for turbo-mulched treatments, necessitating calibration based on the unique materials trialed in this study.
 
 The relative soil loss measured in the field was best represented by RUSLE predictions based on tilting flume data rather than the MINErosion model. MINErosion did not adequately describe the effect of bulk density and infiltration on soil loss of compacted/consolidated materials. MUSLE and RUSLE are adequate models for the Western Australian conditions of this study, but further research is required to calibrate the C factor for turbo-mulched surfaces and calibrate the P factor for rock-pitch.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/661/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular markers, analysis and the population genetics of parasites</field><field name="creator">Constantine, Clare</field><field name="description">In this study different molecular techniques are contrasted (RAPD's, allozyme, sequencing mtDNA, sequencing ribosomal spacers) and appropriate analytical methods (allelic and infinite-sites approaches; inbreeding and coalescent models) used for estimating population genetic parameters in parasites. A range of population genetic questions at different scales were chosen to emphasise the importance of tailoring techniques and analytical methods to the particular question being investigated.
 
 The realisation that each question formulated has a particular scale means the appropriate technique and markers must be useful at that scale to attempt to answer the question. The useful scale of a technique depends several factors including the region of DNA examined, the density of sampling of the technique, and the mode of evolution of the markers. Each technique will produce a useful range of variability. Below the lower limit there is no variation, above the upper limit the variation is too high to produce useful comparisons.
 
 Parasites are of interest for many reasons, primarily because they can cause disease and thus impact on their host's population dynamics. They are often closely associated with their hosts and may undergo co-evolution, as well as causing an ongoing immunological "arms race" with their hosts. The parasitic mode of live is found throughout nearly all taxonomic groupings and thus classical models of population genetics based on sexual, diploid vertebrates do not fit well with the entire diversity of parasite groups.
 
 Genetic diversity within and among populations of Echinococcus granulosus was examined contrasting a RAPD dataset with an allozyme dataset. Two models of variation in Echinococcus have been proposed, those of Smyth and Rausch, and the expected genetic structure from each was compared to the observed genetic structure. The premise of Smyth's model, predominant self-fertilisation, was supported, but the resultant pattern of genetic variation followed Rausch's model.
 
 RAPD data, being dominant, present challenges to analysis. An approach to overcome this dominance problem and allow standard allelic frequency analysis is described using the selfing rate estimated from allozyme data. The RAPD data were also analysed using both band-sharing and nucleotide diversity approaches.
 
 A population genetic study of Ostertagia ostertagi in the USA was extended to two different scales: within an Australian state and between the USA and Australian continents. Three alternative explanations for the observed discrepancy between genetic structure and differentiation in an important biological trait, hypobiosis, were explored. A number of programs and analyses were compared including coalescent geneflow estimates.
 
 Variation among multiple copies of two spacer regions of rDNA was examined within individuals of Ostertagia ostertagi. Both the intergenic spacer and internal transcribed spacer 1 regions were found to include repeat regions, with different numbers of repeats creating length differences in clones from the same worm. Multi-copy genes present extra challenges in analysis to ensure that only homologous copies are being compared. Many studies fail to look for variation within populations or within individuals.
 
 The two major conclusions from these examples are that:
 
 1). The study of variation necessarily involves an implicit scale, and markers must be chosen that are appropriate to the question being explored.
 
 2). Using several methods of analysis of genetic data allows contrasts to be made, and if different methods produce similar results gives much more confidence in the conclusions drawn. Incongruence in results leads to new questions and reexamination of the assumptions of each analysis.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/662/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crazy, sad or just different: evolving representations of mental illness and the mentally ill during psychology education</field><field name="creator">Correia, Helen Mary</field><field name="description">Mental illness is an issue of concern to the general community, and is a major focus of professions such as psychology. Such professions demand extensive education and training, with the aim to develop a scientific understanding of mental illness that is portrayed in contrast to socially shared knowledge, or social representations. However, some aspects of these social representations may persist in conjunction with the development of scientific knowledge. The current study used a multimethodological approach to elucidate how such social representations may be transformed or modified by relevant education in psychology.
 
 Psychology students, non-psychology students and clinical psychologists participated in the current study to assess groups at different levels of psychology education and training. Four forms of data collection were used as part of a multimethodological approach. Intra-individual methods focused on the use of repertory grids and word associations to explore responses to the mentally ill as well as other relevant individuals such as the physically ill and mental health professionals. Inter-individual methods focused on social interaction in response to a case vignette of an individual with a mental disorder and group discussion within the educational setting.
 
 Several core themes described in previous research were identified consistently across different groups and different methodologies. Negative emotion, such as distress and sadness, impaired functioning, and the need for assistance were commonly used as indicators of mental health problems. One of the most prominent themes, however, was the notion of difference and distance. The mentally ill person was consistently differentiated, particularly from the self, even when the label of mentally ill was not imposed. The importance of the self was especially evident, acting as a means to define normality and difference.
 
 Several differences were also noticeable between different levels of education. A changing representation was evident from understandings of the mentally ill as crazy, viewed in a more stereotypical, negative and critical light, to representations of the mentally ill as sad, typified by greater sympathy. Social representations may therefore influence the social response to the mentally ill. Increasing education associated with scientific understandings was also characterised by exclusive technical discourse, a feature that may distance the psychologist from the general community.
 
 These findings are particularly relevant to how education affects social representations of mental illness and the mentally ill, as public campaigns seek to change community attitudes and understandings. In addition, there are particular implications for psychologists, in training or at work. While a primary goal for the psychologist is to empathise and connect with the individuals they are intending to assist, the emphasis on difference, in both social and scientific understandings of the mentally ill, may act as a barrier. The education and professional development of psychologists should incorporate an understanding of how such representations may influence professional practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/663/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of Scleroderma spore inoculum for Eucalyptus nurseries in China</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yinglong</field><field name="description">Scleroderma, a genus of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, is often associated with trees in disturbed habitats and is therefore considered to be suitable for use in plantation forestry. This study investigated aspects of Scleroderma and its mycorrhizas with the view to its future use in plantation forestry in south China. Spores were chosen as inoculum as they are preferred by nursery managers in south China, due to the lack of on-site fermentation and storage facilities.
 
 To determine the need for inoculation, Eucalyptus plantations in south China were sampled for sporocarps and mycorrhizas over two years. This study revealed a low diversity of ECM fungi consisting of 15 taxa fruiting beneath Eucalyptus plantations. The most common genera were Scleroderma and Pisolithus, but they were infrequent and the extent of root colonization was poor. Bioassay trials with E. urophylla as a bait host, using soils collected from 8 eucalypt plantations, confirmed low levels of inoculum in field soil. It was concluded that introduction of suitable ECM symbionts into eucalypt nurseries in south China is desirable in the future. As the Scleroderma genus has not been well studied in Australasia or SE Asia, over 140 collections gathered mainly from eucalypt plantations in south China and south-western Australia were described using sporocarp and spore morphology.
 
 Twelve Scleroderma taxa were recognized from collections made from under eucalypt plantations in south-western Australia and 6 of these were collected from under eucalypt plantations in south China. In conjunction with classical taxonomy, 30 collections, including those used in inoculation trials, were further characterized by phylogenetic analyses of ITS or LSU rDNA sequences. These studies supported classical delineation of some Scleroderma species but not all. Although a limited number of collections were amplified, phylogenetic results showed that most collections in this study were distinct from the European and Malaysian taxa extracted from GenBank (89% bootstrap support for both LSU and ITS regions). In order to optimise spore germination and root colonization, two glasshouse trials were established to examine suitable spore density and spore storage conditions on E. globulus and E. urophylla. A spore density of 105 spores seedling-1 was identified as a suitable dose for promoting root colonization. Spores stored for 5 years at low temperate (4 0C) were almost as effective as freshly collected spores in forming mycorrhizas.
 
 As the compatibility of Scleroderma fungi with plantation trees is unknown, a glasshouse experiment examined the ability of 15 collections of Scleroderma to form mycorrhizas with seedlings of six plantation trees (Acacia mangium, A. mearnsii, E. globulus, E. urophylla, Pinus elliottii and P. radiata) in a nursery potting mix. Most collections were able to aggressively colonize eucalypts and pines, while roots of acacias were poorly colonized. As the Australian collections were more effective in colonizing short roots on eucalypts than the Chinese collections, it was concluded Scleroderma should be sourced from outside China for inoculating eucalypts in Chinese nurseries.
 
 To optimize nursery practices to meet the demand for high quality seedlings and clonal lines of E. urophylla and hybrids, for outplanting in south China, effects of rooting medium and inoculation with 6 Scleroderma collections on the growth of E. urophylla were examined in a nursery in south China. Four types of soil taken from eucalypt plantations in south China were compared to a potting mix composed of vermiculite, peat and sand. The inoculant Scleroderma fungi were able to out-compete indigenous mycorrhizal fungi in the rooting media. However, the potting mix was superior to soils both for plant growth and ECM development under nursery conditions.
 
 This research should facilitate the use of Scleroderma spores in eucalypt nurseries in south China. Spore orchards could be set up in China using Australian Scleroderma spp. from under eucalypts. Spores could be stored dry at 4 0C until they are required for inoculation in potting mixes in containerized nurseries. However, before commercial application, further work on persistence of Scleroderma in the nursery and field, and responses of trees in the field to inoculation, needs to be undertaken.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/665/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent content-based image retrieval framework based on semi-automated learning and historic profiles</field><field name="creator">Chung, Kien- Ping</field><field name="description">Over the last decade, storage of non text-based data in databases has become an increasingly important trend in information management. Image in particular, has been gaining popularity as an alternative, and sometimes more viable, option for information storage. While this presents a wealth of information, it also creates a great problem in retrieving appropriate and relevant information during searching. This has resulted in an enormous growth of interest, and much active research, into the extraction of relevant information from non text-based databases. In particular,content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems have been one of the most active areas of research.
 
 The retrieval principle of CBIR systems is based on visual features such as colour, texture, and shape or the semantic meaning of the images. To enhance the retrieval speed, most CBIR systems pre-process the images stored in the database. This is because feature extraction algorithms are often computationally expensive. If images are to be retrieved from the World-Wide-Web (WWW), the raw images have to be downloaded and processed in real time. In this case, the feature extraction speed becomes crucial. Ideally, systems should only use those feature extraction algorithms that are most suited for analysing the visual features that capture the common relationship between the images in hand. In this thesis, a statistical discriminant analysis based feature selection framework is proposed. Such a framework is able to select the most appropriate visual feature extraction algorithms by using relevance feedback only on the user labelled samples. The idea is that a smaller image sample group is used to analyse the appropriateness of each visual feature, and only the selected features will be used for image comparison and ranking. As the number of features is less, an improvement in the speed of retrieval is achieved. From experimental results, it is found that the retrieval accuracy for small sample data has also improved. Intelligent E-Business has been used as a case study in this thesis to demonstrate the potential of the framework in the application of image retrieval system.
 
 In addition, an inter-query framework has been proposed in this thesis. This framework is also based on the statistical discriminant analysis technique. A common approach in inter-query for a CBIR system is to apply the term-document approach. This is done by treating each image's name or address as a term, and the query session as a document. However, scalability becomes an issue with this technique as the number of stored queries increases. Moreover, this approach is not appropriate for a dynamic image database environment. In this thesis, the proposed inter-query framework uses a cluster approach to capture the visual properties common to the previously stored queries. Thus, it is not necessary to 'memorise' the name or address of the images. In order to manage the size of the user's profile, the proposed framework also introduces a merging approach to combine clusters that are close-by and similar in their characteristics. Experiments have shown that the proposed framework has outperformed the short term learning approach. It also has the advantage that it eliminates the burden of the complex database maintenance strategies required in the term-document approach commonly needed by the interquery learning framework. Lastly, the proposed inter-query learning framework has been further extended by the incorporation of a new semantic structure. The semantic structure is used to connect the previous queries both visually and semantically. This structure provides the system with the ability to retrieve images that are semantically similar and yet visually different. To do this, an active learning strategy has been incorporated for exploring the structure.

Gold and silver colloids have characteristic absorption peaks at 530 nm and 620 nm respectively. Thus, the extent of gold or silver dissolution in different lixiviant systems was monitored using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. A comparison of the behaviour of gold colloids and powders has also been made. The beneficial or detrimental effects of silver colloid, and background reagents such as silver nitrate, and sodium salts of nitrate, carbonate, sulfite, sulfate, trithionate, tetrathionate anions have also been investigated.
 
 Experimental results show that the relative rates and the extent of gold colloid dissolution at 25&#186;C in different lixiviant systems in a given time interval are in the order: oxygen-cyanide &gt; copper(II)-ammonia-thiosulfate &#8776; oxygen-copper(II)- ammonia-thiosulfate &gt; oxygen ammonia-thiosulfate &#8805; oxygen-ammonia &gt; copper(II) ammonia. The analysis of electrode potentials shows that Au(S2O3)23- is the predominant gold(I) species in the lixiviant solutions containing oxygen or copper(II) as oxidant and thiosulfate or mixed ammonia-thiosulfate as ligands. During the reaction of copper(II) with thiosulfate in ammoniacal solution without oxygen, the measured potential using a platinum electrode represent the redox couple Cu(NH3)n2+/Cu(S2O3)m1-2m (n = 4 or 3, m = 3 or 2) depending on the concentrations of thiosulfate and ammonia.
 
 The initial dissolution rates of gold colloid by oxygen in copper-free solutions show a reaction order of 0.28 with respect to the concentration of dissolved oxygen, but independent of the concentration of ammonia and thiosulfate. The reaction activation energy of 25 kJ/mol in the temperature range 25&#176;C to 48&#176;C indicated a diffusion controlled reaction.
 
 The initial dissolution rates of gold colloid by oxidation with copper(II) in oxygenfree solutions show reaction orders of 0.41, 0.49, 0.60, 0.15 and 0.20 with respect to the concentrations of copper(II), thiosulfate, ammonia, chloride and silver respectively. The presence of silve (I) or chloride ions enhances the rate of gold dissolution, indicating their involvement in the surface reaction, possibly by interfering with or preventing a passivating sulfur rich film on gold surface. An activation energy of 40-50 kJ/mol for the dissolution of gold by oxidation with copper(II) in the temperature range 22&#176;C to 48&#176;C suggests a mixed chemically/diffusion controlled reaction. The dissolution of gold by oxidation with copper(II) in oxygen-free solutions appears to be a result of the reaction between gold, thiosulfate ions and the mixed complex Cu(NH3)p(S2O3)0. The half order reactions support electrochemical mechanisms in some cases.
 
 The initial dissolution rates of gold colloid, massive gold and gold-silver alloys by oxygenated copper(II) solutions also suggest a reaction that is first order with respect to copper(II) concentration. High oxygen concentration in solutions has a negative effect on the initial rate of gold dissolution and overall percentage of gold dissolution, indicating that oxygen affects the copper(II), copper(I) or sulfur species which in turn affects the gold dissolution. The surface reaction produces Au(NH3)(S2O3)- and Cu(NH3)p+. The mixed complexes Au(NH3)(S2O3)- and Cu(NH3)p+ re-equilibrate to the more stable complexes Au(S2O3)23- and Cu(S2O3)35- in solution.
 
 The dissolution of gold powder by oxidation with copper(II) in oxygen-free solutions shows the same trends as that of gold colloid. The presence of silver(I) or chloride ions enhances the initial rate and percentage dissolution of gold colloid and powder. The dissolution kinetics of gold powder and colloid follow a shrinking sphere kinetic model in solutions of relatively low concentrations of thiosulfate and ammonia, with apparent rate constants being inversely proportional to particle radius.
 
 The best system for dissolving gold based on the results of this work is the copper(II)-ammonia-thiosulfate solution in the absence of oxygen or in the presence of oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, copper(II) 1.5-4.5 mM, thiosulfate 20-50 mM, ammonia 120-300 mM and pH 9.3-10 are the best conditions. The presences of carbonate and sulfite have a significant negative effect on the dissolution of gold. The presence of sodium trithionate shows a beneficial effect in the first two hours, while sodium tetrathionate or lead nitrate have a small negative effect and sodium nitrate showed no effect on the dissolution of gold. Silver nitrate and sodium chloride also show beneficial effects. In the presence of oxygen, copper(II) 2.0-3.0 mM, thiosulfate 50 mM, ammonia 240 mM and pH 9.3-9.5 are the best conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/672/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Papillomatosis and carcinomatosis in the western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville)</field><field name="creator">Woolford, Lucy</field><field name="description">Conservation efforts to prevent the extinction of the endangered western barred bandicoot Perameles bougainville (WBB) are currently hindered by a debilitating progressive papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Now extinct on mainland Australia, wild populations of the WBB are known only to exist on Bernier and Dorre Islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia. This thesis describes and analyses the pathological (gross, histological, ultrastructural) and immunohistochemical features of a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in the WBB. The detection and characterisation of a novel virus, the bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV1), found in association with cutaneous and muco-cutaneous papillomas and carcinomas, is described. BPCV1 was found to exhibit genomic and morphological features of both the Papillomaviridae and the Polyomaviridae, and may represent the first member of a new family of viruses. The findings of this study provide evidence that BPCV1 is the causative agent of the papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Clinical, pathological and molecular evidence of the syndrome and BPCV1 were found in the Bernier Island WBB population at Red Cliff and in captive populations comprising all or a proportion of founder WBBs from this site, but not at all in the WBB population on Dorre Island or Heirisson Prong. The papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in the western barred bandicoot is a pertinent example of a disease process hampering efforts to prevent the extinction of an endangered species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/673/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multistage and multiple biomass approaches to efficient biological nitrogen removal using biofilm cultures</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Leonie</field><field name="description">Nitrogen removal from wastewater is important for the revention of significant health and environmental impacts such as eutrophication. Nitrogen removal is achieved by the combined action of nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification is performed by autotrophic, slow growing microorganisms that require oxygen and are inhibited in the presence of denitrifiers when oxygen and COD are available due to competition for oxygen. Denitrification however, performed by relatively fast growing heterotrophic bacteria, is inhibited by oxygen and requires COD. This implies that nitrification and denitrification are mutually exclusive. The supply of oxygen to a fresh wastewater, high in ammonia and COD, causes waste of both oxygen and COD. Conservation of COD is therefore critical to efficient wastewater treatment. The approach investigated in this study to achieve complete nitrogen removal was to physically separate the nitrification and denitrification biomasses into separate bioreactors, supplying each with appropriate conditions for growth and activity.
 
 A storage driven denitrification sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SDDR) was established which exhibited a high level of COD storage (up to 80% of influent COD) as poly-B-hydroxybutyrate capable of removing &gt;99% of nitrogen from wastewaters with a C/N ratio of 4.7 kg COD/kg N&#8211;NO3 &#8211;. The SDDR was combined in sequential operation with a nitrification reactor to achieve complete nitrogen removal. The multiple stage, multiple biomass reactor was operated in sequence, with Phase 1 - COD storage in the storage driven denitrification biofilm; Phase 2 - ammonia oxidation in the nitrification reactor; and Phase 3 - nitrate reduction using the stored COD in the storage driven denitrification reactor. The overall rate of nitrogen removal observed was up to 1.1 mmole NH3 L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 and &gt;99% of nitrogen could be removed from wastewaters with a low C/N ratio of 3.9 kg COD/kg N&#8211;NH3.
 
 The multiple stage, multiple biomass system was limited in overall nitrogen removal the reduction in pH caused by nitrification. A parallel nitrification-denitrificatio (PND) reactor was developed in response to the pH control issue. The PND reactor was operated with Phase 1 &#8211; COD storage in the storage driven denitrification biofilm and Phase 2 &#8211; simultaneous circulation of reactor liquor between the denitrification and nitrification biofilms to achieve complete nitrogen removal and transfer of protons. The PND reactor performed competitively with the multistage reactor (removal of &gt;99% nitrogen from wastewaters with feed ratios of 3.4 kg COD/kg N&#8211;NH3) without the need for addition of buffering material to oderate the pH.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/674/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queer being and the sexual interstice: A phenomenological approach to the queer transformative self</field><field name="creator">Horncastle, Julia</field><field name="description">This thesis explores a notion of &#8220;queer being&#8221; in relation to a difficult yet creative articulation of queer self-consciousness. The difficulty of attempting to &#8220;particularise&#8221; self-consciousness is challenged and dismantled by proposing ways in which putatively exclusive esoteric knowledges of being can be exposed and expanded. This is achieved by justifying singular (queer) experience as it coincides with the disparities between subjectivity and objectivity, experience and existence. I argue that two key perspectives (those of interstitiality and self-transformativity) provide a basis whereby we can &#8220;force&#8221; a radical articulation of queer being-ness into general and contemporary philosophical discourses of being. In doing so, a particularised theory of intersubjective being emerges as a way to identify the complicity of ethics and ontology.
 
 &#8220;Queerness&#8221; in this thesis is especially articulated as an eccentricity or poetics of being, experienced at the juncture of diverse knowledge spaces. These include not only the threshold and radical spaces of sexuality and gender, but also the perceived limits of theories of being which allow us to formulate understandings of self-consciousness. This is evidenced through a critical analysis of feminist, queer, transgender, phenomenological and existential texts and/or practices, paying special regard to &#8220;everyday, real-life&#8221; experience. By using a combination of the &#8220;logic of the interstice&#8221;, genealogical methods, hermeneutical analysis and a deconstructionist theoretical approach, the thesis seeks out, and insists upon, ways to articulate and determine the possibility of a queer sensibility as both a practice of self-transformativity and a more broadly applicable knowledge heuristic.
 
 The thesis demonstrates that by increasing an awareness of a particular kind of self-transformative queer being-ness &#8211; one that embraces a critical ethics of being &#8211; the rich insights of queer experiences and knowledges can act as a valuable resource for reviewing the horizons of the ontology of the subject. It also suggests that particularising the term &#8220;queer&#8221; in relation to a complex theory of &#8220;sensibility&#8221; provides new depths for understanding, and practical ways to make use of, a queer theory of being.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/675/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of methods for detection and eradication of mouse parvovirus from a laboratory mouse colony</field><field name="creator">Filipovska-Naumovska, Emilija</field><field name="description">The mouse parvovirus designated MPV can infect laboratory mice and affect the humoral and cellular immune response of infected mice, reducing their value for biomedical and medical research. The development and maintenance of MPV-free mouse colonies for biomedical research is therefore essential and requires routine monitoring of the infection status of mice, using serological surveillance procedures.
 
 Recent experience in the Animal Resources Centre (ARC), a major supplier of mice to the medical research community in Australia, was that MPV infection was present but was not detectable with the serological tests that were then in routine use.
 
 This thesis reports the development of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of the MPV in the ARC mouse colonies, the genetic characteristics of the strain of MPV detected, the development of a recombinant virus protein that provided a suitable antigen for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a Western immunoblot (WIB) assay for the detection of MPV antibodies, and use of these various assays to determine aspects of the epidemiology and pathogenicity of the infection that were critical to the eradication of virus infection and future immunological surveillance to ensure the absence of infection.
 
 The recombinant protein produced as an antigen was a biotinylated fusion protein, a truncated capsid protein of the strain of MPV detected in the ARC, and was produced using the PinpointTM vector and with expression in Escherichia coli. The protein was produced as an insoluble intracellular product within inclusion bodies and was solubilised using urea and purified. The purified protein was utilised as an antigen for ELISA and the WIB assays to detect virus antibody in infected mice.
 
 The outbreak of MPV infection in the ARC was used as an unique opportunity for assessment of the seroprevalence of MPV-1 infection in a large laboratory mouse colony and to utilise this data to determine the sampling size needed to reliably detect MPV-1 infection within such large laboratory mouse colonies. An overall seroprevalence of 16.5% was detected using the developed serological tests, but considerable variation in prevalence was detected in different mouse strains.
 
 The response to MPV infection of 4 different but common strains of mice was determined as a basis for developing appropriate surveillance procedures and the selection of appropriate sentinel animals. The effect of infection of these strains at different ages was also investigated. Virus replication was detected in tissues of all the mice strains infected (outbred ARC(s) and inbred C57BL/6JArc, BALB/c and BALB/c-Foxn1nu/Arc) as juveniles and adults, with the exception of C57BL/6JArc inoculated as adults. However, while seroconversion in mice inoculated as juveniles and adults was detected in ARC(s) and C57BL/6JArc mice, it was not detected in BALB/c mice. The high rate of seroconversion to MPV, the early and prolonged development of an immune response, and the lack of age differences in their susceptibility indicated that ARC(s) mice would provide reliable sentinels for the detection of MPV.
 
 The genomic nucleotide sequence of the ARC strain, excluding the terminal palindromic regions and the predicted amino acid sequences of the non-structural and structural proteins was determined. This strain was very similar (98-99% nucleotide identity) to the previously described MPV strains MPV-1a, MPV-1b and MPV -1c. The similarity suggested there were unlikely to be significant antigenic differences in the proteins of the ARC strain and those strains of MPV reported previously.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/676/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology and prevalence of Cirolana hesperia and their effect on the Western Rocklobster Fishery</field><field name="creator">Winzer, Andrew Charles</field><field name="description">The current study had two overriding and inter-related aims. The first was to describe the biology of C. hesperia the dominant scavenging subtidal cirolanid found in temperate waters off the Perth metropolitan coastline and thereby extend our knowledge and test several hypotheses regarding the biology of scavenging crustaceans in general. The second was to use the biological information generated to develop fishing practices that reduce the amount of bait used by trap based fisheries without reducing the overall catch. Fulfilling the latter aim has the potential to greatly reduce some of the deleterious effects of fishing practices around the world.
 
 A survey was designed to determine whether the anecdotal evidence that commercial rocklobster fishers believe sea lice have a negative impact on the ratio of bait used to rocklobster landed was widespread across the fishery and, if so, whether they associated particular factors with increases or decreases in lice numbers. The response rate of over 40% was high for a survey of this type and had similar return rates across all zones of the fishery. Such a high return rate, in addition to the responses confirms that commercial fishers, regardless of zone, consider that sea lice have adverse effects on the ratio of bait used to rocklobster landed.
 
 The findings of the survey allowed the following conclusions to be drawn and hypotheses developed. Commercial fishers believe particular temporal and spatial factors are associated with increased numbers of sea lice predating on rocklobster baits. For example, fishing in depth ranges of 20 - 30 fathoms (40 &#8211; 60 metres) and greater, fishing on a sand bottom, fishing during the months of November, December, March and April, fishing during the full and new moons and lastly during periods of weak current and high water temperature were all felt to increase the number of sea lice scavenging on baits.
 
 Laboratory growth trials demonstrated significant differences in the mean body lengths of starved and fed manca and adult C. hesperia after three and seven months, respectively. Despite these findings, starved adult C. hesperia continued to moult and grow after approximately 300 days of fasting. The relatively short period of time before differences in starved and fed manca C. hesperia growth parameters arose is probably due to early life stages of cirolanids being more reliant on regular food sources than their adult counterparts. An increase in water temperature from 16 &#186;C to 24 &#186;C resulted in no significant increase in mean body length of manca C. hesperia. However, the mean inter-moult period of fed manca housed at 24 &#186;C was significantly lower (25-50%) than both the fed treatment group housed at 16 &#186;C and the starved treatment group within the first two months of the trial. This reduction in mean inter-moult period is indicative of an animal which is growing quickly as a result of increased metabolic rate albeit at reduced increments.
 
 The 24 hour activity rhythms of C. hesperia in shallow waters in the metropolitan zone of the Western Rocklobster Fishery were determined in order to identify those factors which modulate the emergence and/or swimming activity of this dominant scavenger. It was concluded that the presence of a circadian rhythm of spontaneous nocturnal activity induced by the end of the diurnal period of photo-inhibition,regardless of tidal regime or lunar cycle, is evident in adult C. hesperia. In contrast, circa-tidal rhythms of emergence centered around spring tides were found to exist in juvenile C. hesperia with similar mean numbers trapped across all sampling times (see Chapter 3, tables 3.4-3.8) with the exception of high water spring tides (HWS), which resulted in significantly greater mean numbers. It was concluded that mature cirolanids found off the Western Australian coastline adopt a strictly nocturnal and facultative necrophage mode of existence despite carrion generally being regarded as a much less crucial food resource in relatively shallow, productive, inshore waters. However, juvenile cirolanids found off the Western Australian coastline were recognised as relying on a more opportunistic scavenger mode of existence being active during both day and night. This perpetual foraging strategy employed in cirolanids at manca and juvenile stages is possibly due to the lack of the well developed chemosensory and or olfactory capabilities found in their adult stages. In addition to this reduced foraging efficiency, a smaller gut size combined with higher metabolic rates and lower assimilation efficiencies ensures their ongoing search for sustenance.
 
 Analyses of the number of C. hesperia collected during three years of trapping in C zone of the Western Rocklobster Fishery clearly demonstrated that the numbers of cirolanids caught in rocklobster pots were significantly affected by bottom type, moon phase and depth. With respect to bottom type, the greatest numbers of C. hesperia were trapped in rocklobster pots deployed on weed/rock and sand bottoms while significantly lower numbers of C. hesperia were trapped on rock or weed bottoms. In regards to moon phase, rocklobster pots deployed during the new and last quarter of the moon phase trapped significantly greater numbers of both C. hesperia and the Western Rocklobster, P. cygnus than those deployed during the full and first quarter phases. Rocklobster pots containing lice traps deployed in depths ranging from 10-19 and 20-29 fathoms (20-39 and 40-59 metres respectively) caught significantly greater numbers of C. hesperia and P. cygnus than pots deployed in the 1-19 metre depth range. Lastly, the catchability of both C. hesperia and P. cygnus was greatest when either Australian salmon or blue mackerel was deployed in pots indicating these scavengers do exercise a degree of selectivity with respect to particular bait types.
 
 Whilst ovigerous C. hesperia were present in each month of the year, peaks in their abundance and/or catchability occurred at the height of summer (January to March). These peaks in mpm, i.e. morphological parturial moult stage, C. hesperia were then followed by corresponding peaks in recruitment from April to June. I hypothesise that peaks in the reproductive intensity of C. hesperia can be attributed to peaks in water temperature and also the seasonal influx of carrion due to both recreational and commercial charter fishing and the commencement of the rocklobster season all occurring predominately within a similar time frame, i.e. the warmer months.
 
 The current study has clearly demonstrated that a plethora of factors attract high numbers of both C. hesperia and P. cygnus. Thus, it is apparent that those practices employed by commercial fishers to land the greatest number of P. cygnus will also attract significant numbers of C. hesperia to rocklobster baits. Irrespective of key factors driving C. hesperia abundance, the high market price received for P. cygnus in conjunction with the relatively low price payed for bait, ensures fishers will continue to deploy rocklobster pots in the manner which maximises their landings. Thus for a reduction in bait usage to offer significant economic savings to the industry, different methods of bait deployment that do not result in a decrease in the catch of P. cygnus must be developed.
 
 A series of baitsaver trials were conducted in order to determine whether baitsavers deployed containing reduced quantities of bait would catch the same numbers of rocklobster as conventional pots using the typical amounts of bait employed in the fishery. During the start of the season the majority of fishers concentrate their efforts in shallow waters and employ predominantly one day soaks as they target rocklobster migrating from the shallows to offshore habitats (whites phase &#8211; November to February). In the later parts of the season (reds phase &#8211; March to June) fishing effort becomes less concentrated as some fishers continue to fish the inshore grounds whilst others move out into deeper waters. The season long trial demonstrated that packing large quantities of bait in both baitboxes in the pot (traditional method) caught significantly more rocklobster than pots using a baitsaver in one bait box while the other bait box was packed in traditional fashion (combined method) during the first two months of the whites phase. However, during the remainder of the season there was no significant difference in catches between the two methods. Thus, the season-long trial found that the use of traditional methods of bait deployment in the first two months of the season in conjunction with the combined method of bait deployment from January until the end of the commercial season has the potential to save inshore and offshore based fishers $34,000 and $36,000 each year.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/678/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's experiences, social support and adapting to the offshore lifestyle: my life, my house, my bed..., not my life, shared house, shared bed, shared..., to get yourself back into sharing, because it takes a bit to work out the two</field><field name="creator">Watson, Jacinth Ann</field><field name="description">In the past two decades the growth of the offshore oil and gas industry of Western Australia has resulted in an increased number of families experiencing the intermittent absence of a partner/parent. The gendered nature of the offshore oil and gas industry means workers tend to be male and the partner left at home tends to be female. This was the case for the participants in this study. For two/three weeks the family experience the absence of the male 'breadwinner', creating a gap within the family as the women and children experiences the loss of the partner/parent. Two/three weeks later the male worker returns home for his rest period and he reengages in his roles and the family is reunited. When the worker is absent the partner at home takes on the worker's gendered roles, tasks and responsibilities; upon his return she surrenders (sometimes willingly) his gendered roles, tasks and responsibilities.
 
 Solheim (1988) state families of offshore oil and gas workers experience three social realities; his life at work, her 'single' life when he is at work, and their couple life when the worker arrives home. The families can develop a range of methods to adjust to the flux that occurs within families due to the work schedule (Forsyth and Gramling 1989). The repeated cyclical patterns of parting and reunion, weaving and balancing their three lives, and renegotiation of family work contribute to the stressors and strains the partners of offshore workers experience.
 
 This study investigated how the offshore lifestyle impacts the at home partner of offshore workers and in addition, how at home partners use their social networks as means to help adapt to the offshore work schedule, and makes two major findings. Firstly, the at home partners of offshore workers participate in exchanging, at various levels, social support with family, friends and neighbours, although the most important form of support which helps the at home partner adapt to the offshore lifestyle is the support they receive from the offshore worker. Secondly, adapting to the offshore lifestyle is highly influenced by a process consisting of four reactions. The reactions are: the beginning; normalising his presence; normalising his absence; and balancing two lives. The identification of the four reactions can provide a greater understanding of how the offshore oil and gas industry impacts on the daily lives of partners of offshore workers as it helps make visible the day-to-day lives of partners of offshore oil and gas workers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/679/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adult South Sudanese students in Australia: A systemic approach to the investigation of participation in cross-cultural learning</field><field name="creator">Turner, Marianne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores major influences on adult South Sudanese student participation in Australian learning environments. Between 2000 and 2006 Australia&#8217;s offshore humanitarian program accepted an increasing number of South Sudanese refugees (DIAC, 2007). Research related to this new group was minimal at the time of this study, and a theoretical framework was generated as a way of exploring the South Sudanese students&#8217; everyday participation in cross-cultural learning.
 
 The theoretical framework mainly draws on perspectives from sociocultural theory, cultural schema theory, research on expectations in cross-cultural learning, and sociological theories of agency. First, sociocultural perspectives provide a way of conceptualising students&#8217; participation in cross-cultural learning as &#8216;here and now&#8217; but significantly affected by engagement in past practices. The perspectives, with their focus on participation, also allow a conceptualisation of identity as situated in students&#8217; experience of themselves in specific practices. This notion of identity was used in the study to explore the extent to which students&#8217; past forms of participation were changed or negotiated. Next, research on expectations in cross-cultural learning and cultural schema theory offer a conceptualisation of how students&#8217; participation may have been affected by past experiences. In the study, cultural schemas were taken to underpin expectations shared by all of the students, and these cultural schemas were positioned as aspects of the students&#8217; identity. Finally, sociological theories of agency explore agency as co-regulated, transformative, and generating both intentional and unintentional outcomes. The dynamics of teacher-student and student-student interactions were taken to be a major influence on student participation, and these interactions were conceptualised as teacher-student agency. The theoretical framework is proposed to be systemic because the influence of students&#8217; past practices and the influence of current social interactions interrelate.
 
 The research was designed as an abductive study. Abduction, with its blend of induction and deduction, allows a &#8216;bottom up&#8217; approach where hypotheses are formed as much as possible from the data (Coffey and Atkinson, 1996). This approach allowed observation of everyday classroom practices, and then subsequent engagement with theory in order to interpret these practices. Ethnographic participant observation was used during initial data collection. Then further participant observation, a focus group and semi-structured interviews were used to investigate significant emerging themes. Over a nine month period, 36 students and 10 teachers were observed across three groups and learning environments: a women&#8217;s community group, a university group, and a technical college group. 25 students and 11 teachers were interviewed.
 
 The findings reveal that students had firm expectations in terms of displaying deference to the teacher, receiving very close monitoring from the teacher for both learning and behaviour, and competing against other students. The first expectation was found to apply across the learning environments, while the second two were found to apply only in formal learning environments. Teachers&#8217; expectations were found to vary according to the learning environment. When there was a lack of congruence between students&#8217; and teachers&#8217; expectations, students appeared to differ in their attachment to cultural schemas proposed to underlie their expectations. The findings also reveal that students had a strong cultural schema of interdependence which was negotiated differently depending on the student, and depending on the incentive provided by the learning environment. Furthermore, the findings reveal that teachers and students were able to modify teaching and learning practices to differing degrees according to the learning environments, and the opportunity to modify teaching and learning practices did not always lead to desired learning outcomes.
 
 This research provides insight into the everyday participation of adult South Sudanese students across different Australian learning environments. The relationship between students&#8217; past experiences and current social interactions with teachers and other students is highlighted through the systemic approach of the study. The research also provides a theoretical framework which may have applications in teacher education in the field of cross-cultural learning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/680/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The good student: subjectivities and power in secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Gregory</field><field name="description">Schooling has become one of the core, generalisable experiences of most young people in the Western world. This study examines the ways that students inhabit subjectivities in school through the normalising vision of the good student. The idea that schools exist to produce good students who become good citizens is one of the basic tenets of modernist educational philosophies that dominate the contemporary education world.
 
 This study takes a different position, arguing that the visions of the good student deployed in various ways in schools act to produce various ways of knowing the self that are ultimately concerned with behaviour and discipline rather than freer thought and action. Developing the postmodern theories of Foucault and Deleuze, this study argues that schools could be freer places than they are, but current practices act to teach students to know themselves in certain idealised ways through which they are located, and locate themselves, in hierarchical rationales of the good student.
 
 Part of the promise of schools lies in the ways that students become negotiators and producers of their subjectivities, albeit in narrow and limiting ways. By pushing the ontological understandings of the self beyond the modernist philosophies that currently dominate schools and schooling, this study problematises the ways that young people are made subjects in schools. Part of this modernist tradition is found in the institutional tendency to see students as fixed, measurable identities (beings) rather than dynamic, evolving performances (becomings).
 
 Schools and schooling largely appear to make sense to us because we think we understand what happens and what should happen in schools. The good student is framed within these aspects of cultural understanding. However, this commonsense attitude is based on a hegemonic understanding of the good, rather than the good student as a contingent multiplicity that is produced by an infinite set of discourses and experiences. I argue that this understanding of subjectivities and power is crucial if schools are to meet the needs of a rapidly changing and challenging world.
 
 This study utilises socially critical case study research across multiple sites to investigate those micropractices of power in schools that produce the normalising vision of the good student.

A key constraint to increasing the amount of N2 fixed in agricultural systems is the prevalence of symbioses which fix little or no N. The biotic factors leading to this suboptimal N2 fixation have not been extensively analysed. Using the widely studied and cultivated perennial legume Medicago sativa and the model indeterminate annual legume Medicago truncatula with the sequenced bacterial microsymbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 (Sm1021) as a basis, the work presented in this thesis examined the effectiveness of N2 fixation in these associations and in other comparable systems and investigated factors which lead to the establishment of suboptimally effective symbioses.
 
 The ability of Sm1021, S. medicae WSM419 and the uncharacterised Sinorhizobium sp. WSM1022 to fix N with M. truncatula A17, M. sativa cv. Sceptre and a range of other Medicago spp. was evaluated in N-limited conditions. As measured by plant shoot dry weights and N-content, Sm1021 was partially effective with M. truncatula A17 whereas WSM1022 and WSM419 were both effective with this host in comparison to nitrogen-fed (N-fed) control plants. In contrast, Sm1021 and WSM1022 were effective with M. sativa while WSM419 was only partially effective. Nodules induced by Sm1021 on M. truncatula A17 were more numerous, paler, smaller in size and more widely distributed over the entire root system than in the two effective symbioses with this host. On the contrary, nodule number, size and distribution did not differ between these three strains on M. sativa. WSM1022 was effective on M. littoralis, M. tornata and two other cultivars of M. truncatula (Jemalong and Caliph) but Sm1021 was only partially effective on these hosts. These data indicate that the model indeterminate legume symbiosis between M. truncatula and Sm1021 is not optimally matched for N2 fixation and that Sm1021 possesses broader symbiotic deficiencies. In addition, the interaction of WSM1022 with M. polymorpha (small white nodules but does not fix N), M. murex (does not nodulate), M. arabica (partially effective N2 fixation) and M. sphaeorcarpus (partially effective N2 fixation), and the sequence of the 16S rDNA, are all consistent with this isolate belonging to the species S. meliloti.
 
 The colony morphology of TY, half-LA and YMA agar plate cultures of Sm1021, WSM419 and WSM1022 suggested differences in EPS profiles between these strains. Sm1021 is very dry, compared to the mucoid WSM419 and extremely mucoid WSM1022. Sm1021 is known to carry an insertion in expR rendering the gene non-functional and resulting in the dry colony phenotype. WSM419 has an intact copy of expR, while the expR status of WSM1022 is not known. Rm8530, a spontaneous mucoid derivative of Sm1021 with an intact expR, was significantly less effective with M. truncatula than Sm1021, but there was no difference in effectiveness between these strains on M. sativa. The effectiveness of Sm1021, when complemented with a plasmid-borne copy of expR from Rm8530, was significantly reduced on M. truncatula but not M. sativa, implicating a functional expR as being the cause of reduced N2 fixation observed with Rm8530 on M. truncatula. ExpR could reduce the effectiveness of Rm8530 by acting as a negative regulator of genes essential for symbiosis with M. truncatula, or by altering the quantity or structure of succinoglycan and/or galactoglucan produced. These data support the emerging view of ExpR being a central regulator of numerous cellular processes.
 
 The timing of nodulation between Sm1021 and WSM419 on M. truncatula and M. sativa was investigated. Compared to the other symbioses analysed, the appearance of nodule initials and nodules was delayed when M. truncatula was inoculated with Sm1021 by 3 and 4 days, respectively. To explore whether events during early symbiotic signalling exchange could account for these observed delays, leading to the establishment of a suboptimal N2-fixing symbiosis, a novel system was developed to compare the response of the Sm1021 transcriptome to roots and root exudates of M. truncatula A17 and M. sativa cv. Sceptre. This system consisted of a sealed 1 L polycarbonate chamber containing a stainless steel tripod with a wire mesh platform on which surface-sterilised seeds could be placed and allowed to germinate through the mesh, into a hydroponic medium below. After germination, Sm1021 cells were inoculated into the hydroponic solution, exposed to the roots and root exudates for 16 h, harvested and their RNA extracted. Comparison of Sm1021 mRNA from systems exposed to M. truncatula or M. sativa revealed marked differences in gene expression between the two. Compared to the no plant control, when M. sativa was the host plant, 23 up-regulated and 40 down-regulated Sm1021 genes were detected, while 28 up-regulated and 45 down-regulated genes were detected with M. truncatula as the host. Of these, 12 were up-regulated and 28 were down-regulated independent of whether M. truncatula or M. sativa was the host. Genes expressed differently when exposed to either M. truncatula or M. sativa included nex18, exoK, rpoE1 and a number of other genes coding for either hypothetical proteins or proteins with putative functions including electron transporters and ABC transporters. Characterisation of these differentially expressed genes along with a better understanding of the composition of M. truncatula root exudates would yield a clearer insight into the contribution of early signal exchange to N2 fixation.
 
 Comparison of the regulation of nodule number between Sm1021 and WSM419 on M. truncatula and M. sativa revealed nodule initials at 42 days post-inoculation (dpi) on M. truncatula inoculated with Sm1021. In contrast, no new nodule initials were present 21 dpi on any of the other interactions examined. Moreover, analysis of nodule sections revealed that the number of infected cells in M. truncatula-Sm1021 nodules was less than for comparable symbioses. These data suggest that nodule number is not tightly controlled in the M. truncatula-Sm1021 association, probably due to N2 fixation being insufficient to trigger the down regulation of nodulation. Quantification of N2 fixation activity in this and other more effective symbioses is required. The poor effectiveness of the M. truncatula-Sm1021 symbiosis makes these organisms unsuitable as the model indeterminate interaction and the implications for legume research are discussed. The recently sequenced WSM419 strain, revealed here to fix N2 more effectively with M. truncatula than Sm1021, may be a better model microsymbiont, although WSM419 is only partially effective for N2 fixation with M. sativa. The sequencing of S. meliloti WSM1022, a highly effective strain with both M. truncatula and M. sativa, would provide a valuable resource in indentifying factors which preclude the establishment of effective symbioses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/683/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence, pathogenicity and control of avian intestinal spirochaetosis in Australia</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Carol Pauline</field><field name="description">Avian intestinal spirochaetosis (AIS) is a relatively recently recognized disease of commercial layer and meat breeder chickens resulting from colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by anaerobic spirochaetal bacteria of the genus Brachyspira. AIS is characterised by delayed and/or reduced egg production and chronic diarrhoea. This thesis describes an investigation into the prevalence, pathogenicity and control of species of avian intestinal spirochaete in Australia. Faeces samples from chickens in 22 flocks of laying hens, 19 broiler flocks and 28 breeder flocks in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia were subjected to selective anaerobic culture for Brachyspira species. Spirochaete isolates then were speciated using phenotypic characteristics and specific polymerase chain reaction amplifications. A highly significant association was found between colonisation with Brachyspira species and the occurrence of wet litter and/or reduced production in both broiler breeder and layer flocks in eastern Australia. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) then was used to help confirm the identity of the spirochaetes, and to examine their genetic relationships and disease associations. MLEE divided the isolates into five known Brachyspira species groups: Brachyspira murdochii, B. intermedia, B. pilosicoli, B. innocens, and &#8220;B. pulli&#8221;. Three new MLEE groups each containing single isolates were also identified. All farms with production problems or wet litter were colonised with the pathogenic species, B. intermedia and/or B. pilosicoli. The pathogenic potential of single isolates of B. pilosicoli and B. innocens then were experimentally evaluated in adult broiler breeders, confirming that infection with B. pilosicoli can result in serious egg production losses, whilst B. innocens is non-pathogenic. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the pathogenic spirochaetes B. pilosicoli and B. intermedia were both susceptible to tiamulin, lincomycin, metronidazole and tetracycline, while a lack of susceptibility to tylosin was found in some isolates of B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli. Some isolates of B. pilosicoli were not susceptible to ampicillin. Additional studies showed that zinc bacitracin, a common feed additive, can increase susceptibility to colonisation with B. pilosicoli. Both tiamulin and lincomycin were shown to be effective in treating infection with B. pilosicoli in adult birds.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/685/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turning road (Fiction) Bluebeard in Shirley Hazzard's the transit of Venus (Critical Accompaniment)</field><field name="creator">Stein, Tristan</field><field name="description">This is a thesis comprising two components: a portion of my novella and a dissertation. My work of fiction, Turning Road, draws loosely on the Bluebeard fairytale, as well as theories of identity and nation, as a means of exploring a young Australian woman&#8217;s journey to London, a journey which is both symbolic and psychological.
 
 The second component is the critical essay, which considers the extent to which Australian women&#8217;s expatriate fiction can be read as a variation of Bluebeard. Australian women&#8217;s expatriate fiction has been characterised as a journey involving a doomed love affair with a self-centred male in London.1 To date, most critical attention on the genre has focussed on the extent to which it employs the Odyssean myth to consider gender and colonial identity. It is my contention that reading Bluebeard in The Transit of Venus highlights issues of identity and power in relation to gender and nation. Through its central themes of threat, sexuality, secrecy, self-knowledge and seriality, Bluebeard warns against prescribed gender roles/relations and limiting identifications, and works towards depicting a new liberating space between contrasting spaces identified as home and abroad.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/686/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Chronicler's Genealogies:Towards an Understanding of 1 Chronicles 1-9</field><field name="creator">Sparks, James Thomas</field><field name="description">The genealogies of 1 Chronicles 1-9 have typically been viewed as the work of a redactor or redactors with no internal consistency, purpose or plan, and little, if any, relation to the narrative portions of Chronicles.
 
 In contrast to these opinions, this study shows that the genealogical section of the Chronicler's work is an ordered, well structured, unified whole. The Chronicler presents his genealogies chiastically, with the central focus of the chiasm upon the proper cultic officials, performing the proper cultic duties, in the proper cultic place.
 
 Each of the supporting levels of the chiasm build to this climax by declaring the inability of kings and armies to maintain the people within their land. The genealogies indicate that, in spite of the best efforts of leaders or people, society is sent into exile because of the unfaithfulness of the people and their leaders.
 
 The genealogies also declare the way out of exile. Humility and prayer are shown to bring blessing, prosperity and land, while periods of mourning over unfaithful behaviour results in the blessings of children and the building of cities. In the centre of it all is the cult. The cult is the means by which atonement is made for past acts of unfaithfulness, and without the cult, atonement for unfaithfulness is impossible.
 
 The genealogies indicate that the cult must be at the centre of the lives of the people. It cannot be neglected, but must be fully maintained and supported. Each of the cultic guilds must be present for the cult to function properly. Each guild must perform its function, and must do so in the place authorised by Yahweh. Only then can atonement for the people be made, and only then can the people possess their land.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/687/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of tools to improve the detection of Trypanosoma evansi in Australia</field><field name="creator">Smuts, Celia</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to evaluate new methods to improve detection and investigation of the effects of chronic or subclinical infection with Trypanosoma evansi in various mammalian species. Some of the more resistant host species, including pigs and buffaloes, are present in large feral populations in the northern parts of Australia, the area where T. evansi is most likely to gain entry to the country. Existing tests are not sufficiently reliable to detect all cases of disease and they cannot distinguish acute from chronic infections. Furthermore, the tests have different sensitivities in different host species.
 
 Surveillance for trypanosomiasis in Australia is problematic because of the need to work in remote parts of northern Australia where provision of a cold-chain for traditional blood and serum storage is difficult. An existing dried blood storage system was modified by treating cotton lint filter paper (Whatman #903) with a commercial post coating buffer (TropBio, Queensland). This treatment increased the longevity of antibodies to T. evansi in serum and blood stored on the paper (detected using an antibody-detection ELISA) compared to samples stored on plain paper, especially when the papers were stored under humid conditions and at high ambient temperatures.
 
 Attempts were made to improve the diagnostic utility and repeatability of antibody-ELISAs through the use of 2 recombinant T. brucei antigens (PFRA and GM6) and to optimize a competitive ELISA using RoTat 1.2 variable surface antigen and its monoclonal antibody. Antibody-detection using the two recombinant proteins was not sufficiently specific to enable their use for the detection of T. evansi. The RoTat 1.2 cELISA had good sensitivity and specificity (75% and 98% respectively) when used to test serum from cattle and buffaloes experimentally infected with T. evansi and uninfected animals. However, the test was not able to detect anti-T. evansi antibodies in serum from wallabies, pigs, a dog or a horse that were experimentally infected with T. evansi. The inability of the cELISA to detect anti-T. evansi antibodies may be due to the small number of samples tested or the lack of RoTat 1.2 specific antibodies in the animals tested.
 
 The feasibility of using an enzymatic test to detect trypanosome aminotransferase or antibodies to this enzyme was evaluated. Prior publications suggested that the detection of TAT was an appropriate diagnostic tool for the detection of T. evansi infection in camels. However, the results from this study did not support the use of this test for the detection of T. evansi infection in cattle or buffaloes with low to moderate parasitaemia.
 
 Trypanosomiasis is an immunological disease that affects most of the body&#8217;s organs, with more severe disease developing over time. Attempts were made to determine key cytokine and biochemical patterns that would distinguish infected from uninfected animals and acute from chronic infections. The results from this study showed that there was no specific pattern in serum cytokines or serum biochemistry that could be used to distinguish infected from uninfected animals, or different stages of disease.
 
 Immunohistochemistry was used on tissues from buffaloes and mice experimentally infected with T. evansi and T. brucei gambiense respectively to characterise the cellular immune response that was present. The immune response was predominantly cell mediated, with CD3+ T lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration occurring in most tissues. In end stage disease there was often suppression of the immune system with disruption of the architecture of the spleen and a decrease in B lymphocytes in the circulation.
 
 Trypanosomes were rarely visible in the tissues and were only seen in those animals with high parasitaemia. Lesions generally became more severe over time, but there was a large variation between animals, which suggests that immunohistochemistry is unsuitable as a diagnostic tool.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/688/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Periodic forcing of surface water-groundwater interaction: modelling in vertical section</field><field name="creator">Smith, Anthony John</field><field name="description">Sinusoidal variations in recharge can induce cyclical flows in surface water and groundwater. In this thesis, such time-dependent flows are explored in a coupled lakeaquifer system. The modelling extends previous steady state results and introduces new flow-visualisation techniques. Local responses in a 2D vertical section are illustrated for lakes within a 1D regional groundwater mound. The theory employs complex variables to decouple the periodic groundwater flows into separate steady state and fluctuating components.
 
 The time dependent behaviour causes the lake-aquifer flow to change between flowthrough, recharge and discharge regimes. Corresponding fluctuations between inflow and outflow across the lakebed allow interchange of lake water with the aquifer (recycling and recapture). This also gives rise to sinuous flowpaths that can result in apparent dispersion; the number and size of waves, cusps and loops is characterised by a nondimensional waviness ratio. Streakline plots are introduced and provide an intuitive impression of the time-dependent groundwater motion. Such plots are enhanced by animation and illustrate the complex and potentially dispersive nature of the flows.
 
 Interplay between the steady state and fluctuating responses determines the type and strength of flow regime transition. Importantly, there is an inverse relationship between head and flow in the fluctuating response. This is characterised by a dimensionless response time; a function of the aquifer geometry, hydraulic properties and period of fluctuation. During fast response, the recharge propagates mainly as fluctuation in flow, with small phase lags; particle trajectories form elliptical paths in the visualised flows. With a slower aquifer response, variation in recharge is manifest mostly as fluctuation in water level; cyclical perturbations in the flows are small and flows are nearly in steady state.
 
 The position of a lake within the regional setting, size of the lake, and ratio of lake to aquifer recharge are important to the steady state response. Flow-through regimes occur throughout the regional setting, but dominate when the lake is lower in the system and groundwater flow is greater. Discharge and recharge regimes occur higher in the flow system, when the ratio of lake to aquifer recharge is large in magnitude.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/689/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the lives of casual TAFE lecturers in metropolitan Perth</field><field name="creator">Shorne, Priscilla Jane</field><field name="description">Towards the end of the last century in Australia one aspect of the restructuring of work has been a major increase in the number of people who are employed on a casual basis. The &#8216;traditional&#8217; full time permanent job is no longer available to many people.
 
 This project examines aspects of the personal and work lives of casual TAFE lecturers in the Perth metropolitan area. It provides a specific case study of workers who have been affected by the changes in the workforce which have developed over the past 25 years. In particular, these are workers who, given their tertiary education and work experience, would not necessarily have expected to be employed on a casual basis but who are now part of the roughly 27% of the workforce employed in this mode.
 
 Supporters of the restructured workforce claim that work flexibility has advantages for the economy and for both the employer and the employee and argue that many are happy to work in this mode. This project seeks to test this assertion, to examine briefly the economic and political features that led to casual work being adopted as the preferred employment model at TAFE in Western Australia, and to consider in detail its consequences for some of those employed in this manner.
 
 Through a series of interviews of 40 casual TAFE lecturers it investigates some of the particular features of such employment; such as how people obtain and maintain work, and whether they regard themselves as having a career, as well as looking at broader aspects such as stigma, insecurity and the place of risk in the workplace. The research reveals that while this mode of employment suits a subset of casual employees, others pine for greater security and certainty in their working lives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/690/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of novel diagnostic and vaccine options for beak and feather disease virus (BFDV)</field><field name="creator">Shearer, Patrick Leslie</field><field name="description">Beak and Feather Disease Virus (BFDV) is a circovirus which causes ill-thrift, feather loss and immunosuppression leading to secondary infections and eventually death in psittacine birds. The development of standardised reagents for the detection and characterisation of BFDV infections and for the production of protective vaccines has been difficult as no cell culture system has yet been found to grow the virus successfully in vitro. However, the development of consistent and effective diagnostic tests and vaccines is now more practical through the application of nucleic acid-based detection methods and recombinant technology.
 
 A quantitative real-time PCR assay for the detection of BFDV DNA was developed, using primers designed to amplify a conserved 81 bp fragment of ORFV1 and SYTO9, a fluorescent intercalating dye, with assays run on a Corbett RotorGene 3000. A synthetic oligonucleotide was used to establish standard curves for the quantitation of viral load in both blood and feather preparations. The assay was very sensitive, with a detection limit of 50 copies/&#236;L. The assay was developed using BFDV-positive DNA extracts from the feathers of 10 different species of birds and validated with blood and feather samples from corellas vaccinated with an experimental BFDV vaccine, then challenged with live virus. Viral DNA was reliably detected in the blood of all control (non-vaccinated) birds and in some vaccinated birds. Contamination of the environment with the feather dander of BFDV-infected birds meant that HA feather preparations were unreliable for the detection and quantitation of viral excretion. Nonetheless, the assay should prove to be a useful and sensitive test for the detection of viral DNA in a range of samples in future investigations.
 
 A recombinant BFDV capsid protein was also produced and a specific monoclonal antibody developed against it. The behaviour of the protein in haemagglutination (HA) assays and the behaviour of the monoclonal antibody in western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), ELISA and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays were characterised. The protein had the ability to agglutinate galah erythrocytes as per the wild-type virus and this agglutination was successfully inhibited by antibodies to wild-type BFDV from naturally immune psittacine birds. Furthermore, the protein self-assembled into virus-like particles as determined by electron microscopy. The antibody was specific for both the recombinant BFDV capsid protein and the whole virus and had similar optimal titres when used in western blotting and IHC. The antibody also had HI activity and detected BFDV virus from 3 genera of psittacine birds, including the recently described cockatiel BFDV isolate. A novel &#8220;blocking&#8221; (or &#8220;competitive&#8221;) ELISA (bELISA) for the detection of anti- BFDV antibodies in psittacine sera (Ab-bELISA) was also developed and validated with 166 samples from eastern long-billed corellas vaccinated with the recombinant capsid protein and challenged with live virus. The bELISA was found to be both sensitive and specific and correlated strongly with the HI test, thus it should have wide application for the serodiagnosis of BFDV.
 
 A survey of cockatiels (n=88) housed at commercial aviaries was conducted to investigate whether BFDV infection occurs in cockatiels. All birds were diagnosed as being virus-free by PCR and HA and had no detectable antibody titre by HI assay. In addition to this, the genomes of two BFDV isolates obtained from diseased cockatiel feathers were sequenced and cross-reactivity assays performed using virus eluted from these feathers and sera from naturally immune psittacine birds. Serological cross-reactivity results and phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences indicated that the cockatiel virus isolates were serologically and genetically different to other BFDV isolates. This is the first report of an antigenically distinct BFDV in psittacine birds. Since the Ab-bELISA has a lower limit of detection than the HI assay, it was used to repeat the cockatiel sero-survey. No antibodies were detectable in any of the cockatiels tested and thus questions about the real prevalence of BFDV infection in cockatiels and the possible existence of a novel BFDV serotype adapted to cockatiels remain unanswered.
 
 The successful control of PBFD in both pet and wild birds depends on the development of vaccines that incite a strong specific immune response and can be efficiently produced in large quantities. Recombinant BFDV capsid proteins have recently been considered as candidate vaccines against BFDV and recombinant techniques allow the development of other candidate vaccines, including DNA vaccines. In order to examine the potential of DNA vaccination as a strategy for the prevention and control of BFDV, two DNA vaccines, based on the nucleotide sequence encoding the capsid protein of BFDV, were developed using the mammalian expression vector pVAX1. The vaccine constructs encoding both the full length and NLS-truncated capsid protein resulted in protein expression both in vitro and in vivo. Protein was detected in COS-7 cells transfected with the constructs with an indirect immunocytochemistry assay using the monoclonal antibody described in Chapter 5. Protein was present in the nucleus of cells transfected with the vaccine encoding the full-length nucleotide sequence and in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with the vaccine encoding the NLS-truncated sequence as expected. Both DNA vaccine constructs induced detectable levels of anti-BFDV antibodies in vaccinated birds, determined using the Ab-bELISA described in Chapter 5. Thus, DNA vaccines similar to those presented here may have application in the prevention and control of BFDV and some options for the further development of these vaccines into effective methods for the control of BFDV are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/691/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participation of Indigenous students in education: an exploration of the significance of place in an Indigenous community school</field><field name="creator">Mudhan, Parmesh</field><field name="description">This study explores the pedagogical significance of life experiences of Indigenous students from an Australian community school and its relation to school participation.

With the rate of participation of Indigenous students in education currently lower compared with non-Indigenous students, this study further informs our understanding of this phenomenon.
 
 The study is interpretive, based on the perspectives of students, staff and parents of an Indigenous community school successful in improving participation of Indigenous students to Year 10, and informed by the researcher&#8217;s own lived experiences teaching Indigenous students in three different countries. During this time, it was observed that Indigenous students&#8217; association with place was a significant factor in their participation in education.
 
 Gruenewald&#8217;s multidimensional framework for place-conscious education is employed to guide the analysis and interpretation of data as it provides a means of addressing two important issues revealed in the review of literature on participation. First, participation is examined and interpreted in different ways, and second, a common thread in the differing interpretations is the concept of place. Analyses of the data reveal two overarching dimensions: Place and Aboriginality. Further analysis, informed by notions of place-conscious education reveal five identifiable elements for enhancing participation of Indigenous students in education: Curriculum Method, Curriculum Content, Careers, Partners and Identity. Educational programs that recognise how these elements are related to place and action them are likely to be more effective in enhancing participation of Indigenous students in education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/693/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evidence of HIV-1 adaptation to HLA-restricted immune responses at a population level</field><field name="creator">Moore, Corey Benjamin</field><field name="description">Selection of HIV-1 variants resistant to antiretroviral therapy is well documented. However, the selection in vivo of HIV-1 mutant species that can escape host immune system HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses has, to date, only been documented in a few individuals and its clinical importance is not well understood. This thesis analyses the observed diversity of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase protein in a well characterised, stable, HLA-diverse cohort of HIV-1 infected patients with over two thousand patient-years of observation. The results show that HIV-1 polymorphism is selected within functional constraints and is associated with specific HLA class I alleles. Furthermore, these associations significantly cluster along the sequence and tend to occur within known corresponding HLA-restricted epitopes. Absence of polymorphism is also HLA-specific and more often seen with common HLA alleles. Knowledge of HLA specific viral polymorphisms can be used to model an individual&#8217;s viral load from their HLA type and viral sequence. These results suggest that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape mutation in HIV-1 is critical to the host at an individual and population level as well as to short and long term viral evolution.

The latter part of the chapter records some of the previously achieved assemblies of quinones A 10 and A' 11 in both racemic and enantiopure form, as well as the only synthesis of enantiopure quinone-pm 13.
 
 Chapter 2 involves the preparation of regioselectively halogenated aryldioxolanes starting with the allylation of brominated and chlorinated phenols.   The isomerisation of these dioxolanes into the corresponding halogenated 2-benzopyrans is then investigated.
 
 Chapter 3 examines the regioselectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction between protected benzopyranquinones and the substituted diene 1-methoxy-1,3-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-buta-1,3-diene 80.  Such protection involves preparing the acetates and methoxymethyl ethers of the benzopyranquinones. The latter part of the chapter describes the direct bromination of benzopyranquinones.
 
 Chapter 4 reports on the stereoselective reaction between metal phenolates and the chiral aldehyde 108 to subsequently afford naphthyldioxolanes 264, 291, 292 and 295.  The rearrangement reaction of the derived naphthyldioxolane 295 is then investigated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/695/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence, risk factors and molecular epidemiology  of Brachyspira pilosicoli in humans and animals</field><field name="creator">Margawani, Kusuma Rini</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis was concerned with identifying the prevalence and risk factors associated with colonisation by the intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira pilosicoli in:
 
 humans: long term residents of Perth, Western Australia (WA) and Indonesians either living temporarily in Perth or as long term residents in urban and rural areas of Bali, Indonesia,
 
 animals: domestic animals including alpacas, birds, cattle, cats, chickens, dogs, doves, ducks, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep (housed at a wide variety of places around Perth), and a range of wild animals housed in various Zoos and wildlife centres in WA.
 
 This study shows that for humans:
 
 &#8226; Brachyspira pilosicoli was significantly more prevalent in Indonesians of all sub groups, be they temporary residents of Perth (9.4% - 216 faecal samples from 180 individuals), or long term residents of Indonesia (12.6% - 992 faecal samples from 617 individuals) compared with long term residents of Australia living mainly in Perth (0.2% of 766 sampled), even in those with gastrointestinal complaints. This suggests a relationship between a high prevalence of B. pilosicoli and living in Indonesia;
 &#8226; In Bali, B. pilosicoli was significantly more prevalent in the impoverished urban area of Sesetan (20.3-23.4%) where the husbandry of pigs is poor and effluent treatment is non-existent compared to four traditional farming villages (Badung, Karang Suwung, Melinggih, Payangan Desa) (3.3-22.6%). In the latter villages effluent and drainage is better and there is less likely to be contamination of drinking water
 &#8226; There was no significant association between the presence of B. pilosicoli and the presence of clinical symptoms including headaches, abdominal pains, diarrhoea, joint/muscular pain and constipation.
 &#8226; Amongst Indonesians living in Indonesia, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of B. pilosicoli between people with and without contact with animals and between farmers and other occupational groups.
 &#8226; Indonesians visiting Perth who were positive for B. pilosicoli originated from nine cities and five main islands in Indonesia. This suggests that B. pilosicoli is endemic throughout Indonesia.
 &#8226; Strain typing of isolates of B. pilosicoli showed that they were genetically heterogenous and did not show any consistent pattern with respect to geographical location, family of origin or disease status. Isolates from the same individual were sometimes unrelated, suggesting the probability of re-infection with another strain between the samplings.
 &#8226; Some households (~7%) had more than one member positive for B. pilosicoli. Strain analysis suggested transmission between family members, and this could be due to either faecal-oral transmission, or from a common external source, such as contaminated water.
 &#8226; B. pilosicoli was cultured from only 0.2% of Australians. This low prevalence may be a result of little or no exposure to B. pilosicoli due to good personal hygiene and environmental sanitation.
 &#8226; B. pilosicoli strain H1b and H171 that were isolated from healthy Indonesians were able to colonise mice and day-old chickens, and induced clinical signs of pasty faeces in the latter. Histological sections showed mild typhlitis and typical end-on attachment of B. pilosicoli to the caecal epithelial mucosa of the chickens. This finding suggests that the human isolates had pathogenic potential.
 
 This study showed that for animals investigated:
 
 &#8226; Intestinal spirochaetes were cultured from 46.4% (13/28) of bilbies with 14.3% (4/28) positive for B. pilosicoli. Spirochaetes were also cultured from the faeces of two Western Barred bandicoots and one (1.2%) kangaroo.
 &#8226; Intestinal spirochaetes were not isolated from any alpacas, cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep but were detected in 40.5% of ducks, 14.3% of chickens, 14.9% of ostriches and 1.5% of cats.
 &#8226; Few pets that are commonly kept in households (dogs, cats and aviary birds) were colonised, suggesting that they are not an important focus of B. pilosicoli infection in Australia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/696/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting to know you: the journey from refugee to African-Australian</field><field name="creator">Macdougall, Nicolette</field><field name="description">In this thesis I adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to explore the experiences of African humanitarian migrants in Australia. I argue that effective integration and positive settlement outcomes for this group would be enhanced by a clearer understanding of their originating circumstances and culture(s).
 
 I employ a combination of ethnography, autoethnography and narrative styles to articulate different aspects of the lived experience of flight and settlement of twelve individual African refugee women. These stories were collected through semi- and unstructured personal interviews over a period of two years. They emerge out of my evolving relationships with the participants, and highlight the importance of friendship and active listening in promoting positive cross-cultural interaction.
 
 The narrative accounts are supplemented and augmented by documentary chapters that examine the broader socio-political aspects of culture, war and refugees in Africa.  The fine detail of the individual experiences of flight, settlement and relationships converge with these contextual accounts to open a window on the social world of humanitarian migrants. Together, they provide a layered and multi-faceted account of the life and times of African refugees and the challenges that they face in Australia in the 21st Century.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/697/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bias challenges in international arbitration: the need for a 'real danger' test</field><field name="creator">Luttrell, Samuel Ross</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/698/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural network classification based on quantification of uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Kraipeerapun, Pawalai</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with feedforward backpropagation neural networks and interval neutrosophic sets for the binary and multiclass classification problems.

These results together with the uncertainty of type error and vagueness occurred in the prediction are then represented in the form of interval neutrosophic sets. Each element in an interval neutrosophic set consists of three membership values: truth, indeterminacy, and false. These three membership values are then used in the classification process. For binary classification, a pair of neural networks is first applied in order to predict the degrees of truth and false membership values. Subsequently, bagging technique is applied to an ensemble of pairs of neural networks in order to improve the performance. For multiclass classification, two basic multiclass classification methods are proposed. A pair of neural networks with multiple outputs and multiple pairs of binary neural network are experimented. A number of aggregation techniques are proposed in this thesis. The difference between each pair of the truth and false membership values determines the vagueness value. Error occurred in the prediction are estimated using an interpolation technique. Both vagueness and error then form the indeterminacy membership. Two and three dimensional visualization of the three membership values are also presented. Ten data sets obtained from UCI machine learning repository are experimented with the proposed approaches.

The common causes of scouring in sheep of post-weaning age in Western Australia have not been well described.
 
 In a written questionnaire sent to sheep producers in the south west of Western Australia, about half of the respondents reported lamb, hogget and ewe flocks with moderate or severe dag. Flocks with moderate or severe dag were reported more commonly in the winter and spring months in all age groups. Young sheep and mated ewes were most susceptible to moderate or severe dag. The utilisation of professional worm control advice and parasite management tools did not reduce the risk of moderate/severe dag.  
 
 A study conducted at an abattoir showed that large strongyle worm egg  counts (WEC) were frequently identified in lamb lines but were much less common in adult lines. The relationship between WEC and scouring was not clear, suggesting that factors other than large strongyle infections were important, particularly in adult sheep. The low WEC and seasonal scouring pattern observed in adult sheep was consistent with the larval hypersensitivity scouring syndrome and/or factors related to green pasture as potential common causes of scouring in adult sheep. This observation was consistent with detailed investigations of flocks with "low WEC scouring" that found larval hypersensitivity scouring syndrome or factors associated with green pasture were the most likely causes of scouring in eight of the nine flocks examined. Large immature worm burdens were common and the scouring sheep had more fourth stage larvae than normal sheep. Treatment with a fully effective drench and an ivermectin controlled-release rumen capsule did not result in a reduction of faecal moisture content between three and seven weeks after treatment.
 
 The effects of dietary soluble non-starch polysaccharides were studied using  carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as a model. The CMC model was used to demonstrate that significant interactions between diet and strongyle larvae  determined both faecal consistency and strongyle establishment. Sheep fed CMC had softer, looser and wetter faeces, but the factors that determined faecal consistency were complex. Establishment of T. colubriformis was significantly greater in sheep fed CMC suggesting that the environment within the gut may affect establishment of T. colubriformis in the small intestine. The findings suggested that dietary factors may interact with strongyle larvae to determine both worm establishment and severity of scouring.
 
 The results of the studies described in this thesis suggested that factors related to immature strongyle larvae, diet and the immune response interact to determine the severity of the scouring observed in sheep of post-weaning age in the south west of Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/700/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The new spin: Effects of information control behaviours on source trustworthiness and persuasion</field><field name="creator">Hynd, Dale</field><field name="description">Given the high level of skepticism from the public toward politicians, this research explores the communication styles that separate public figures who are trusted and supported from those who are not. Contrary to conventional practice, it is argued that the use of &#8216;spin&#8217; in political communication is a large factor contributing to the public&#8217;s negative perception of politicians. Political spin is defined as a communication style encompassing specific behaviours designed to appeal to the media, control information, and contain the meaning audiences derive from a message. This research operationalised spin as it is used in political communication and compared participants&#8217; responses to messages with low and high levels of spin. The present research comprised three studies. In Study One, interviews were conducted with communication professionals to define the concept and specific &#8216;information control behaviours&#8217; associated with spin. An &#8216;authenticity&#8217; scale was then developed to measure audience responses to low and high-spin messages. In Study Two, 50 participants were randomly assigned to view a series of low or high-spin political messages. Participants rated messages from a confederate politician as well as actual politicians, government officials, and corporate representatives using the Authenticity Scale. Study Three was conducted throughout the 5-weeks of political campaigning prior to a general election. A representative sample of 60 voters was used each week in a repeated measures design to rate the political candidates and two confederate politicians using the Authenticity Scale. It was found that participants were able to clearly discern the degree of spin used by politicians when communicating a message. Messages containing a high level of spin elicited more negative attitudes and significantly lower levels of support for politicians, than messages containing a low level of spin. Specifically, participants&#8217; perceptions of source trustworthiness and credibility were significantly higher for politicians using a low-spin style of communication. The findings are discussed in terms of the expectancy disconfirmation theory. The findings suggest that adopting a new low-spin style of communication will assist public figures to communicate more persuasively and to better engage an increasingly skeptical public.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/701/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A national study of gastrointestinal parasites infecting dogs and cats in Australia</field><field name="creator">Holyoake, Carlysle Sian</field><field name="description">Despite the popularity of companion animal ownership in Australia, recent and comprehensive information with regard to the prevalence, epidemiology and public health significance associated with gastrointestinal parasites of pet dogs and cats in Australia is largely lacking.   The primary aims of this study were to close this knowledge gap and to evaluate the veterinarian&#8217;s perception, awareness and knowledge of GI parasites in their locality, from a veterinary and public health stand-point.  This included sourcing information with regard to commonly recommended deworming protocols.  The awareness of pet owners regarding parasitic zoonoses and the degree of education provided to them by veterinarians was also determined.
 
 A total of 1400 canine and 1063 feline faecal samples were collected from veterinary clinics and refuges from across Australia. The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs and cats was 23.9% (CI 21.7-26.1) and 18.4% (CI 16.1-20.7), respectively. Overall Giardia duodenalis was the most prevalent parasite in dogs (9.3%, CI 7.8-10.8) followed by hookworm (6.7%, CI 5.4-8.0). Isospora felis was the most prevalent parasite in cats (5.6%, CI 4.2-7.0), followed by Toxocara cati (3.2%, CI 2.1-4.3).  
 
 A highly sensitive and species-specific PCR-RFLP technique was utilized to differentiate the various hookworm species which can infect dogs and cats directly from eggs in faeces. Ancylostoma ceylanicum was detected for the first time in Australia in 10.9% of the dogs found positive for hookworm. This was a significant finding in terms of the zoonotic risk associated with this parasite.
 
 The zoonotic potential of Giardia and Cryptosporidium was investigated by genetically characterising isolates recovered from dogs and cats. All but one of the Giardia isolates successfully genotyped were host specific, indicating a low zoonotic risk. It was hypothesized that the lack of zoonotic Giardia Assemblages was a consequence of there being a low prevalence of Giardia in the human population. The Cryptosporidium recovered from dogs and cats was determined to be Cryptosporidium canis and Cryptosporidium felis respectively, a finding which supports growing evidence that Cryptosporidium in companion animals is of limited public health significance to healthy people.
 
 Very few of the veterinarians surveyed in the study routinely discussed the zoonotic potential of pet parasites with clients. Most of the veterinarians recommended the regular prophylactic administration of anthelmintics throughout a pet&#8217;s life.
 
 The low national prevalence of GI parasites reported is most likely a consequence of the widespread use of anthelmintics by pet owners. There is an over-reliance on anthelmintics by veterinarians to prevent and control parasites and their zoonotic risk. This has resulted in veterinarians becoming complacent about educating pet owners about parasites. A combination of routinely screening faecal samples for parasites, strategic anthelmintic regimes and improved pet owner education is recommended for the control of GI parasites in pet dogs and cats in Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/703/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parasites of native and exotic freshwater fishes in the south-west of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Hassan, Marina</field><field name="description">Fewer than 200 fish species are found in freshwater habitats in Australia, of which 144 are confined exclusively to freshwater. At least 22 species of exotic freshwater fish have been introduced into Australia, and 19 of these have established self-sustaining populations. However, the parasite fauna of both native and exotic freshwater fishes in Australia is poorly known. This is particularly the case in the south-west of Western Australia, where there have been no previous comprehensive studies of the parasites of 14 native species and nine or more exotic species of fish found in freshwater habitats.
 
 This study represents a survey of the parasites of freshwater fishes in the South West Coast Drainage Division and reports 44 putative species of parasites in 1429 individual fishes of 18 different species (12 native and six exotic) from 29 locations. Parasites were found in 327 (22.88%) fishes, and of the infected fishes, 200 (61.16%) were infected with only one species of parasite and 127 (38.84%) were infected with two or more species of parasites. For helminth and arthropod parasites, which were more comprehensively surveyed than protozoan and myxozoans, I found 37 species compared to 77 species found in a recent study of fishes from the East Coast Drainage Division.
 
 The present study demonstrated that parasitic infection was significantly more common in native fish species (mean prevalence of infection with any species of parasite = 0.36 &#177; 0.09) than in exotic fish species (0.01 &#177; 0.12). Parasites were found in all native fish species, but in only two exotic fish species that were examined. Parasite regional and component community diversity were estimated by species richness (the number of species, S) and by an index of taxonomic diversity (HT). Both parasite species richness and parasite taxonomic diversity were significantly greater in native fish species (mean S = 10.5 &#177; 2.3; mean HT = 1.19 &#177; 0.14) than in exotic fish species (mean S = 1.6 &#177; 3.3; mean HT = 0.27 &#177; 0.20). These relationships were consistent over all geographic locations that were sampled. The reduced parasite load of exotic species compared to native species has been previous reported across a wide range of taxa. It is thought to arise partly because founding populations of hosts have a low probability of harbouring the species&#8217; total parasite fauna, and partly because parasites that infect introduced exotic species may not be able to maintain their life cycle in the new environment. It has been suggested that a reduced parasite load increases the competitive ability of exotic species compared to native species (the parasite release hypothesis) and this may partly explain the abundance and apparent competitive success of exotic over native species of freshwater fish in the South West Coast Drainage Division.
 
 For native species of fish, there were major differences among species in both prevalence of parasitic infection and parasite community diversity, but this variation was not related to fish size, whether the fish were primarily freshwater or primarily estuarine, or whether they were primarily demersal or pelagic.
 
 In this study, I report two new parasites in south western Australian waters. Both are copepod parasites; Lernaea cyprinacea and a new species of Dermoergasilus. The Dermoergasilus appears to be native to the south-west of Western Australia and has been described as Dermoergasilus westernensis. It differs from previously described species in the genus principally by the armature of the legs. This new species was found on the gills of freshwater cobbler, Tandanus bostocki and western minnow, Galaxias occidentalis in two different river systems.
 
 Lernaea cyprinacea is an introduced parasitic copepod found on the skin and gills of freshwater fishes in many areas of the world. The parasite has not previously been reported in Western Australia. We found infestations of L. cyprinacea on four native fish species (G. occidentalis; Edelia vittata; Bostockia porosa; T. bostocki) and three introduced fish species (Carassius auratus; Gambusia holbrooki; Phalloceros caudimaculatus) at two localities in the Canning River, in the south-west of Western Australia. The parasite has the potential to have serious pathogenic effects on native fish species, although it appears to be currently localised to a small section of the Canning River.
 
 Over all localities from which fishes were sampled in the present study, the proportion of native freshwater fishes with parasitic infections and the component community diversity of the parasite fauna of native fishes were both negatively related to habitat disturbance, in particular to a suite of factors (river regulation, loss of riparian vegetation, eutrophication and presence of exotic fish species) that indicate increased human usage of the river and surrounding environment. The reduced parasite load and diversity in native fishes from south-west rivers with greater human usage was due principally to the loss of a number of species of trematode, cestode and nematode endoparasites which use fishes as intermediate hosts. Other studies have also found that endoparasites with complex life cycles are most likely to be adversely affected by environmental changes, presumably because any environmental changes which impact on either free-living parasite stages or on any of the hosts in the complex train of parasite transmission will reduce parasite population size and may cause local extinction of the parasite species.
 
 The most heavily infected species of native freshwater fish in the South West Coast Drainage Division was T. bostocki with 96% of all individuals containing at least one species of parasite. As with most freshwater fishes of south-west Australia, T. bostocki is limited in its distribution to waterways with relatively low salinity. The degree of parasitism and histopathology of internal and external organs in T. bostocki from the Blackwood River was examined over a period of rapid, seasonal changes in water salinity. As salinity increased, the infracommunity richness and prevalence of ectoparasites on the skin of fishes decreased, while the infracommunity richness and prevalence of endoparasites increased. This was associated with a decrease in histopathological lesion scores in the skin and an increase in histopathological lesion scores in internal organs, particularly the intestine. I hypothesise that the seasonal spike in salinity had two contrasting effects on parasitic infections of T. bostocki. Firstly, it increased the mortality rate of parasites directly exposed to water, leading to a decrease in ectoparasitic infection and associated pathology. Secondly, it suppressed immune function in fish, leading to a decreased mortality rate of parasites not directly exposed to water and a more severe pathological response to endoparasitism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/704/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protection or paternalism: A critical evaluation of Australian legislation relating to sexual acts involving persons with intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Graydon, Clare Marie</field><field name="description">As a result of the development and recognition of human rights and of the principle of normalisation, in recent decades sweeping changes have occurred in the living conditions of many people with intellectual disability.
 The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons (1971)contains statements to the effect that, as far as possible, the lives of disabled persons should resemble those of their non-disabled peers, and this presumably extends to sexual expression. However, the words &#8220;as far as possible&#8221; imply that in some circumstances, limitations on a right may be  justifiable. One such circumstance is where a competing right exists, for example, the right to sexual expression has to be balanced against a right to protection. Under some conditions, the provision of protective measures may fall to the criminal justice system, which may be used to afford protection to persons with intellectual disability. Australian jurisdictions have used three different approaches in current legislation: to set a minimum standard of sexual knowledge that must be present before the person is deemed capable of consent to sexual activities; to prohibit sexual relations with persons holding power or authority over the person; and to proscribe all sexual exploitation. This thesis contains proposals for reforms to each category of legislative provisions. First, it is suggested that the standard of knowledge required to support consent should more closely resemble the knowledge required for informed consent to medical procedures. Second, restrictions on sexual activity with persons with intellectual disability based on employment status should be relaxed where the role of the staff member does not confer power to coerce people with intellectual disability. Third, with regard to the prosecution of offences against incapable persons with mental impairment, it is proposed that the charge should be sex without consent. On the other hand, it is argued that prosecution under criminal law is inappropriate where a vulnerable but capable person is deemed to have been exploited. The thesis contains a number of further recommendations for the reform of anomalies which exist between the general law of sexual offences and those committed specifically against persons with mental impairment. It is suggested that marriage be abolished as a defence to sexual acts with an incapable person and that offences against persons with mental impairment carry equivalent penalties to general sexual offences. On the basis of literature reviewed in this thesis, two additional proposals have  been made. First, that education in the sexual rights of persons with intellectual impairment should be given to carers so that they do not unduly inhibit the development of sexual relationships by that person. The second proposal is that reform should be accompanied by the provision of repeated, appropriate, detailed and specific sex education of all persons with intellectual impairment and that this education should be based on needs identified in the aforementioned research. The tentative outcome of proposals contained in this thesis is that persons capable of consent would enjoy enhanced freedom to exercise their right to sexual expression, and those incapable of consent would be afforded more certain protection.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/705/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology, ecology and spirituality: neopaganism and hybrid ontologies in technoculture</field><field name="creator">Gallacher, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis considers three convergent issues pertinent to investigations of identity and agency in contemporary society: the proliferation of digital, network technologies, the rise of interest in secular &#8212; &#8216;new edge&#8217; &#8212; spiritualities, and our growing awareness of impending ecological crises. I argue that these three issues necessitate a critical reconsideration of human agency, one that embodies a more sustainable and responsible &#8216;being-in-the-world&#8217;. With this goal in mind, I apply the insights of ecofeminism, feminist approaches to technology and science, and the philosophy of technology, to provide a critical analysis of the human-technology relation in the broader contexts of gender, ecology and spirituality. In particular, I highlight the strengths of ecofeminism, and then employ several alternative theories in order to attend to limitations I identify within ecofeminism; in particular, its uncompromising stance towards modern technology as wholly patriarchal and damaging to both nature and women. Against this position, I argue that technology is fully embedded in and central to our being-in-the-world, and thus must be accounted for in any consideration of contemporary agency. I then attend to both technophobic and technophilic approaches to technology and technoscience in feminism more generally, suggesting how these oppositional tensions are embodied in the figures of the &#8216;cyborg&#8217; and the &#8216;goddess&#8217;. In search of more complex, hybridised ways to understand the human-technology relation, I then turn to three key theorists &#8211; Don Ihde, Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour. Synergising their approaches with the neopagan worldview, I propose a metaphorical and material identity which properly attends to and incorporates the treble issues of ecology, technology and spirituality into its worldview: the technopagan. At once nature-worshipper and digital dweller, the technopagan is a dynamic, multi-faceted and adaptable agent that can effectively challenge traditional humanist binaries between nature and technology, science and religion, and human and nonhuman.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/706/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that influence participation in self-management of wound care in three Indigenous communities in Western Australia: Clients' perspectives</field><field name="creator">Eades, Anne-Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to identify any barriers or enablers as influences on wound care self-management by Indigenous people. A qualitative, interpretive study sought to investigate how participants perceived their wounds and their general health, and to identify the influences on them accessing wound care services.
 
 There is a dearth of information on culturally appropriate practice in wound management for Indigenous Australians. This research project was therefore significant in attempting to bridge the gap in nursing knowledge of Indigenous clients' perceptions of barriers and enablers for seeking wound care services,especially in relation to lower leg ulcers. The lack of culturally sensitive wound management practices potentially impacts on Indigenous clients' behaviours in seeking treatment from their health service providers.
 
 Participant observations and semi-structured interviews with the research participants investigated the management of their wounds, and the ways in which their culture influences wound management. The main aim was to understand participants' comprehension of the importance of wound care through reflection. Understanding the enhancing or obstructive influences on wound management practices was expected to provide a foundation for teaching self care of wounds in Indigenous populations and inform health professionals' approach to health education.
 
 The data were analysed using thematic analysis, which generated common themes related to the research questions. These themes are: visibility, of the problem,4 perceived versus actual level of knowledge, acceptance of co-morbid health conditions and pre-determined path of ill health. These findings indicated that in one region, participants' perception of poor health was related to visibility of the problem. Participants chose to have their visible wounds managed by Silver Chain Nursing Association, whereas Diabetes and Hypertension and any other non-visible disorders were seen as appropriate to the Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS). Further to this finding, most participants displayed a sense of helplessness and hopelessness when sharing information about their diagnosis of diabetes, believing this was the norm. Many also believed that having a strong family history of a particular disease resulted in the participants also inheriting the disease. During post interview educational sessions many of the Indigenous participants were surprised by the evidence based-research reported to them by the researcher that diabetes is a manageable disease with life style changes.  
 
 Another issue highlighted was the perceived level of knowledge the participants had about wound care. Reassurance was given by the participants that their level of knowledge about how to manage their wounds was adequate. However, none of the participants were concerned about the length of time that their wound/s had or were being managed, between 3 months and 5 years. This acceptance that although a wound is not getting any worse and not getting any better was the norm is cause for concern, and indicates a low level of health literacy. This theme was 'perceiving an imbalance in perceptions of wound care knowledge with actual knowledge'.

This thesis considers the dynamic of these conditions within a focused long-term study of the art and life of Indonesian "Surealis" painter, Lucia Hartini. My doctoral dissertation comprises this thesis and the forty-two minute documentary film Perbatasan / Boundaries: Lucia Hartini, Paintings from a Life (1999 &#8211; 2002) which I filmed in Indonesia and presents Lucia Hartini and her art in the context of her times from the historical standpoint of Reformasi and millennial change. Art historically, this thesis informs us of a wider journey, that of selected twentieth century Indonesian contemporary artists exploring concepts of simulacra, hyper-reality, the meta-real and the surreal through the stylistic use of photo-realism.
 
 Lucia Hartini is known for her "Beautiful Surrealism". A founding member of the "Surealis Yogya", formed in 1985, she was the only woman from the original group to continue painting professionally from the late 1970s, throughout the New Order, and into the era of Reform. The consideration of Lucia Hartini's work in this thesis acknowledges the gradual shift in her concerns. Lucia's paintings respond to her natural and social environment, as well as to the challenges and dramatic changes in her life. This thesis charts the journey of her artistic maturation, so richly embodied in her third solo exhibition, "Irama Kehidupan / The Spirit of Life", in January 2002. Through a critical commentary on paintings selected from her oeuvre and the textual analysis of Perbatasan / Boundaries, I discuss Lucia Hartini&#8217;s subject matter, unique systems of image formation and use of detail, her particular contribution to the characteristic qualities of Indonesian "Surealisme". I regard the techniques, conceptual approaches and processes of filmmaking as intrinsic to this exploration, a methodological perspective arising from Hendro Wiyanto (2001) observation that Indonesia's "Surealis" artists present us with "reality bundled as a dream".
 
 Lucia Hartini&#8217;s work raises questions of gender and personal transformation. This thesis argues that, for many years, the tensions created by the contrary forces of political repression and social transformation characterising much of New Order Indonesia, were reflected in her art. In a microcosmic-macrocosmic sense, Lucia and her art quietly contributed to attitudinal and social change in Indonesia. Works painted between 1986 and 1996 autobiographically chart a shift from personal distress to a growing sense of empowerment, followed by life-changing spiritual growth. I contextualize these paintings socially by studying the changing interstices between Lucia Hartini&#8217;s private life, her professional creative practice and the public persona she adopted in Indonesia&#8217;s emergent civilian society. My approach is informed by a conceptual framework based on difference, hybridity and its transformations, on the psychology of borderlands, negotiation and the transcendence of boundaries, witnessed through a study of the spiritual practice and quest for religious tolerance important to Lucia and evident in her art. This thesis reveals those boundaries which were transcended and those which remain negotiable.
 
 Twice filming Lucia Hartini&#8217;s art, I was also affected by the dramatically different conditions of production prevailing in 1992 in New Order Indonesia and those possible between 1999 and 2001 during Reformasi. These differences are highlighted in the textual analysis of Perbatasan / Boundaries. Engaging comparisons between contemporary Indonesian art and Indonesian documentary and feature films, I discuss important attempts to solve the problems associated with restrictions on freedom of expression in paintings made prior to Reformasi. I consider the different uses of figurative realism to depict subjects deemed controversial by the state, and the creation of credible representations in art and convincing characterisations in filmmaking. The dramatically real yet poetic work of the Indonesian Neo-realist filmmakers of the 1950s exemplified one such solution. Their films and ideas prompted comparisons with the photo-realism, poetic intent and dramatic juxtapositional image making of the "Surealis Yogya". The relationship I perceive between Neo-realist cinematic practice and contemporary international documentary filmmaking encouraged me to make a documentary about Lucia rather than a purely creative or experimentally surreal work. Because of Reformasi and the changes wrought by Lucia&#8217;s personal development, Perbatasan / Boundaries: Lucia Hartini, Paintings from a Life (1999 &#8211; 2002) is the documentary which my first short experimental video, Pusaran / Vortex: From the Kitchen to Outer Space (1992 - 1993), made during the New Order, could not be.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/708/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of downstream target genes of the t-cell oncoprotein HOX11 by global gene expression profiling</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Darcelle Natalie</field><field name="description">HOX11 is a homeodomain transcription factor that has been implicated in leukaemic transformation associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Its role in leukaemogenesis remains enigmatic, nevertheless, in vitro and in vivo studies have provided additional evidence supporting the role of HOX11 as an oncogene. The mechanism by which HOX11 transforms cells is yet to be elucidated, however, HOX11 has been postulated to function by binding regulatory elements within the promoter regions of specific target genes in order to control gene transcription. The identification of transcriptional targets is thus thought to be critical to our understanding of the pathways controlled by this master gene regulator. To date, only three candidate HOX11 target genes have been reported and given that HOX11 overexpression can have a profound impact on cell behaviour, it is likely that many more exist. In this study, we sought to further understand the role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis by: 1) The identification of novel putative HOX11 target genes by profiling gene expression in response to HOX11 in a number of cell lines using a combination of RDA, cDNA microarray and GeneChip approaches and 2) confirming target gene status by assessing whether the proximal promoters of the leading candidates identified are transcriptionally regulated by HOX11.
 
 To identify genes whose expression was altered by HOX11, three techniques were employed, namely representational difference analysis, cDNA microarray and Affymetrix GeneChip array. Because of the relative novelty of these technologies, all three methods were employed in a complementary manner. While representational difference analysis did not require dedicated equipment and enabled the identification of novel genes, the technique was labour-intensive and also exhibited a number of problems including high levels of background. Emphasis was therefore placed on the more systematic microarray approaches that enabled a global investigation of expression patterns and thus the identification of a range of candidate target genes. Initially, this involved cDNA microarray experiments, however, during the course of this work Affymetrix GeneChip technology became available. The latter was identified as the most appropriate technology for the identification of candidate target genes because of its relative ease of use, as well as its employment of multiple independent probe pairs which greatly improved background noise, increased the range and accuracy of detection, minimized the effects of cross hybridization and drastically reduced the rate of false positives and miscalls.
 
 Using these combined approaches, several genes of interest were identified which were differentially regulated in the presence of HOX11 and thus may represent oncogenically or physiologically relevant target genes. These included OSTEOPONTIN, PAG, GUANOSINE DIPHOSPHATE DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR 3, SUR8, GAS3, C-KIT, VEGFC, NOR1 and SMARCD3. In order to confirm their role as target genes, four candidates (C-KIT, VEGFC, NOR1 and SMARCD3) were characterized in terms of the ability of their proximal promoters to be transcriptionally regulated by HOX11 using luciferase reporter assays. Significant repression of the proximal promoters of C-KIT and VEGFC by HOX11 was observed, which provided further evidence for their status as target genes. This repression was, however, in stark contrast to the transcriptional activation seen when the C-KIT and VEGFC proximal promoters were co-transfected with a HOX11 mutant lacking the third helix of the DNA-binding homeodomain. This unexpected finding suggested that the transcriptional activity of HOX11 is complex and highly context-dependent, and in particular, highlighted the importance of an intact homeodomain for HOX11 function.
 
 C-KIT and VEGFC are both involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways, as a receptor tyrosine kinase and tyrosine kinase ligand, respectively. C-KIT plays an important role in the survival and self-renewal of haematopoietic cells. It is a previously identified and relatively well characterized oncogene known to be regulated by other transcription factors (SCL/TAL1 and LMO) implicated in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. VEGFC is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor family that functions in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. A paracrine loop involving VEGFC and its receptor VEGFR-3 has previously been implicated in leukaemic cell survival. While further work is required in order to confirm the status of VEGFC and C-KIT as oncogenically-relevant HOX11 target genes and to characterize their exact mode of regulation, these findings implicate receptor tyrosine kinases in HOX11-mediated tumorigenesis and underscore their  potential importance as therapeutic targets in haematological malignancies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/709/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"A veritable Augustus": the life of John Winthrop Hackett, newspaper proprietor, politician and philanthropist (1848-1916)</field><field name="creator">Collins, Alexander</field><field name="description">Irish-born Sir John Winthrop Hackett (1848-1916) achieved substantial political and social standing in Western Australia through his editorship and part-ownership of the West Australian newspaper, his position as a Legislative Council member and as a layman in the Anglican Church. The thesis illustrates his strong commitment to numerous undertakings, including his major role in the establishment of Western Australia's first University.
 
 This thesis will argue that whatever Hackett attempted to achieve in Western Australia, his philosophy can be attributed to his Irish Protestant background including his student days at Trinity College Dublin. After arriving in Australia in 1875 and teaching at Trinity College Melbourne until 1882, his ambitions took him to Western Australia where he aspired to be accepted and recognised by the local establishment. He was determined that his achievements would not only be acknowledged by his contemporaries, but also just as importantly be remembered in posterity. After a failed attempt to run a sheep station, he found success as part-owner and editor of the West Australian newspaper.
 
 Outside of his business interests, Hackett&#8217;s commitment to the Anglican Church was unflagging. At the same time, he was instrumental in bringing about the abolition of state aid to church schools in Western Australia, which he saw as advantaging the Roman Catholic Church. He was a Legislative Council member for 25 years during which time he used his editorship of the West Australian, to campaign successfully on a number of social, industrial and economic issues ranging from divorce reform to the provision of economic infrastructure. As a delegate to the National Australasian Conventions he continually strove to improve the conditions under which Western Australia would join Federation. His crowning achievement was to establish the state&#8217;s first university, which he also generously provided for in his will. One of the most influential men in Western Australian history, his career epitomised the energy and ambition of the well-educated immigrant.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/710/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology, pathogenesis and surveillance of the pig adapted strain of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shih-Ping</field><field name="description">Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most contagious infectious diseases of domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals, particular in cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and domestic buffalo, as well as wild ruminants such as deer. In Taiwan, there was a severe outbreak of FMD after more than 60 years freedom from the disease. The virus strain, O Taiwan 97 from the March 1997 outbreak of FMD in Taiwan, however, has been shown to have a species-specific adaptation to pigs. Although there are 7 distinct serotypes of FMD found in different regions of the world, this study focuses on the pig-adapted type O strain of FMD.
 
 After the FMD outbreak commenced in Taiwan, the spread of disease was very rapid and the whole of the western parts of Taiwan was affected within a few days after the diagnosis of FMD was confirmed. In some situations airborne transmission of FMD virus was suspected and it was speculated that this was the explanation for such rapid spread in Taiwan. Therefore, studies were conducted to investigate the transmissibility of O Taiwan/97 FMDV to susceptible pigs by direct and indirect spread including airborne spread in an enclosed animal house. This study showed that pigs in direct contact with challenged pigs became infected but none of the close-contact pigs became infected. These experiments clearly demonstrated that the pig adapted strain O Taiwan/97 was only efficiently transmitted by direct contact. This indicates that effective control against future outbreaks of pig adapted FMDV strains could be achieved by restriction of pig movement and stamping out if the outbreak has been detected in the early stages and prior to the movements of pigs from the infected premises.
 
 The measures used to control the Taiwanese FMD outbreak in 1997 were initially the slaughter of whole herds in the infected premises. However, with the rapid spread and large numbers of cases, the decision was taken to use universal compulsory vaccination of pig herds to control the outbreak when sufficient supply of vaccines was organized. Type O FMD vaccines were imported from a number of major FMD vaccine manufactures from around the world. Initially, vaccine efficacy for the imported vaccines was tested by measurement of neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinated pigs. To establish the relationship between serum neutralizing titers and protection from foot and mouth disease in pigs after vaccination, challenge studies were conducted with O/Taiwan/97 FMD in vaccinated pigs. Additionally, antibody responses to structural (neutralizing antibody) and non-structural proteins (NSP) were evaluated in vaccinated pig herds after primary and secondary vaccination in herds infected before and after vaccination.
 
 In order to be able to monitor the circulation of virus in vaccinated pig populations, valid diagnostic kits based on the detection of antibody against NSP were required. These tests needed to be evaluated against pig sera derived from challenge studies and natural FMD outbreaks. Three commercially available ELISAs (Cedi, UBI and Checkit), which were available to differentiate infected from vaccinated pigs, were tested and results showed that the Cedi test had the optimal sensitivity and specificity for pig adapted type O FMD testing. This test was used to retrospectively evaluate the sera collected from infected and non-infected pig herds collected sequentially in the year after the 1997 FMD outbreak in Taiwan. These studies also showed that the early vaccines used, stimulated NSP antibody production in swine herds that were vaccinated but not infected. This resulted in the requirement for purified FMD vaccines to be used when monitoring programs for FMD infection by NSP testing were in place. In these studies, it was also demonstrated that the purified FMD vaccines used later in the control program did not induce NSP antibody after multiple double dosage to pigs.
 
 Although clinical FMD appeared to be successfully controlled with vaccination program in Taiwan it was essential for the eradication plan to maintain active surveillance for NSP reactors in the pig population. The UBI and Cedi NSP kits were applied as screening and confirmatory tests, respectively, to pig sera collected in auction markets distributed around Taiwan to monitor for evidence of the circulation of FMD virus. Herds with positive reactors were followed-up by clinical inspection and 15 sera from suspected herds were further sampled. Negative results were obtained from all these investigation. With the absence of clinical outbreaks and the lack of evidence of FMDV circulation in the field from the NSP reactor surveillance, the Taiwanese government has progressed the eradication plan to a progressive cessation of vaccination, commencing with banning of vaccination on one isolated island in December 2006. The absence of outbreaks on that island, paved the way for further cessation of FMD vaccination in Taiwan from July 2008.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/711/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A.O. Neville, the 'destiny of the race', and race thinking in the 1930s</field><field name="creator">Charlton, Alan David</field><field name="description">The notion of 'race' was central to the thinking about and administration of Aboriginal affairs in the 1930s, but its meaning was fluid. In many respects Auber Octavius Neville, senior bureaucrat in Western Australia from 1915-1940 and a national figure in Aboriginal affairs during that period, was emblematic of the race thinking of the period. This study looks at the Western Australian Moseley Royal Commission of 1934, the Western Australian Parliamentary debates and legislation of 1929 and 1936, the Canberra Conference of Commonwealth and State Aboriginal Authorities in 1937, and Neville's 1947 book, Australia's Coloured Minority - for their exemplification of race thinking. Basic incompatibilities and inconsistencies, as evidenced in Neville's thinking and action across his career, were common in the period. Neville's central administrative desire was to force biological absorption to its ultimate conclusion - the 'Destiny' of Aborigines of the part descent was to be absorbed biologically into the white community. He used scientific support to 'prove' the 'safety' of this strategy. The central premise of Neville's race thinking, however, was that some form of racial essentialism would always negatively impact upon the 'absorption' of Aborigines into white Australia. Other major figures differed with Neville over the suitability of absorption, notably Queensland Chief Protector, J. W. Bleakley, but still believed in some essential 'Aboriginal-ness'. The thesis also traces Neville's attempts to dominate Aboriginal affairs both in the construction of the 'problem' and in proclaiming solutions. Neville was absolutely certain that his solution was the only way forward. This certainty, when added to the inconsistent notions of race that informed his conceptualisation of the 'problem', produced policies and practices of insurmountable internal contradictions that have profoundly affected generations of Aborigines.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/712/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Vygotskian perspective on promoting critical thinking in young children through mother-child interactions</field><field name="creator">Chandra, Julia Suleeman</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how mothers, as primary caretakers, might promote the development of critical thinking of their 4- and 5-year-olds.  Interest in critical thinking in very young children can be traced back to the early years of the 20th century with views expressed by philosophers such as John Dewey and John Stuart Mill that were in favour of giving young children opportunities that might encourage their free expression and inquiring, critical nature in the school context.  Educators like Frobel and Montessori who developed programs for kindergartens worked on similar assumptions. However, how the home environment especially maternal support might foster the development of critical thinking in young children has received only minimal attention. The rise of the critical thinking movement in the 1970s enhanced the conceptualization of critical thinking, and how to assess the critical thinking ability.  But studies of the precursors of critical thinking in young children received only minimal attention.
 
 Two theoretical perspectives, the constructivist and the socio-cultural, represented by their most authoritative figures, Piaget and Vygotsky, respectively, have provided the conceptual basis for this research.  While Piaget viewed children&#8217;s cognition as developing through active construction while dealing with concrete, practical problems, Vygotsky considered children&#8217;s cognitive development as evolving through the internalization of interactions with more able people in their immediate environment.  In this thesis, Piaget&#8217;s approach to investigating children&#8217;s higher thinking processes was applied to the design of tasks that assessed critical thinking features in very young children whilst Vygotsky&#8217;s notion of the zone of proximal development was used to design the overall intervention program to develop very young children&#8217;s critical thinking through meaningful interactions with their mothers.  
 
 How critical thinking in young children might develop through mothers&#8217; interaction strategies was investigated in the context of Indonesian participants in their home settings.  In that cultural context, critical thinking is not nurtured, and even children&#8217;s curiosity is often regarded as irritating by adults.  The challenge for this study, therefore, was to design a program that would challenge the mothers&#8217; personal and cultural assumptions and to empower them to support the development of critical thinking in their young children. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated against whether and, if so, how the children&#8217;s precursors of critical thinking improved across the intervention period.  
 
 The main contributions this study was expected to make are: (1) advance the conceptualization of the nature of critical thinking in very young children (2) develop and test innovative methods to identify the features of critical thinking in very young children; and (3) identifying how mothers, having been empowered through the metacognitive program, may promote the development of critical thinking in very young children.
 
 The nature of critical thinking in very young children was operationalised through two different assessment methods specifically developed for this purpose.  One was a dynamic qualitative assessment where each child interacted with his or her mother in a teaching-learning setting.  The other consisted of a series of quantitative, Piagetian-like assessments, using play settings.  The research used a pre- and post-intervention control group design in order to allow for comparisons both within-subjects, across the intervention period, and between-subjects as another group of mother-child pairs served as control receiving no intervention.
 
 The findings revealed that very young children are able to show precursors of critical thinking consisting of both cognitive and affective elements, such as questioning, authentication, moral reasoning, and appropriate emotion.  Features indicating inhibitors of critical thinking (such as passivity and over-compliance) were also found.  Through the intervention program, the experimental group mothers learned to notice, encourage and support children's attempts at inquiry as the children grappled with making sense of their environment.  Although the precursors of critical thinking identified before the intervention continued to develop over time due to maturation (as shown by the performance of the control group children), the experimental group children performed even better over time.  In addition, the mothers of children with better performance in critical thinking tasks were observed to emphasize informing and reasoning, and to enjoy interacting with their children, rather than pressuring or commanding them.  
 
 This research has highlighted conceptual and methodological issues in identifying and assessing very young children&#8217;s critical thinking, as well as the educational implications for the promotion of children&#8217;s critical thinking at home and in schools through similar metacognitive programs for parents and teachers.  More research into the assessment of very young children&#8217;s critical thinking in different settings and with persons other than mothers is indicated, as is a focus on other factors that may influence the development of critical thinking.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/713/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lines in the sand: An anthropological discourse on wildlife tourism</field><field name="creator">Burns, Georgette Leah</field><field name="description">The management of wildlife tourism has been dominated by ideologies informed by western colonialism and its values of nature. These ideologies, made transparent through communicative and interpretative discourses, influence the way management policies and practices are devised and enacted. The inherent scientific and utilitarian views are supported by a doctrine of separation. This is apparent in the dualism posed, and enacted, between nature and culture that sees humans as being the sole carriers of culture that separates them from the uncultured and uncivilised world of nature into which all other animals, and certainly untamed wildlife, belong. It justifies the use of non-humans for human purposes and continues to allow us to treat non-human animals and other forms of nature in often abominable ways.
 
 This thesis investigates two situations in which wildlife tourism occurs in Australia. Fraser Island and Penguin Island are two wildlife tourism destinations on opposite sides of the continent with very different wildlife but some very similar issues. From these two contexts data was collected through interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and from literary and documentary sources. Understanding the empirical data collected from these case studies is facilitated through a social constructionist view of discourse analysis that allows an unpacking of the messages and a stance from which to challenge the dominant ideologies that frame management and interaction.
 
 In the thesis I demonstrate that anthropology, in its incarnation as environmental anthropology and as a team player in a necessarily interdisciplinary approach to understanding and resolving environmental issues, has much to offer. This engagement has the potential to enhance not only the sustainable future of naturebased activities like wildlife tourism but also the relevance of anthropology in the postcolonial contemporary world.
 
 The need for a holistic framework encompassing all the stakeholders in any wildlife tourism venture is proposed. This approach to wildlife tourism is best serviced by examining perspectives, values and concerns of all members of the wildlife tourism community at any given destination. It is only through this type of holistic and situated focus that we can hope to effectively understand, and then manage, in the best interests of all parties.
 
 More specifically, and finally, I argue for a rethinking of the way wildlife tourism interactions are managed in some settings. The ideology of separation, enacted both conceptually and physically to create maintain boundaries, is demonstrated through the two case studies and the ways in which interactions between humans and wildlife are currently managed. An alternative is posed, that by reconstructing management in settings where wildlife tourists may be more accepting of their own responsibility towards nature, a model can be developed that allows people and wildlife to co-exist without &#8216;killing&#8217; the natural instincts of either.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/714/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth mentoring and adult-youth relationships: The importance of context</field><field name="creator">Brooker, Miriam</field><field name="description">This study is about programmes that foster adult-youth relationships and more specifically about the community context necessary for such programmes to flourish.   The study is designed to explore a faith-based community context in which a youth mentoring programme is being considered as a strategy to help develop adult-youth relationships and youth participation in the community.  The focus of this research is an Anglican parish in Perth, Western Australia.  The study evaluates whether mentoring would be the most appropriate adult-youth programme intervention to facilitate parish ministry to its young people.  
 
 Three literatures related to formal adult-youth programmes including youth mentoring, intergenerational and youth-adult partnerships inform the study.  Key programme characteristics and theoretical models related to the three literatures are identified, as well as recommended practices or behaviours associated with the development of effective adult-youth relationships.
   
 The study methodology emphasises wide consultation and elicits the perceptions and expectations of participants regarding youth mentoring and youth participation.  Illuminative evaluation, action research and mixed methods approaches are integrated and combined within the study, incorporating a range of data sources to be compared and contrasted to identify adult and youth needs and to produce recommendations pertinent to the parish context.  A sociocultural approach to data analysis and interpretation, as outlined by Barbara Rogoff, is employed to foreground interpersonal relationships in the parish whilst also considering individual and cultural-institutional planes of analysis.  
   
 Youth participation is identified to be an adult need given the anxiety of many study participants about the future of the parish and their valuing of a community incorporating all age groups.  Despite generally positive participant expectations of mentoring as an intervention, study findings indicate that a formal youth-adult activity programme would be more likely to respond to the needs of all young people connected to the parish.  Mentoring is identified to be one potential form of youth-adult activity that could be included, as well as being a form of relationship that could develop naturally.  The study includes four main recommendations regarding preparatory activities intended to support the design and implementation of an effective parish adult-youth programme: (1) Address barriers to communication between youth and adults; (2) Be aware of power differences between adults and youth; (3) Be open to supporting youth initiated change; and (4) Develop a shared vision for youth participation in the parish.  Overall, lessons learned from the youth mentoring, intergenerational and adult-youth partnership literatures suggest that a focus on mutuality and reciprocity between youth and adults is most beneficial for the development of ongoing relationships.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/715/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photography and reflection: A study exploring perceptions of first year nursing students towards older persons</field><field name="creator">Brand, Gabrielle</field><field name="description">This qualitative exploratory study sought to explore and analyse the perceptions of first year nursing students aged 18-25 years toward older persons in aged care facilities.  The expectations of first year nursing students in relation to performing nursing care on older persons was also examined. The students&#8217; perceptions were explored using a photo-elicitation technique to evoke an emotive response. By challenging and confronting the participants with realistic photographs of nursing care, this technique encouraged the research participants to engage in anticipatory reflection prior to their first aged care clinical placement.  
 
 Data were gathered through demographic questionnaires and semi-structured photo-elicitation interviews.  Findings were analysed using thematic analysis.  Themes included dissecting what it means to be a nurse, recognising dependence, and the re-visioning of therapeutic relationships including considering patient dignity and empathising with older persons.  A youthful reflection on the differences between young and old included participants&#8217; fearing for themselves in future, and this was another identified theme.  The photo-elicitation technique challenged and confronted participants as they became aware of the responsibilities of performing nursing care and their belief that they lacked emotional preparedness.  Experiencing sensitivity and awkwardness to nakedness of older person&#8217;s bodies was also highlighted by most of the participants&#8217; responses.
 
 The findings suggest that it is essential in this time of demographic change and the growing ageing population that nursing education responds to the challenge of an evolving health care system by providing qualified, experienced aged care nurses who are familiar with the reality of older people. Therefore, first year nursing students&#8217; transition to aged care nursing clinical placement and the adoption of positive attitudes is paramount. Despite a large number of research studies highlighting nursing students&#8217; disinterest in caring for older persons, there have been few studies investigating educational interventions that could assist in overcoming this negative trend.  
 
 The findings from this study have important implications for teaching strategies aimed at understanding undergraduate nursing students.  Using photography to elicit emotional responses can also assist with reflective practice, which can be useful to enhance self awareness and an aesthetic and personal knowing.   Encouraging anticipatory reflection can help socially prepare nursing students, increase their readiness for learning and foster more positive attitudes to caring for older people prior to the students&#8217; initial aged care clinical placement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/716/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic interaction in anorexia nervosa treatment</field><field name="creator">Bellair (nee Dunn), Rachael</field><field name="description">Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic and complex psychosomatic condition, characterised by a primary drive to be thin and a refusal to maintain normal body weight. Only a minority of people diagnosed with AN ever become asymptomatic and more research has been called for to address high drop-out rates and lack of engagement in AN treatment services, in particular psychotherapeutic treatment. Prior studies have generally examined this problem in terms of patient mediated variables, such as attitudes and behaviours, with little focus on contextual factors. Research that has studied therapeutic engagement in the area of AN has yet to examine psychotherapeutic treatments-in-practice. Guided by this gap in the literature this thesis examines ways in which therapists engage with adolescents diagnosed with AN in naturally occurring psychotherapeutic interactions. A secondary and concurrent focus is to look at how the therapists&#8217; underlying theoretical models are reflected in in situ practice. The data corpus comprises twenty-four therapy sessions recorded in an eating disorders programme based in a children&#8217;s hospital. In contrast to eating disorders treatment statistics reported in the literature, the programme has a low drop-out rate, zero mortality rate and good long-term patient outcomes, making it an especially suitable setting to examine engagement.
 
 Drawing on methods from discursive psychology (DP) and conversation analysis (CA), a number of interactional practices are found which show how the key principles of engagement and neutrality are brought off, or achieved as such in turn-by-turn interaction. Central to the analysis, is the recurrent production of patients&#8217; bodily states and conduct as delicate items. As these topics are also the primary focus of the institutional setting, the analysis shows how practices such as perspective display series and dispositional management allow delicately marked institutional tasks to be carried out. The analysis also examines how patients&#8217; bodies and conduct are embedded in, and constituted as problematic in the interactions. Regularities, such as agentic repositioning in accounts, demonstrate the co-production of patients as psychologically compliant with treatment while physically non-compliant.  
 
 This thesis contributes to work in applied CA concerning links between theoretical models and interactional practices by demonstrating naturally occurring regularities that describe key guiding principles of the eating disorders programme. It also builds on work in DP concerning examinations of the body and embodiment, by showing how patients&#8217; physical bodies are an integrated feature of the interactions. Finally, this thesis has implications for a clinical audience in terms of extending therapists&#8217; awareness of how engagement with patients is constituted interactionally, which also contributes to wider AN literature on &#8216;resistance&#8217; to therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/717/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of tools for surveillance of Coxiella burnetii in domestic ruminants and Australian marsupials and their waste</field><field name="creator">Banazis, Michael</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to develop improved methods to detect viable Coxiella burnetii in wastes from livestock production.  The impetus for this work arose because there is a significant risk of infection for humans attributed to contact with waste products from the livestock production industry.  This situation is further compounded by the lack of suitable tools to detect viable C. burnetii in these wastes.  In addition, effective disinfection strategies for livestock wastes are also required to reduce the risk of infection with C. burnetii for individuals that come into contact with these waste products.
 
 A quantitative real-time PCR system (qPCR) with high sensitivity and specificity was developed to detect the C. burnetii in environmental samples associated with domestic ruminants and native Australian marsupials.  Different detection chemistries and procedures were evaluated based on their sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility.  Overall it was found that the TaqMan PCR targeting the IS1111a locus provided the most sensitive and reproducible test.  The Geneworks PowerSoil(tm) DNA isolation kit provided the best compromise between reproducibility and recovery of DNA from livestock wastes.  When combined, the IS1111a TaqMan qPCR and Geneworks PowerSoil DNA Extraction Kit provided a test which was capable of detecting as few as two C. burnetii genome equivalents in 0.2g of soil or faeces.
 
 Coxiella burnetii has been shown to display extreme resistance to environmental exposure.  Therefore, assessment of the viability of the organism in environmental matrices is more useful for risk assessment programs than detection of DNA alone.  A quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was developed that was able to detect viable C. burnetii cells in soil.  The sensitivity of the assay was enhanced by heat-treating the soil samples prior to extraction of RNA.
 
 The factor most often associated with transfer of C. burnetii to humans is exposure to livestock or their waste.  Therefore, decontamination of waste from livestock production industries is a key factor in preventing outbreaks of Q fever.  A system was developed to determine the efficacy of various disinfectant treatments against the environmental pathogen C. burnetii.  Treatments evaluated included sodium hypochlorite, ozone, ultraviolet light, peracetic acid (PAA), and Virkon S&#174;.  Sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 0.1 mM reduced the infectivity of C. burnetii by over 92% while treatment with the same sodium hypochlorite concentration in wastewater showed significantly reduced efficacy.  Despite this reduced potency, sodium hypochlorite is still useful for control of C. burnetii in the liquid waste of animal production.
 
 Commercially available ELISA and CFT assays exist for ruminants but there are no immunological tests available for detecting C. burnetii in marsupials even though Australian marsupials are known to be susceptible to C. burnetii.  An indirect ELISA for detecting anti-Coxiella antibodies in kangaroos was developed.  Paired serum and faecal samples were taken from 379 ruminants from Western Australia and the serum was tested with a commercially available ELISA and the complement fixation test while the faeces was tested using the qPCR developed during this study.  Paired serum and faecal samples were taken from 343 kangaroos from WA and were tested with the antibody-ELISA developed during this study and by qPCR. A very low prevalence of anti-Coxiella antibodies was observed in the ruminants sampled and results from immunological tests correlated poorly with qPCR data.  The development of an ELISA for use with kangaroo serum was problematic because of the lack of reference sera from animals known to be infected with C. burnetii.  Despite this results from the ELISA developed suggested that the apparent seroprevalence in the WA animals surveyed was approximately 34%.  Results from testing kangaroo faeces with the qPCR correlated poorly with the results from the antibody-ELISA.  These data suggest that kangaroos may be a significant reservoir of C. burnetii in Western Australia and due to cohabitation of kangaroos and domestic ruminants, may provide a link between the wildlife and domestic cycles of C. burnetii.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/718/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes toward sexuality in the Book of Ben Sira</field><field name="creator">Balla, Ibolya</field><field name="description">The fact that Ben Sira seemingly has a negative attitude towards women or femininity can easily lead to the assumption that the work has a negative attitude toward sexuality. However, this thesis will seek to demonstrate that the author's view on sexuality is complex, subtle, and depends on the context of the individual sayings. First of all we have to make a distinction between the attitudes of the writer of the original Hebrew text of the book and that of the Greek translator. The two texts, produced in different social settings, circumstances, times and places, differ substantially at times in regard to sexuality. Therefore it is essential to treat them separately and to compare them. In addition, the Book of Ben Sira, the longest Jewish wisdom book, is a complex combination of carefully composed wisdom poems that structure the whole work, and of teachings on everyday issues including marriage, family life, self-control, desires and passions, and sexual promiscuity. The openness about issues of eroticism that characterizes some of the poems concerning personified female wisdom is unprecedented in the wisdom writings of Second Temple Judaism. Similarly, the sage dedicates a greater number of passages than other wisdom books, to the discussion of social relations especially in regard to family. In so doing his regular point of departure seems to be what benefits or damages these relations mean, and whether they bring disgrace to a person, especially through sexuality. These all have bearings on the author&#8217;s and translator&#8217;s views of sexuality, including the position a person or situation under discussion might have in the sage&#8217;s social value system. Therefore the thesis examines the wisdom poems, and all sayings that concern sexuality found in discussions of passions, relations with parents, daughters and sons, wives and husbands, and warnings against sexual wrongdoing, including prostitution and adultery. All this is done with a special regard to the differences between the Hebrew original text and the Greek translation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/719/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of amending bauxite residue sands with residue fines for the establishment of vegetation on residue disposal areas</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Jonathan</field><field name="description">Long term storage of bauxite residue materials requires a capping stratum which will limit erosion while stabilizing slopes, limit deep infiltration of water into storage piles, and be aesthetically acceptable to the surrounding community. A diverse native vegetative community capable of surviving seasonal drought, low plant available water and nutrient constraints has the best potential of satisfying most, if not all of these requirements. Current and past rehabilitation of residue disposal areas (RDAs) using species native to southwest Western Australia has exhibited varying success. Current practices at Alcoa World Alumina Australia&#8217;s (Alcoa) Western Australia refineries have bauxite residue fines (&lt; 150 &#236;m) stored within impoundments, in which the outer embankments are constructed with bauxite residue sands (&gt; 150 &#236;m). The residue sands are also used as the growth media in the capping stratum for vegetation establishment on the disposal sites. Despite the inherently hostile properties of residue sand (pH &gt; 10, EC(1:5) &gt; 4 dS m-1, and ESP &gt; 50), reductions in alkalinity (pH), salinity (EC) and sodicity (ESP) are corrected, through freshwater leaching, to a greater extent than is possible with residue fines. Although leaching can reduce the hostile character of residue sand, additions of phosphogypsum are typically added to expedite the removal of Na and alkalinity, and inorganic fertilizers are incorporated to improve the nutrient status of the growth media. However, due to the inconsistencies in vegetation establishment, which are attributed to poor water retention, inherent nutrient deficiencies and rapid loss of nutrients within residue sands (because of high hydraulic conductivity), further amendments are required.
 
 The aim of this study was to determine if amending the residue sand capping layer with residue fines would enhance its overall growth potential for vegetation establishment. Additions of fines to residue sands were predicted to increase water retention, add nutrients and increase the ability of the growth media to retain nutrients.  Comparisons were made between the treated residue fines (seawater washed, carbonated, or unaltered) at a series of fines additions (1 - 20 % w/w) and a control(residue sand) amended with 2% (w/w) phosphogypsum and inorganic fertilizer.
 
 Comparisons were to determine the differences in 1) water retention, 2) nutrient concentrations and nutrient retention, and 3) plant growth responses and plant biomass nutrient concentrations between the growth media treatments. Four experiments were set up to measure differences in these variables which included: a glasshouse study involving the growth of Acacia saligna; a germination and emergence study (A.saligna); a two year field study in Western Australia; and a glasshouse column leaching study.
 
 Water retention increased with increasing percentage of residue fines addition. Plant available water (PAW) increased up to 110 %, with a 20 % increase in fines, representing an increase of 0.026 m3 PAW m-3 residue growth media, when compared to the residue sand only. This increase in PAW was attributed to changes in pore space distributions, due to the increasing fines contents altering the sandy texture to loamy sand texture class. However, initially much of this increase in PAW may not be realized, due to estimated temporary increases in osmotic potential associated with the high salt contents of residue sand and fines. Fines materials have much greater salt contents, and thus need to be leached to a greater extent than sands to remove the associated osmotic potential effects.
 
 Essential plant nutrients (P, K, S, Ca, Mg, and B) were increased with additions of residue fines in the glasshouse studies, although many nutrients (Mg, Zn, Mn and B) were still marginal for sustainable plant growth and development. Seawater treated residue fines additions produced the greatest increases in growth media nutrients with substantial increases in soluble (&gt; 7 mg L-1) and exchangeable (&gt; 0.10 cmolc kg-1) Mg, being up to 400 % greater than all other treatments. Along with these necessary nutrients, concentrations of Na were also increased in all fines additions treatments. Added Na may offset the benefits of fines additions, at least in the short term, due to inhibitions of cation uptake from Na competition. However, in the column leaching study soluble and exchangeable Na was lost rapidly from the profile, due to Ca and K displacement of Na from exchange sites during leaching. Soluble Na was removed from the profile to &lt; 5 % of initial concentrations, after only three pore volumes of leaching, and exchangeable Na was removed from charge sites to less than 25 % of the initial concentration. Fines additions did increase concentrations of Mg and K on exchange sites, thus reflecting increased nutrient retention capacity relative to that in residue sand only.
 
 Plant growth responses and plant biomass nutrient concentrations were altered with the additions of residue fines to residue sands. The germination and emergence study demonstrated that the emergence of native seedlings was affected by additions of fines, due to the increased salinity and sodicity of the materials. Acacia saligna seedling emergence was inhibited by EC(1:5) &gt; 2 dS m-1, which was highly correlated with a Na/Ca ratio of &gt; 40, for all treatments, except the seawater fines additions. Seeds sown in seawater treatments emerged from growth media with EC(1:5) as high as 3.33 dS m-1 and appeared to be better correlated with Ca/Mg ratios than any other variable. Native vegetation growth responses showed mixed results in fines treated residues in the field. In the greenhouse study, plant growth tended to decrease with fines additions. Poor plant growth with increasing fines additions occurred despite the increased water retention and increased nutrients. This was attributed to the addition of Na associated with the residue fines, as increases in Na, EC and ESP in fines treatments all appear to have limited growth of Acacia saligna in the glasshouse over three months. Seawater fines additions had elevated Mg and B concentrations in plant biomass, and performed better than the carbonated or unaltered fines treatments, but still had reduced growth compared to the residue sand, which contained lower Na concentrations. Additional plant growth limitations may have occurred, due to possible plant nutrient deficiencies including: Mg, Zn, Mn and B and Na toxicity.
 
 Incorporation of residue fines into residue sands did increase water retention, nutrient concentrations and the nutrient retention capacity, but did not enhance the overall growth potential for vegetation, at least in the short term. Reductions in germination and emergence of seedlings and reduced plant growth were attributed to increases in Na concentrations introduced from the fines. Seawater washed residue fines had lower ESP and greater concentrations of nutrients, thus reducing the negative impacts from the additional Na introduced, and showed the greatest promise as a fines amendment. As leaching occurs over the first few initial months of rehabilitation, it is expected that the majority of the Na will be removed, from a system with an addition of 5 to 10 % fines, and the positive benefits of the fines additions will than be realized. Findings also illustrate that delaying the planting of vegetation on RDAs, until adequate leaching has occurred to reduce the Na concentrations, will substantially increase vegetation emergence and establishment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/720/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High strength in-situ biocementation of soil by calcite precipitating locally isolated ureolytic bacteria</field><field name="creator">Al-Thawadi, Salwa</field><field name="description">This study has contributed to the patented technology of biocement (Microbial Biocementation, WO/2006/066326). Biocementation or biogrout is a sand consolidation technology, in which the carbonate released from microbial urea hydrolysis precipitates with an excess of calcium ions to form in-situ calcite (CaCO3) precipitation. Under the right conditions this can result in soil solidification and has found significant commercial interest.
 
 This study has enriched and isolated highly urease active bacteria, particularly suitable for the fermentation process. Six strains with different properties relevant for biocementation were isolated. The most urease active strain (strain MCP11) produced sufficient urease to allow the use of the non-concentrated cell suspension for biocementation experiments. Activities and specific activities were 11-28 mM urea hydrolysed.min-1 and 2.2-5.6 mM urea hydrolysed.min-1.OD-1 respectively. A separate strain (strain MCP4) showed spontaneous flocculation at the end of the batch growth, showing its increased tendency to attach to surfaces. This can be useful for effective cell concentration and for improved attachment during the cementation process.
 
 The possibility of causing cementation by using enrichments rather than pure strains has been documented. This may allow a cheaper production of the urease than by traditional pure culture processes.
 
 Urease production was optimised by increasing the concentration of yeast extract and the addition of Ni2+ ions to the growth media, resulting in increasing urease activity as the reproducible urease yield. This was accomplished by the addition of 10 &#956;M Ni 2+ ions and increasing the level of yeast extract to 20 g.L-1
 
 Some of the isolated strains were suitable for biocementation process producing mechanical strength (&#8805; 0.6 MPa) within several hours depending on the rate of urea conversion. This mechanical strength enhancement of the cemented columns was performed without a large decrease in the permeability.
 
 The formation of CaCO3 crystals in the presence of high concentration of calcium and urea was monitored. This crystal growth was monitored over time by video recording the ureolytic reaction on a microscopic slide. The crystals also were examined through SEM. It was found that two types of CaCO3 precipitates were formed; these precipitates were calcite rhombohedral crystals and spheroids. Video clips showed that the rhombohedral crystals originated from the spheroids. These spheroids were fragile, not stable and were considered to be vaterite.
 
 This study suggested that the strength of the cemented column was caused mostly due to the point-to-point contacts of rhombohedral CaCO3 crystals and adjacent sand grains.
 
 A method of producing high strength cemented samples from sand was developed. This method first attaches the cells into the sand-column by growing them in the presence of calcium ions as little as 6 mM. Then, the cells were incubated in-situ for about 48 hours to enable attachment to the surface of the sand granules. Then the cells were reused over 20-times by continuous supply of cementation solution (equi-molar concentration of calcium and urea). This method produced a mechanical strength of up to 30 MPa, which is equivalent to construction cement.
 
 The mechanical strength could be increased by supplying the bacteria in-situ with a food source and 10 &#956;M Ni2+ ions, allowing some measures of reaction rate control in-situ. To our knowledge, this study was the first study to use biological cementation to produce strength comparable to that of traditional cemented construction materials such as sandstone and concrete.
 
 The key factors for the optimal CaCO3 precipitation (strength production) in-situ were examined. It was found that in-situ urease activity was the key factor for strength production. The maximum in-situ urease activity was achieved by supplementing the cementation solution with growth media, and the use of 0.5 M urea and Ca2+ as cementation solution. The in-situ urease activity differed according to the different bacterial strains which tolerated the cementation conditions differently.
 
 One of the advantages of the present study was that cementation of porous media could be achieved without clogging the injection end. The injection end could be clogged by CaCO3 precipitation due to cementation reaction (cells, calcium and urea). By sequentially flushing the cells and cementation solution, clogging of the injection end could be avoided and high penetration depth was achieved as long as there was sufficient passage of cementation solution. Uniform cementation along 1 m packed sand-column was obtained. This uniformity was confirmed by the urease activity measurement, calcite precipitation and mechanical strength production. For finer sand, homogenous cementation proved more difficult.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/721/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diminished subject: An exploration into the aporia of the condition of the possibility of change as represented in twentieth century philosophy and contemporary literature</field><field name="creator">Bishop, Geoffrey David</field><field name="description">This thesis acts as an exploration of the notion of an a priori aporia of the always already diminished subject as opposed to an ideal self-present individual, and explores the efforts of a selection of twentieth century continental philosophy to address the crises of scepticism and metaphysics that beset this tradition and its search for the &#8216;truth&#8217; of being. I will argue that my atemporal philosophical teleology proves in fact that any attempt to determine the finitude of subjectivity represents an ineluctable desire for metaphysical comfort that can, at times, verge on totalitarianism. Furthermore, the divergent temporal loci of these theorists &#8212; and their particular attempts to address these recurrent crises &#8212; necessarily calls into question the popular perception of a temporally specific &#8216;postmodern condition&#8217; afflicting the contemporary subject.
 
 Given the repeated failure of philosophical discourse to provide the subject with its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre, a focus on the usefulness of literature in this regard becomes apparent within my theoretical schema, leading to a discussion of several controversial contemporary novels that parallel my proposition of the diminished subject, and refute negative perceptions of them as postmodern and valueless due to an apparent nihilistic &#8216;anything goes&#8217; attitude. However, rather than resorting to na&#239;ve utopianism regarding the positive uses of literature, I argue that these texts reiterate the key theoretical propositions in this thesis with an awareness of the discursive nature of the subject and the a priori condition of the possibility of change which inevitably undermine transcendence. It is my proposition that these texts can be read as fictionalised expressions of the cathartic possibilities of literature, and an innate desire in all subjects for the metaphysics of comfort when faced with the meaninglessness of existence, something exacerbated by the recurrent failure of philosophical and religious discourses to counter the aporia of an always already absent self-presence of subjectivity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/722/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Faith, race and strategy:  Japanese-Mongolian relations, 1873-1945</field><field name="creator">Boyd, James Graham</field><field name="description">Between 1873 and 1945 Japan and Mongolia had a complex and important relationship that has been largely overlooked in post-war studies of Japan&#8217;s imperial era.  In fact, Japanese-Mongolian relations in the modern period provide a rich field of enquiry into the nature of Japanese imperialism as well as further evidence of the complexity of Japan&#8217;s relationships with other Asian countries in the decades before 1945.  This thesis examines the relationship from the Japanese perspective, drawing on a diverse range of contemporary materials, both official and unofficial, including military documents, government reports, travel guides and academic works, many of which have been neglected in earlier studies.  In previous analyses, the strategic dimension has been seen as overwhelming and Mongolia has often been regarded as merely a minor addendum to Japan&#8217;s relationship with Manchuria.  In fact, however, Japan&#8217;s connection with Mongolia itself was a crucial part of its interaction with the Chinese continent from the 1870s to 1945.  Though undeniably coveted for strategic reasons, Mongolia also offered unparalleled opportunities for the elaboration of all the major aspects of the discourses that made up Japan&#8217;s evolving claim to solidarity with and leadership of Asia.  It also functioned as a showcase for Japan&#8217;s supposedly benevolent intentions towards Asia.  In some ways, moreover, the relationship with Mongolia was presented as distinctive, particularly because of the common faith in Buddhism and a supposedly shared ancestry in ethnic terms.  In turn, the military, political, ideological and cultural opportunities apparently provided by Mongolia account for the wide range of groups and individuals in Japan that developed Mongolian connections and for the often close relations between these groups and individuals on the one hand, and the most powerful institutions of the Japanese state on the other.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/723/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fighting for the forests: a history of the Western Australian forest protest movement 1895-2001</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Ron</field><field name="description">As the first comprehensive study of Western Australian forest protest the thesis analyses the protest movement's organisation, campaigns and strategies. Its central argument is that the contemporary Western Australian forest protest movement established a network of urban and south-west activist groups which encouraged broad public support, and that a diversity of protest strategies focused public attention on forest issues and pressured the state government to change its forest policies.   The forest protest movement was characterised by its ability to continually adapt its organisation and strategies to changing social and political conditions.  This flexible approach to protest not only led to victories in the Shannon River Basin, Lane-Poole Reserve and old growth forest campaigns, but also transformed forest protest into an influential social movement which contributed to the downfall of the Court Liberal Government in 2001.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/724/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia's north-west : a study of exploration, land policy and land acquisition, 1644-1884</field><field name="creator">Clement, Cathie</field><field name="description">The thesis analyses the continuum of European activity that preceded establishment of an effective pastoral industry in Australia's north-west. Two strands - physical activity and evolution of legislation - are interwoven, examining growth in geographical knowledge, proposals for colonisation and the outcome of interplay between government officials and landholders over land policy.
 
 Growth in geographical knowledge gave rise to colonisation proposals from 1828. The thesis relates these proposals to events affecting northern Australia to show that promotion and occupation of north-west lands constituted an integral part of the outgrowth of colonial settlement in Australia.
 
 Europeans occupied the north-west in two waves, abortively during the 1860s and continuously from 1879. The existing literature identifies these waves but provides inadequate analysis of events to 1884. The thesis fills this gap by showing that land hunger, misinformation, land speculation, manipulation of legislation and exploitation of political power for private commercial gain determined the shape of north-west settlement. Moreover, by relating land policy to tenure and occupation, it shows that private individuals influenced land policy and impeded official plans for rapid settlement. Thus, the thesis provides a fresh perspective not only on the prelude to effective pastoral settlement in the north-west but on the management of Western Australia's outlying lands in the period before responsible government.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/725/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pain, motion sickness and migraine: effects on symptoms and scalp blood flow</field><field name="creator">Cuomo-Granston, Anna</field><field name="description">Migraine, a neurovascular disorder, is associated with disturbances in brain stem activity during attacks.    Interictal persistence of these disturbances might increase vulnerability to recurrent attacks of migraine.   To explore this possibility, effects of motion sickness and pain on migrainous symptoms and extracranial vascular reponses were investigated in 27 migraine sufferers in the headache-free interval, and 23 healthy age/sex matched controls.  
 
 Symptoms of migraine and motion sickness are remarkably similar.  As both maladies involve reflexes that relay in the brain stem, they most probably share the same neural circuitry.  Furthermore, migraineurs are usually susceptible to motion sickness and, conversely, motion sickness-prone individuals commonly experience migraine.   Participants in the present study were exposed to optokinetic stimulation (OKS), a well-established way of inducing symptoms of motion sickness in susceptible individuals.
   
 Sensitivity to painful stimulation of the head and hand was also explored.  Head pain is a hallmark of a migraine attack and cutaneous allodynia has been observed elsewhere in the body during attacks.  The trigeminal nerve is associated with head pain in migraine, and trigeminal activity evokes reflexes that relay in the brain stem.  To stimulate the trigeminal nerve, ice was applied to the temple.  To stimulate nociceptors elsewhere in the body the participant immersed their fingers and palm in ice-water.
 
 Procedures used in this study were physically stressful and probably psychologically stressful.    The impact of stress in relation to the development of symptomatic and vascular responses, particularly anticipatory stress-responses, was explored.
 
 This research involved one central experiment that consisted of six experimental conditions. On separate occasions participants were exposed to optokinetic stimulation and painful stimulation of the head or limb, individually and in combination.  
 
 In migraine sufferers, symptomatic responses were enhanced during all procedures involving OKS and during temple pain after OKS, in the presence of residual motion sickness.  During trigeminal stimulation independent of OKS, headache initially developed followed by nausea as the procedure progressed.  In contrast, symptoms barely developed in controls during any of the six procedures except for slight dizziness, self-motion and visual-illusion during conditions involving OKS, and slight nausea when the temple was painfully stimulated during OKS and during OKS alone.  Trigeminal stimulation during OKS intensified nausea and headache in migraine sufferers compared to during OKS alone or limb pain during OKS.  However, the remaining symptomatic ratings were not affected by temple pain during OKS, suggesting a specific association between nausea and head pain.  It may be that these cardinal symptoms compound one another during a migraine attack.    Enhanced symptomatic responses in migraine sufferers during the headache interval may indicate activation of hypersensitive neural pathways that mediate symptoms of motion sickness or migraine.  Migraineurs found procedures generally more unpleasant, and ice-induced pain ratings more intense and unpleasant, than controls, which may further indicate hyperexcitable nociception in this group, or a difference in their criterion of discomfort.
 
 Vascular responses, particularly during OKS alone, and during painful stimulation independent of OKS, were greater in migraine sufferers than in controls.   The added stress of painful stimulation during OKS appeared to boost facial blood flow in controls to approach levels obtained in migraine sufferers.   Enhanced vasodilatation was observed in migraineurs prior to painful stimulation, presumably due to anticipatory anxiety.  
           
 For both groups ipsilateral vascular responses were greater than contralateral responses when the hand was painfully stimulated.    During limb pain before OKS asymmetry was minimal in migraine sufferers but more apparent in controls.  An enhanced stress response in migraineurs may have drawn ipsilateral and contralateral responses closer together.
 
 The development of symptoms during the procedures of this study provides an insight into how symptoms might develop sequentially in a migraine attack.  Once the headache is in motion, nausea and headache may mutually exacerbate one another.  In turn, trigemino-vascular responses and stress appear to be associated with the migraine crisis.  Given the interactive nature of symptomatic, vascular, and stress responses, it may be more effective to target multiple, rather than individual, symptoms, in prophylactic or acute chemical and psychological interventions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/726/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crime and punishment on the Western Front: the Australian Imperial Force and British Army discipline</field><field name="creator">Garstang, Edward John</field><field name="description">The Australian Imperial Force in the First World War had a deserved reputation as an effective fighting force, and at the same had the worst disciplinary record away from the frontline when compared with other Dominion forces and the rest of the British Army. Australian indiscipline is a subject that has been largely ignored, or when dealt with as in the Official History by C. E. W. Bean, has had to pass through the filter of the Australian Legend. This study examines the link between Australian indiscipline and the privileged position they held of being the only force immune from the death penalty, except for mutiny, desertion to the enemy and traitorous activity. This simple fact would have a major influence on the relatively high numbers of absentees and desertions within Australian ranks. General Headquarters in France (GHQ) saw these high levels of indiscipline as a direct result of Australian authorities not allowing their soldiers to be placed under the Army Act in full. Further differences surfaced between the British and Australians when it came to punishment, with Australian courts criticised by British Army authorities for not using the powers they possessed to impose penalties that would act as a deterrent, as well as their reluctance to impose Field Punishment No. 1. This study examines these general differences as well as dealing with a specific case of an Australian soldier charged with the murder of a French civilian, a case that attracted the attention of senior political and military figures when it transpired Australians were immune from the death penalty for murder. Maintaining discipline was a constant struggle for the authorities when faced with those determined to avoid frontline duty either by committing military crime or through self-maiming. In this context the high venereal disease rate is discussed and evidence presented that this could be considered as a self-inflicted wound. The mutiny in the 1st Battalion of September 1918 is examined as well as a mutiny in a military prison in France in 1919. It is not the purpose of this study to tarnish the reputation of the many thousands of brave men who fought in the AIF, rather it is an attempt to understand the high levels of indiscipline within the context of the war on the Western Front and the disciplinary code under which they operated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/728/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is Kierkegaard's radical faith a defensible justification for religious belief?</field><field name="creator">Gn, Peter, Hoong Siong</field><field name="description">Fideism, or basing one&#8217;s religious belief on faith, is popular especially amongst modern Protestant Christians. For the fideist, religious belief-systems are not subject to rational evaluation, and faith as the act of belief forms the essence of truth and the ultimate criterion for embracing a religion. Critics of fideism say that epistemologically, a hierarchy of methods can be used to derive the truth, and each method gives us varying confidence levels. These methods include mathematics and logic, science, personal experience, history, expert testimony, inference and Faith. Among these, the critic says, pure faith in something is the least successful in getting at the truth. Radical fideists like Kierkegaard do not cite logical reasons for defending their belief that God exists. Personal reasons are instead offered for their decision to believe. In this thesis I seek to demonstrate that the radical fideism advocated by Kierkegaard constitutes good justification for belief in the Christian God. I will begin with a discussion on fideism and some of its proponents, followed by a discussion on the place of faith (as a non-rational belief in God&#8217;s existence) in religion. I will then appeal to Kierkegaard&#8217;s philosophy in defending my view that religious belief in God is a matter of faith and personal commitment, feeling and passion, and this is an inner process not grounded in arguments. References will be drawn from Kierkegaard&#8217;s themes of faith, subjectivity and inwardness. I conclude by saying that even if no objective grounds exist to justify our belief, Kierkegaard standpoint remains right in two ways: Firstly, the fideist rejection of the attempt to justify his belief through offering reasons for it is precisely what makes his decision to believe deeply meaningful in his life. Secondly, those who &#8216;try to judge faith by objective, critical reflection will go on forever that way, and will never reach the point of having faith and of being religious&#8217;.

Risk management at the fringes of the global order</field><field name="creator">Hameiri, Shahar</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a new framework for explaining the effects and possible trajectories of state building interventions (SBIs). This is for both examining specific interventions and learning about the precise nature of the post-Cold War global order &#8211; how power is distributed, exercised, constrained and challenged within and between states.
 
 In the post-Cold War years, but particularly since the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks, so-called failed states have become a central security concern for policymakers. In tandem, there has been an influx of practitioner and scholarly interest in international &#8216;state building&#8217;. Prevalent approaches to state building are premised on a static conception of the state and therefore seek to evaluate SBIs in terms of whether they help create &#8216;more&#8217; or &#8216;less&#8217; state. In contrast, this thesis examines SBIs as a new mode of governance in the global political economy that is transformative of both intervened and intervening states, leading to the creation of a transnationalising and transnationally regulated form of statehood. Based on a conception of the state as a site of social and political struggle this study examines the ways in which SBIs affect the distribution, production and reproduction of political power in intervened states: Who rules and how? What social and political conflicts are engendered or exacerbated by SBIs, and how are they managed? What alliances and coalitions support the production/reproduction of power relationships associated with SBIs?
 
 The thesis provides a conceptual framework for understanding the complex governance terrain SBIs open up. SBIs are conceptualised as multilevel regimes &#8211; sets of social and political relationships, institutions and ideas &#8211; that exist simultaneously within and outside intervened states. While preserving the formal sovereignty of intervened states, these regimes are nevertheless established to shape political outcomes by limiting the political choices available to domestic leaders. This is operationalised by opening up and shifting power to multilevel spaces of governance within the apparatus of these countries. Through case studies from Australia, Solomon Islands and Cambodia, the thesis analyses the politics of SBIs and their broader implications for contemporary statehood. Ultimately it establishes that regardless of whether SBIs are successful or otherwise in achieving their stated objectives they are associated with the emergence of increasingly authoritarian, hierarchical and anti-competitive forms of political rule, both within and between states.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/730/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Latent equine herpesvirus infections in horses</field><field name="creator">Hamzah, Hazilawati</field><field name="description">A significant characteristic of the herpesviruses is that they form latent infections in infected hosts, and can be reactivated to again induce lytic infections by stressors.  This thesis deals with an epidemiological investigation of equine herpesvirus infection, particularly gammaherpesvirus infections, in foals and if there was evidence of reactivation of latent virus infections by stressors such as those associated with weaning.
 
 A longitudinal study of EHV infections in young foals and the effect of stressors such as weaning on the prevalence of virus infection was undertaken by the detection of DNA and mRNA of EHV2, EHV5, EHV1 and EHV4 in peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) and nasal swabs (NS) from 13 mares and 46 foals in 4 stables.  EHV2 and EHV5 infections were detected commonly in the study population but infections with the alphaherpesviruses EHV1 and EHV4 were not detected, although lytic infections by the alphaherpesviruses may have been missed due to the frequency of sampling.  Age differences in the prevalence of EHV2 and EHV5 infection were detected: the prevalence of EHV2 was higher in young foals than in older foals and adult animals; the prevalence of EHV5 was higher in older foals and adults than in younger foals.  The prevalence of EHV2 and EHV5 infection increased in association with weaning, presumably in association with stressors associated with weaning, but was not clearly associated with disease in the weaned animals.  It was also observed that EHV5 produced a transient lytic infection in PBL of young foals but tended to produce a persistent lytic infection of PBL in older foals and adults.  Persistent lytic EHV5 infections of &#161;&#221;37 weeks duration were also detected in 2 of 13 adult mares and this has not been reported previously.  The persistent lytic infection of PBL was not associated with the detection of virus in NS and the mares with persistent lytic infection of PBL with EHV5 did not transfer the infection to their foals.  
 
 To determine if any of the animals examined were latently infected with the alphaherpesviruses, an examination for transcripts of genes 63 and 64 of EHV1 and EHV4, putative latency-associated transcripts (LAT) of EHV, was undertaken. Evidence of these transcripts was detected in PBL and bronchiolar lymph nodes in the absence of transcripts of the structural gB, supporting previous studies indicating that transcripts of genes 63 and 64 may represent LAT.  In PBL, EHV1 gene 64 RNA transcripts but not gene 63 transcripts were detected in PBL. In bronchiolar lymph nodes, EHV1 gene 64 (but not gene 63) RNA transcripts were detected. In contrast, EHV4 infection was detected in the trigeminal ganglia only and there was no evidence of EHV4 infection in lymph nodes or PBL. In the trigeminal ganglion, EHV4 gB DNA and gene 63 RNA transcripts were detected. The presence of RNA transcripts of EHV1 gene 64 in PBL and lymph node in the absence of any evidence of the replication of structural proteins suggests PBL and lymph node are sites of EHV1 latent infections. The presence of EHV4 gene 63 transcripts in trigeminal ganglia in the absence of any evidence of replication of structural proteins suggests the trigeminal ganglion is the major site of latency of EHV4.
 
 As a potential means of detecting latency of the gammaherpesvirus EHV2, 4 EHV2 genes ORF74, E4, E8 and E10 were selected as having possible roles during EHV2 latency based on sequence analysis and comparison with gene products identified or postulated as having roles in latency in other gammaherpesviruses. Kinetic transcription of these genes was evaluated in an in vitro time course study using a non neuronal cell line (equine kidney [EK] cells). While the gB and gH genes encoding structural glycoproteins were abundantly transcribed in vitro, the 4 putative EHV2 latency-associated genes were minimally transcribed during lytic infection in EK cells, a result analogous to results obtained for the expression of LATs in other gammaherpesviruses. Attempts to demonstrate transcription products of these genes in PBL or other tissues of horsed presumed to be latently infected with EHV2 (in which gB transcripts had been detected previously) and actively infected with EHV2 (in which gB transcripts had been detected at the time of sampling), were unsuccessful.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/731/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A different kind of 'subject:' Aboriginal legal status and colonial law in Western Australia, 1829 -1861</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Anne Patricia</field><field name="description">A different kind of &#8216;subject:&#8217; Aboriginal legal status and colonial law in Western Australia, 1829-1861. This thesis is an examination of the nature and application of the policy regarding the legal status and rights of Aboriginal people in Western Australia from 1829 to 1861. It describes the extent of the debates and the role of British law that arose after conflict between Aboriginal people and settlers in the context of political and economic contests between settlers and government on land issues. While the British government continually maintained that the legal basis for annexation was settlement, by the mid 1830s Stirling regarded it as an &#8216;invasion,&#8217; but was neither prepared to accept that Aboriginal people had to consent to the imposition of British law upon them, nor to formally recognise their rights as the original owners of the land. Instead, Stirling&#8217;s government applied an archaic form of outlawry to Aboriginal people who resisted the invasion. This was despite proposals for agreements in the 1830s.
 
 During the early 1840s there was a temporary legal pluralism in Western Australia where Indigenous laws were officially recognised. However, by the mid 1840s the administration of British law in Western Australia was increasingly dictated by settler interests and mounting settler-magistrate pressure to modify the legal position of Aboriginal people which resulted in the development of colonial law to construct a landless subject status with minimal rights based on their value as a useful labour force for the pastoral economy. This separate legal status deliberately departed from &#8216;equality&#8217; principles and corresponded with the diminished status of Indigenous laws and the abandonment of legal pluralism in settled districts, during a period of rapid pastoral expansion in the 1850s. This entrenched discriminatory practice in colonial law would be the prelude to the &#8216;protectionist&#8217; and discriminatory legislation of the early twentieth century which formalised inequality of legal status.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/732/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation and bioactivity of 1,8-cineole derivatives</field><field name="creator">Knight, Allan Ray</field><field name="description">The naturally occurring monoterpene 1,3,3-trimethyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane 1, commonly named 1,8-cineole and the major component in the leaf oil of many eucalypts, exhibits bioactivity, being potentially antimicrobial and pesticidal.  A range of derivatives of 1,8-cineole and its naturally occurring isomeric analogue 1,4-cineole 2, 1-isopropyl-4-methyl-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, were synthesised.  High-cineole eucalyptus oil, 1,8-cineole and the 1,8- and 1,4-cineole derivatives were shown to have a dose dependent pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicidal activity against radish (Raphanus sativus var. Long Scarlet), and annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) in laboratory bioassays.  A postulated increase in activity of the ester derivatives due to metabolic cleavage into their bioactive hydroxy-cineole and carboxylic acid portions after uptake by the plant was not observed.
 
 The role of mallee eucalypts in the rehabilitation of degraded farmland in the Western Australian wheat belt, uses of eucalyptus oil and the bioactivity of essential oils and naturally occurring terpenes, with particular emphasis on eucalyptus oil and 1,8-cineole, were reviewed.  The review encompasses allelopathic and herbicidal activity, insecticidal, acaricidal and antimicrobial activity.
 
 1,8-Cineole compounds functionalised at position 3 of the cyclohexane ring and the 1,4-cineole derivatives were chemically synthesised whilst 2-endo-hydroxy-1,8-cineole was obtained as the primary metabolite of a novel bacterium grown on 1,8-cineole as sole carbon source.  The bacteria were isolated by inoculating liquid growth medium containing 1,8-cineole as carbon source with aliquots of deionised water in which eucalyptus leaves had been stirred.  Sequencing of its 16S rRNA gene identified the bacteria as belonging to the order Sphingomonadales, family Sphingomonadaceae and genus Sphingomonas.  Growth curves for the bacterium are described and a metabolic pathway for the microbial degradation of 1,8-cineole is confirmed.  Bacteria were cultured on a 20 L scale to provide sufficient 2-endo-hydroxy-1,8-cineole for the herbicidal bioassays.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/733/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maritime piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh, 1992-2006: a prismatic interpretation of security</field><field name="creator">Liss, Carolin</field><field name="description">Southeast Asia and Bangladesh are at present global hot-spots of pirate attacks on merchant vessels and fishing boats. This thesis explains why, and in what form, piracy still exists. It will argue that an examination of contemporary piracy is important because it can be understood as both a symptom and a reflection of a range of geo-political and socio-economic problems and security concerns.
 
 The thesis examines pirate attacks on small craft, including fishing boats, and merchant vessels in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh between 1992 and 2006. It describes the different types of contemporary pirate attacks, identifies piracy hot-spots, and looks at the various kinds of pirates active in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh. Furthermore, it discusses a number of factors which have contributed to the shaping of modern day piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh. Issues examined in this regard include the impact of ecological degradation and over-fishing on the occurrence of piracy; loop-holes and shortcomings in maritime laws and regulations that are conducive to the operations of pirates; the involvement of transnational crime syndicates and radical politically motivated groups in piracy; and the problems with state and private responses to pirate attacks.
 
 It will be argued that the examination of these factors reveals not only how they shape piracy, but that they also have an impact upon security well beyond pirate attacks. Examining piracy in this way is akin to looking through a prism, allowing a critical gaze to be cast over a range of political, social, and ecological developments, as well as security risks, and their impact on the lives and circumstances of people in Southeast Asia, Bangladesh, and the wider international community. It will be suggested that piracy and the various responses to it both reflect political and social developments within countries, and co-operation, tension and friction between states. Additionally, it will be demonstrated that the occurrence of pirate attacks in a region or a country indicates the existence of a wide range of traditional and non-traditional security risks, which can have far reaching repercussions for individuals, nations, or the international community. Through the examination of piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh, and the responses it triggers, important new trends and practices in the security sector are also identified, including the increasing privatisation of security and protection services around the globe.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/734/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of a functional genomics approach to the identification of vaccine subunits and diagnostic antigens for use in the control of swine dysentery</field><field name="creator">Song, Yong</field><field name="description">The intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is the causative agent of swine dysentery (SD), a diarrhoeal disease of pigs which has significant economic impact worldwide. Controlling SD remains problematic, particularly as there is no effective vaccine and there are few definitive diagnostic methods available. In this study, a partial genomic sequence of B. hyodysenteriae was screened in silico. A total of 19 putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding outer-membrane proteins then were selected and these were subjected to a laboratory screening process. To select potential universal vaccines, a preliminary study was conducted using PCR to determine the distribution of the putative genes in 23 strains of B. hyodysenteriae. A total of 17 of the 19 ORFs were considered to be suitable for further testing as they were found to be present in the majority of strains investigated. After molecular cloning and protein expression and purification, of 19 cloned candidate molecules derived from 17 genes (one large gene was divided into two parts encoding N and C terminal proteins, respectively), 14 were expressed in E. coli and the recombinant proteins were successfully produced. A variety of sera from pigs naturally and experimentally infected with B. hyodysenteriae were tested for reactivity with the 14 recombinant proteins in an immunoblotting assay. Seven molecules from six genes reacted strongly with the tested sera, and therefore were selected and used to immunize mice. All these proteins generated a specific antibody response. Post-immunization sera raised against each recombinant protein had the capacity to agglutinate B. hyodysenteriae cells, and also recognized the cognate proteins of B. hyodysenteriae in cell extracts. Further sequencing analysis demonstrated that these molecules were highly conserved in the genomes of different B.hyodysenteriae strains. Therefore, from the genomic based study, the products of six genes were identified as promising candidates for vaccines or as diagnostic targets.
 
 Four genes were expressed on a large scale, the product (NAV-H7, NAV-H17 Cterminal, NAV-H34 and NAV-H42) were combined into one vaccine, and then this preparation was used to immunise pigs that subsequently were challenged with B. hyodysenteriae. These antigens generate systemic and colonic antibody responses, and vaccination tended both to delay the onset of clinical signs and attenuate lesion development. Hence these recombinant proteins showed promise as components for further SD vaccines. Recombinant proteins from the selected genes also were used as antigens in class-specific ELISAs used as serological assays for SD. Three antigens (NAV-H8, NAV-H42 and Bhlp29.7) were selected as good indicators of seroconversion in IgM ELISAs, and these were evaluated further using a large range of serum samples. The NAV-H8 IgM ELISA using a cut-off value 2.5 times the mean value of all negative pigs could be used as a herd test for SD, and both the NAV-H8 and NAV-H42 IgM ELISAs had potential for detecting exposure to B. hyodysenteriae at the pig level.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/737/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The digitisation of politics: from the emergence of modulation to the dissolution of the body politic</field><field name="creator">Savat, David</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of politics in the context of digital technologies. Its central claim is that technologies of what I call the digital ensemble express a politics that is very different from that of other technological ensembles. In order to come to an understanding of politics in the digital, this thesis explores three broader themes by way of discussions of three different technologies or assemblages of the digital. While I do not aim to establish an overarching conclusion as to a politics of the digital, I do identify both elements that are common among the three themes and where they diverge from one another.
 
 The first theme concerns the operation of power in the context of the database and examines how subjects are acted upon. I argue that databases represent both an amplification of the disciplinary mode of power and, as a product of that amplification, also express a new mode of power referred to by Deleuze as modulation. It is this concurrent operation of these two modes of power that produces the subject as 'dividual', both object and objectile at the same time, which has a number of consequences in terms of how subjects are controlled and governed.
 
 The second theme considers how the subject is constituted as actor and how this relates to the construction of the political in the context of the digital ensemble. This is achieved by way of looking at the concept of the interface. I argue that digital technologies constitute very different practices or forms of doing, both spatially and temporally. Using a broader phenomenological approach, I argue that these technologies constitute very different forms of being than that of the individual that is so central to much of modern political thought and its construction of the political. A key expression of the political in the digital ensemble, I argue, is the interface, enabling the production of a new human-machine assemblage constituting itself as flow/s.
 
 The third theme is an exploration of the conceptualisation of political action in the context of digital technologies. Here I make use of the technological assemblage of the network in exploring the actions of fluid beings. I argue that modern political thought has always conceptualised political action as the action of solid entities acting upon and in relation to other solid entities. In the context of digital technologies, however, I argue that such a conceptualisation of action is not very useful; if one conceptualises the actor as fluid, then so must its actions be conceptualised as fluid. It is in such a context that concepts of flow and turbulence gain great importance in coming to terms with politics in the digital. Indeed, to the extent that a digitisation of politics can be discerned, I argue it makes much sense to think of it as a politics of fluidity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/738/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathogenesis and detection of porcine circovirus type 2 in the Australian pig herd</field><field name="creator">O'Dea, Mark</field><field name="description">The diagnosis of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) in pigs requires the detection of characteristic clinical signs and pathological changes, and the detection of virus in tissues of affected pigs.  To increase Australia&#8217;s capacity to independently diagnose PCVAD in Australia, techniques for the detection of Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection in pigs were developed and are reported in this thesis.  These techniques were applied to samples obtained from normal pigs and pigs with disease and confirmed the presence of PCV2 and PCVAD in the Australian pig herd.
 
 Viral DNA was detected in tissues of infected pigs by both standard PCR and real-time PCR techniques.  The real-time PCR was more sensitive.  While the conventional PCR was able to detect approximately 100 copies of the viral genome, the real-time PCR was able to detect 20 copies of the genome.  An immunohistochemical (IHC) technique which was also developed enabled the visualisation of PCV2 antigen in fixed tissues of pigs with PCVAD.
 
 The techniques that were developed were applied to an examination of tissues from pigs affected by illthrift and increased weaner mortality in herds in South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia.  Lesions suggestive of the PCVAD postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) were detected and virus antigen was detected in association with lesions.  The nature of the clinical signs and histopathological lesions detected, coupled with the presence of PCV2 antigen, suggested that PCVAD was present in some Australian pig herds.  Phylogenetic analysis of the strains of PCV2-associated with these disease outbreaks demonstrated they were of a type not previously detected in Australia and similar to strains associated with PMWS in North America.
 
 To further assist in investigation of PCV2 infections in the Australian pig herd, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed that specifically detected antibody to PCV2 and not the related and non-pathogenic Porcine circovirus type 1. The development of this assay required the production of a virus capsid protein antigen using a prokaryotic protein production system.  The ELISA was used to test serum samples form the Australian national pig serum bank.  A high prevalence of PCV2 infection was detected in most pig herds examined in all Australian states.
 
 International trade in pig meat has resulted in many countries placing restrictions on the importation of pig meat, requiring imported pig meats to be cooked to destroy viral agents.  This study investigated the in vitro resistance of an Australian strain of PCV2 to heat treatment at temperatures between 56&#176;C and 85&#176;C.  The viability of the virus was determined by a combination of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and IHC to visualise viral capsid antigen within infected cells.  This study indicated that PCV2 retained its infectivity following heating up to and including 75&#176;C for 15 mins, but was inactivated following heating to 80&#176;C and above.  
 
 The investigations reported make a significant contribution to PCV2 research in Australia and ensure Australia&#8217;s capacity to independently investigate PCVAD in the Australian pig herd.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/739/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of operational tasks in chemical plants</field><field name="creator">Nikraz, Magid</field><field name="description">The overall, coordinated management of different operational tasks in a chemical plant can improve operational efficiency. These operational tasks can be hierarchically categorised, from the lowest to highest level, as: data acquisition; regulatory control; monitoring; data reconciliation; fault detection and diagnosis; supervisory control; scheduling; and planning. Although each of these tasks is responsible for a particular function, they are dependent on each other, which is why an approach wherein all the different tasks can be integrated into a single unified framework is desirable. While integration has important benefits such as a significant reduction in operator workload and improved decision making, its realisation presents considerable challenges. Few previous works have addressed this topic and even fewer have investigated recent computing paradigms which may greatly assist in the development of a unifying framework.
 
 Multi-agent systems were introduced and investigated in this study as a possible means for achieving integration of operational tasks in chemical plants. Multi-agent systems are the subject of a sub-field of computing research known as agent-based computing. Agent-based computing represents a relatively recent and powerful high-level computing paradigm.
 
 Initially, a number of software applications were developed for the purposes of this study to assist realisation of the operational tasks. To simplify the process of system development and provide guidance for those unfamiliar with multi-agent systems wishing to adopt the proposed technique, an extensive methodology was devised. The operational tasks were then integrated using the proposed methodology to form an integrated multi-agent system, with the pilot plant at Murdoch University being used as a test base for the solution. The results were positive and demonstrated that the proposed agent-based solution was able to effectively account for the pilot plant setting. It was concluded that, in addition to presently available integration techniques and base technologies, the agent-based approach to integration of operational tasks in chemical plants presents a viable alternative solution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/741/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In a city like Delhi: sustainability and spirituality</field><field name="creator">Narayanan, Yamini</field><field name="description">The broad purpose of &#8216;In A City Like Delhi&#8217; is to make an argument in favour of the positive link between spirituality and sustainability. Sustainability, at its core, requires an ethical commitment, and the thesis proposes that spirituality may be that vital means through which sustainability may be truly animated, in theory and in practice.  The thesis is particularly preoccupied with considering the yet fully unrealised competence of spirituality to enrich the understanding and practise of sustainability in the urban space. To this end, it uses a very particular case study to make a modest exploration of such a conceptual association &#8211; the city of Delhi.
 
 The concept of sustainability, as articulated in the West, is primarily a secular notion. While international religious and spiritual organisations have taken up the sustainability challenge, the reverse is less true &#8211; sustainability planning is rarely conducted in a dialogue with religious or spiritual institutions and resources. In this context the case study of an Indian megacity to examine the relationship between religion, spirituality, secularism and development, is particularly interesting. The thesis explores, as one example of the potential interface, how Hindu spirituality as interpreted by Mahatma Gandhi, may usefully inform a spiritual philosophy to enliven a sustainability consciousness in Delhi.
 
 The theoretical speculations of the thesis are grounded in the local context by seeking the perspectives of twenty primary informants from Delhi who are all associated with various levels of planning and implementing development in the city. I specifically chose my interviewees from secular development backgrounds (rather than religious and spiritual representatives) because this would enrich critical understanding of how spirituality may be viewed within a secular sustainability discourse. I use their views on spirituality, sustainable development, and any affinities between the two notions to balance my own perspective, derived from both my research and my personal experience of the city of my birth. The interviews gave added depth to the environmental, economic and social challenges confronting the city of Delhi, which were already evident in the literature review. Additionally however, the interviews confirmed the hypothesis that sustainable development and spirituality together could have a productive, coherent and an even inseparable grounding union in Delhi and that spirituality may be vital in facilitating that essential shift in consciousness that a sustainable mindset requires. These findings are crucial to any study or strategy considering comprehensive sustainable development for Delhi.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/743/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A reverse vaccinology approach to identifying subunit proteins for use in vaccines against Brachyspira pilosicoli infections in humans and animals</field><field name="creator">Movahedi, Abdolreza</field><field name="description">The anaerobic intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira pilosicoli is the causative agent of &#8220;intestinal spirochaetosis&#8221; (IS), a disease of humans and a number of animal species. IS has been reported in adults and children worldwide but the prevalence in people living in poor hygienic conditions, indigenous populations, homosexual males, and in immunocompromised people is much higher than in other populations. IS is also widespread in pigs and chickens, and causes significant economic impact in the associated industries. To date attempts to develop a vaccine against B. pilosicoli to protect humans and animals have not been successful.
 
 In this study a reverse vaccinology approach was used, in which 24 putative open reading frames (ORFs) derived from a partial genome sequence of B. pilosicoli were subjected to in silico and laboratory screening processes to identify potential efficacious vaccine antigens. In silico analysis of the ORFs using a range of bioinformatics algorithms assigned 12 ORF products as periplasmic, outer membrane, or secretory proteins, and these were given a high priority as potential vaccine candidates. The 12 selected ORFs were amplified from a human strain of B. pilosicoli (Wes-B) and cloned. Products from nine ORFS were successfully over-expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system, and then purified using affinity chromatography.
 
 In an in vitro immunogenicity trial all the recombinant proteins except for NAV-P27 were strongly recognised in Western immunoblots by a mouse serum raised against B. pilosicoli strain WesB, and by a subset of convalescent sera from pigs naturally and experimentally infected with B. pilosicoli. In an analysis of in vivo immunogenicity, the post-immunisation mouse sera raised against each recombinant protein reacted strongly with each specific proteins, and also recognised the native
 
 protein in extracts of B. pilosicoli strain WesB. Sequence analysis of four randomly selected ORFs showed that these were highly conserved amongst the genomes of different human and swine strains of B. pilosicoli. Evaluation of all the data obtained in the reverse vaccinology approach resulted in selection of four ORF products (NAV-P3, NAV-13, NAV-22 and NAV-31) as being potentially protective antigens to be analysed for their further efficacy. These four recombinant proteins were assessed for their efficacy as vaccine components in a mouse model of IS, where the animals were challenged with a human strain of B. pilosicoli. The proteins all induced systemic and local antibody responses, and tended to reduce spirochaete colonisation following experimental infection. These proteins used individually or in combination now have the potential to be further developed into a new vaccine to prevent B. pilosicoli infections.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/744/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destructive discourse: 'Japan-bashing' in the United States, Australia and Japan in the 1980s and 1990s</field><field name="creator">Morris, Narrelle</field><field name="description">By the 1960s-70s, most Western commentators agreed that Japan had rehabilitated itself from World War II, in the process becoming on the whole a reliable member of the international community.

By the late 1980s, a new &#8216;Japan Problem&#8217; had been identified in Western countries, although the presentation of Japan as a dangerous &#8216;other&#8217; was nevertheless familiar from past historical eras.  The term &#8216;Japan-bashing&#8217; was used by opponents of this negative view to suggest that much of the critical rhetoric about a &#8216;Japan Problem&#8217; could be reduced to an unwarranted, probably racist, assault on Japan.
   
 This thesis argues that the invention and popularisation of the highly-contested label &#8216;Japan-bashing&#8217;, rather than averting criticism of Japan, perversely helped to exacerbate and transform the moderate anti-Japanese sentiment that had existed in Western countries in the late 1970s and early 1980s into a widely disseminated, heavily politicised and even encultured phenomenon in the late 1980s and 1990s.  Moreover, when the term &#8216;Japan-bashing&#8217; spread to Japan itself, Japanese commentators were quick to respond.  In fact, the level and the nature of the response from the Japanese side is one crucial factor that distinguishes &#8216;Japan-bashing&#8217; in the 1980s and 1990s from anti-Japanese sentiment expressed in the West in earlier periods.
   
 Ultimately, the label and the practice of &#8216;Japan-bashing&#8217; helped to transform intellectual and popular discourses about Japan in both Western countries and Japan itself in the 1980s and 1990s.  Moreover, in doing so, it revealed crucial features of wider Western and Japanese perceptions of the global order in the late twentieth century.  Debates about Japan showed, for example, that economic strength had become at least as important as military power to national discourses about identity.  However, the view that Western countries and Japan are generally incompatible, and share few, if any, common values, interests or goals, has been largely discarded in the early twenty-first century, in a process that demonstrated just how constructed, and transitory, such views can be.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/745/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crossing boundaries: Suzuki Bokushi (1770-1842) and the rural elite of Tokugawa Japan</field><field name="creator">Moriyama, Takeshi</field><field name="description">This thesis centres on a member of the rural elite, Suzuki Bokushi (1770-1842) of Echigo, and his social environment in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868).  Through a case study of the interaction between one individual&#8217;s life and his social conditions, the thesis participates in the ongoing scholarly reassessment of Tokugawa society, which had an apparently rigid political and social structure, yet many features that suggest a prototype of modernity.  Bokushi&#8217;s life was multifaceted.  He was a village administrator, landlord, pawnbroker, poet, painter, and great communicator, with a nation-wide correspondence network that crossed various social classes.  His remote location and humble lifestyle notwithstanding, he was eventually able to publish a book about his region, Japan&#8217;s &#8216;snow country&#8217;.  This thesis argues that Bokushi&#8217;s life epitomises both the potentiality and the restrictions of his historical moment for a well-placed member of the rural elite.  An examination of Bokushi&#8217;s life and texts certainly challenges residual notions of the rigidity of social boundaries between the urban and the rural, between social statuses, and between cultural and intellectual communities.  But Bokushi&#8217;s own actions and attitudes also show the force of conservative social values in provincial life.  His activities were also still restrained by the external environment in terms of geographical remoteness, infrastructural limitation, political restrictions, cultural norms and the exigencies of human relationships.  Bokushi&#8217;s life shows that in his day, Tokugawa social frameworks were being shaken and reshaped by people&#8217;s new attempts to cross conventional boundaries, within, however, a range of freedom that had both external and internal limits.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/746/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selecting medical students: an Australian case study</field><field name="creator">Mercer, Annette</field><field name="description">The recognition that medical practitioners require more than simply a high level of academic ability to function successfully in their profession, together with a sharp increase in the number of academically qualified applicants to medical courses, has led to new ways of selecting medical students. Consequently the selection of students into the high-stakes course of medicine has become an area of considerable interest and research activity. The issues involved in selection are now prominent in the medical and medical education literature published in the UK, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and in some European countries. At the same time as the introduction of new selection procedures, and independently of it, due to advances in pedagogy the nature of the medical curriculum has also changed. Changes have been characterised by the use of problem-based learning, and an emphasis on self-directed learning, as well as an increase in interaction between the students in classes and between students and their teachers. The recognition that problemsolving, communication and interaction skills in the courses, in addition to the requisite intellectual capacity, would enhance performance as practitioners, has reinforced the need for students to be selected on a different set of attributes from those used previously.
 
 In Australia, changes in the way in which medical students are selected were initiated by the University of Newcastle in the early 1990s, with the introduction of some tests of cognitive skills and an interview. Over the following ten years, the other Australian undergraduate medical schools followed suit and a three-component selection process developed in an attempt to differentiate among the high calibre applicants to medical courses, by identifying additional important skills and attributes. The three components are the academic score, results on an aptitude test and results on a selection interview. Two of the nine undergraduate medical schools chose not to use a selection interview.
 
 The focus of this thesis is on evaluating the new selection processes and investigating the consequences of the admission of school-leaver applicants into undergraduate medical courses, where the Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) is the academic criterion for determining suitability to undertake tertiary studies. Each undergraduate medical school has developed its own unique way to operationalise the selection of its students. However, the use of the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admissions Test (UMAT), which developed out of the University of Newcastle&#8217;s test of cognitive skills, and the conduct of an interview for a select group of applicants are common to these practices. The implementation of the new selection processes has not been without its critics, mainly from within the medical profession. This thesis studies the issues which underlie the three components of selection (the TER, the UMAT and a selection interview) and uses as a case study the particular process used to select students into the six year undergraduate medical course at The University of Western Australia (UWA).
 
 The UWA selection process involves applicants passing a threshold score on each of the three components and then being ranked by a mechanism which combines the three scores with equal weight. This is a compensatory system in which applicants can compensate for a score near the threshold on one component by high scores on the other two components. This study showed that the resultant cohort is eclectic in its characteristics, with the full range of scores (above the threshold) in each component being represented.
 
 Both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection were used to address the issues surrounding the way in which medical students are selected and the outcomes of such processes. First, semi-structured interviews were held with different groups of stakeholders, including the staff at secondary schools which prepare the students for tertiary entrance; academic and administrative staff at The University of Western Australia (UWA); academic and administrative staff at other Australian universities; and senior staff at the major teaching hospitals in Western Australia. Secondly, quantitative studies on UWA data addressed the predictive validity of the components of selection; inter-rater reliability and the internal consistency of the data sets from the selection interview; and the attrition rate in the course.
 
 Outcomes from the research showed that in general, the reactions from stakeholders have been positive. Importantly, academic levels amongst medical students and recent graduates do not appear to have been eroded by the new process, in which the academic threshold has been lowered. The UMAT is a contentious national test which has had its validity as a selection instrument questioned. A recent construct and content validity study on the UMAT (Mercer and Chiavaroli, 2006) has gone some way towards settling some of these issues, but the question of predictive validity has yet to be addressed adequately. The existence of commercially available preparation courses has been controversial because of the equity issues involved for those applicants who for some reason do not have access to such courses.
 
 The selection interview, one of the three components of selection, conducted by the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences at UWA, whilst attracting criticism from some for appearing stilted and overly prescriptive, was judged to be robust and rigorous by many of those directly involved in its implementation. Furthermore a high proportion of medical students were judged by their teachers to have good communication skills, which is a positive outcome for future members of the profession. A study to quantify reliability indices for the UWA selection interviews indicated high levels of inter-rater reliability and internal consistency of the ratings data produced.
 
 The predictive validity study conducted as part of this study showed the two major predictors of course outcomes at UWA to be the TER and female gender. The TER predicts outcomes in the knowledge-based units across the course and in some clinically-based units in the later years. However, the interview score (in particular the Communication Skills component) and scores on the first section of UMAT (Logical reasoning and problem solving) also predict outcomes in some of the clinically-based units.
 
 The results of these studies are encouraging to those who believe that the new selection process, whilst imperfect, has gone some way towards solving the problems attached to selection based solely on academic merit. The question now becomes how to improve further on the selection of medical students and to do so in an evidence-based way. The characteristics to be included in selection remain controversial. The rigorous assessment of such characteristics needs to be addressed in the longer term and will be an evolving issue, as the medical curriculum and the nature of the profession also continue to change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/748/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 1961 Kampong Bukit Ho Swee fire and the making of modern Singapore</field><field name="creator">Loh, Kah Seng</field><field name="description">By 1970, Singapore&#8217;s urban landscape was dominated by high-rise blocks of planned public housing built by the People&#8217;s Action Party government, signifying the establishment of a high modernist nation-state. A decade earlier, the margins of the City had been dominated by kampongs, home to semi-autonomous communities of low-income Chinese families which freely built, and rebuilt, unauthorised wooden houses. This change was not merely one of housing but belied a more fundamental realignment of state-society relations in the 1960s. Relocated in Housing and Development Board flats, urban kampong families were progressively integrated into the social fabric of the emergent nation-state. This study examines the pivotal role of an event, the great Kampong Bukit Ho Swee fire of 1961, in bringing about this transformation. The redevelopment of the fire site in the aftermath of the calamity brought to completion the British colonial regime&#8217;s &#8216;emergency&#8217; programmes of resettling urban kampong dwellers in planned accommodation, in particular, of building emergency public housing on the sites of major fires in the 1950s. The PAP&#8217;s far greater political resolve, and the timing of and state of emergency occasioned by the scale of the 1961 disaster, enabled the government to rehouse the Bukit Ho Swee fire victims in emergency housing in record time. This in turn provided the HDB with a strategic platform for clearing other kampongs and for transforming their residents into model citizens of the nation-state. The 1961 fire&#8217;s symbolic usefulness extended into the 1980s and beyond, in sanctioning the PAP&#8217;s new housing redevelopment schemes. The official account of the inferno has also become politically useful for the government of today for disciplining a new generation of Singaporeans against taking the nation&#8217;s progress for granted. Against these exalted claims of the fire&#8217;s role in the Singapore Story, this study also examines the degree of actual change and continuity in the social and economic lives of the people of Bukit Ho Swee after the inferno. In some crucial ways, the residents continued to occupy a marginal place in society while pondering, too, over the unresolved question of the cause of the fire. These continuities of everyday life reflect the ambivalence with which the citizenry regarded the high modernist state in contemporary Singapore.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/750/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transoceanic radical: the many identities of William Duane</field><field name="creator">Little, Nigel Ken</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the American career of William Duane (1760-1835) in the light of his earlier, and much less studied period in Ireland, England and India. It is the study of the development of one of America&#8217;s pre-eminent newspaper editors. Although Duane is not a first-tier figure of the Early Republican period such as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson or Alexander Hamilton, he certainly fits comfortably within the second-tier with men such as James Thomson Callender, Tench Coxe, John Binns and William Cobbett. He is an important figure within the historiography on the Early Republican period which has come out in recent years. He has an important role in three recent and seminal works on the period by Durey, Wilson and Pasley: Transatlantic Radicals, United Irishmen, United States and &#8220;The Tyranny of Printers&#8221;.
 
 This is a study of the identity of Duane measured against his political change and shifting sense of self. It seeks to answer the question: Who was William Duane? The thesis probes the question in depth by looking at Duane&#8217;s origins and then tracing his life in 1790s Philadelphia. The portrayal of Duane found in the recent historiography and in the first academic biography of Duane, Kim T. Phillips&#8217; William Duane: A Radical Journalist in the Age of Jefferson, lets Duane&#8217;s version of self rest too easily, without interrogating how he constructed his identity within an American political context for an American reading audience. For example, although Duane constructed himself as a citizen of the United States by birth, the thesis maintains that he was not an U.S. citizen at all but was born in Newfoundland and was by eighteenth-century definitions a British subject.
 
 The thesis offers a great deal more detailed archival research within the above framework. First, it develops Duane&#8217;s familial relationships in his early life in much more detail than before. I have uncovered more details on his life from numerous sources, particularly letters, and a careful, textual search for any information on Duane&#8217;s earlier career in Ireland and England in the 1780s which has been overlooked by previous researchers. The thesis then places this material in the context of the newspaper trade in 1780s Clonmel and London while building a narrative analysis of this period before moving on to India.
 
 Second, this thesis demonstrates Duane&#8217;s links to the East India Company army. The importance of Duane&#8217;s Indian career also lies in his being part of a wider chronology of deported editors and government suppression of the press within the period from 1780 to 1799. The place of Duane within an ignored history of radical migrations to India is also dealt with as is his emergence as a pro revolutionary editor in Calcutta after the declaration of war in 1793.
 
 Third, the thesis uncovers a great deal more archival information on the period of Duane&#8217;s membership of the London Corresponding Society and his editorship of the Telegraph &#8211; a strongly pro-French newspaper in wartime London. This period was a short but crucial one for Duane as he witnessed first-hand the last real throes of a British revolutionary movement and the enactment of two important bills which sought to smother the L.C.S. and the other plebeian radical groups.
 
 Fourth, the thesis examines Duane&#8217;s role in what has been perceived as a crucial turning point in American history &#8211; the election of Thomas Jefferson to the presidency in 1800. The thesis seeks to understand what Duane&#8217;s impact on American politics was and how his earlier career shaped his political outlook and his actions in America. It seeks to denativise the Early Republican Period by pointing out outside currents that Duane used in defining what Americanness was as opposed to his conceptualisation of Federalism and Britain.
 
 Finally, the thesis argues that the story of William Duane is one of an eighteenthcentury editor&#8217;s transoceanic search for a home.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/751/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework and evaluation of conversation agents</field><field name="creator">Goh, Ong Sing</field><field name="description">This project details the development of a novel and practical framework for the development of conversation agents (CAs), or conversation robots. CAs, are software programs which can be used to provide a natural interface between human and computers. In this study, &#8216;conversation&#8217; refers to real-time dialogue exchange between human and machine which may range from web chatting to &#8220;on-the-go&#8221; conversation through mobile devices. In essence, the project proposes a &#8220;smart and effective&#8221; communication technology where an autonomous agent is able to carry out simulated human conversation via multiple channels. The CA developed in this project is termed &#8220;Artificial Intelligence Natural-language Identity&#8221; (AINI) and AINI is used to illustrate the implementation and testing carried out in this project. Up to now, most CAs have been developed with a short term objective to serve as tools to convince users that they are talking with real humans as in the case of the Turing Test. The traditional designs have mainly relied on ad-hoc approach and hand-crafted domain knowledge. Such approaches make it difficult for a fully integrated system to be developed and modified for other domain applications and tasks. The proposed framework in this thesis addresses such limitations. Overcoming the weaknesses of previous systems have been the key challenges in this study. The research in this study has provided a better understanding of the system requirements and the development of a systematic approach for the construction of intelligent CAs based on agent architecture using a modular N-tiered approach. This study demonstrates an effective implementation and exploration of the new paradigm of Computer Mediated Conversation (CMC) through CAs. The most significant aspect of the proposed framework is its ability to re-use and encapsulate expertise such as domain knowledge, natural language query and human-computer interface through plug-in components. As a result, the developer does not need to change the framework implementation for different applications. This proposed system provides interoperability among heterogeneous systems and it has the flexibility to be adapted for other languages, interface designs and domain applications. A modular design of knowledge representation facilitates the creation of the CA knowledge bases. This enables easier integration of open-domain and domain-specific knowledge with the ability to provide answers for broader queries. In order to build the knowledge base for the CAs, this study has also proposed a mechanism to gather information from commonsense collaborative knowledge and online web documents. The proposed Automated Knowledge Extraction Agent (AKEA) has been used for the extraction of unstructured knowledge from the Web. On the other hand, it is also realised that it is important to establish the trustworthiness of the sources of information. This thesis introduces a Web Knowledge Trust Model (WKTM) to establish the trustworthiness of the sources.
 
 In order to assess the proposed framework, relevant tools and application modules have been developed and an evaluation of their effectiveness has been carried out to validate the performance and accuracy of the system. Both laboratory and public experiments with online users in real-time have been carried out. The results have shown that the proposed system is effective. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the CA could be implemented on the Web, mobile services and Instant Messaging (IM). In the real-time human-machine conversation experiment, it was shown that AINI is able to carry out conversations with human users by providing spontaneous interaction in an unconstrained setting. The study observed that AINI and humans share common properties in linguistic features and paralinguistic cues. These human-computer interactions have been analysed and contributed to the understanding of how the users interact with CAs. Such knowledge is also useful for the development of conversation systems utilising the commonalities found in these interactions. While AINI is found having difficulties in responding to some forms of paralinguistic cues, this could lead to research directions for further work to improve the CA performance in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/752/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The challenge of stickiness in knowledge transfer among information and communication technology (ict) firms in Malaysian technology parks</field><field name="creator">Mhd Sarif, Suhaimi</field><field name="description">e study examines knowledge transfer between firms by using the concept of stickiness to conceptualise problems with knowledge transfer. The concept of stickiness is sub-divided into &#8220;macro&#8221; and &#8220;micro&#8221; levels stickiness. As for &#8220;macro&#8221; level stickiness, the study uses literature in the field of innovation studies, in which governments have been identified as major contributors to macro level stickiness. The study uses literature in the economics of knowledge and evolutionary economics to develop the concept of &#8220;micro&#8221; level stickiness, which refers to firms&#8217; contributions to stickiness. Four factors are used to examine micro stickiness: transfer mechanisms, types of transfer, knowledge barriers, and transfer contexts. After explaining the concept of stickiness and providing a background to technology parks policy, the study examines the perceptions of a variety of informants of stickiness in knowledge transfer among ICT firms in Malaysian technology parks. The study approached seven (out of eleven) Malaysian technology parks, over a period of three months in 2005 (May-July 2005) and a month in 2007 (August 2007). It interviewed fifty (50) informants, who included policy makers, government officers, and executives of ICT firms in Malaysian technology parks. With respect to &#8220;macro&#8221; level stickiness, policy makers and government confirmed that the government cannot exclude previous policy documents that contained three major elements: national unity, foreign direct investment and sound economic growth to formulate policy for Malaysian technology parks, which does not solely encourage knowledge transfer because the policy documents permitted short term profit taking by ICT firms. With respect to &#8220;micro&#8221; level stickiness, the results suggest that transfer mechanisms, types of transfer, knowledge barriers, and transfer contexts are costly; thus, impede ICT firms from participating actively in knowledge transfer between ICT firms. This study suggests that the government and ICT firms should work closely to facilitate knowledge transfer between ICT firms in Malaysian technology parks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1298/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action of autochthonous bacteria on the decay of enteric viruses in groundwater</field><field name="creator">Wall, Katrina Joy</field><field name="description">With global freshwater supplies under pressure, viable water reuse methods are being examined to assist in improving water supplies. Municipal effluent is an ideal source for water reclamation as it is consistent in quality and quantity. The health aspects of water reuse have been identified as an issue of concern, in particular the potential presence of enteric viruses. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a method that can aid water reclamation by recharging water such as treated effluent into a suitable aquifer. Research into the removal of pathogenic contaminants by natural processes within aquifers, namely the action of autochthonous bacteria, has led to the consideration that MAR could be used to assist in the removal of microbial pathogens. Pathogens have been demonstrated to be removed during residence in groundwater, but the presence of active autochthonous groundwater bacteria are required for significant removal rates to occur. 
 
 The aim of this research was to investigate the interaction between autochthonous groundwater bacteria (AGB) and the enteroviruses Poliovirus type 1, Coxsackievirus B3 and Adenovirus B41. It was established that these viruses decrease in number in the presence of AGB but the mechanisms causing this decrease are poorly understood. Experiments were designed to examine how the individual AGB caused decay of the viruses. 
 
 In this study AGB were isolated and tested for their ability in increase the decay of the viruses. It was determined that 27 % (17/63) of the isolated AGB influenced viral decay. The AGB isolates varied in their influence with only 3 out of 17 isolates being able to cause of the decay of both poliovirus and coxsackievirus. Similar variations in decay were observed for adenovirus. Decay times for all three viruses varied amongst the AGB and between the viruses. 
 
 Experiments were undertaken to characterise the mechanism causing the antiviral activity of four groundwater isolates (1G, 3A, 4B and 9G) under varying conditions and treatments to give insight into the compounds or mechanisms responsible for viral decay. This would indicate whether compounds produced by the AGB responsible for viral decay were closely associated to bacterial cells (perhaps membrane bound), independent of metabolic activity, heat labile or were enzymatic in nature. 
 
 The influence of enzyme inhibiters and heat treatment indicated that viral degradation is caused by compounds that are enzymatic in nature. As viral numbers were monitored by nucleic acid copy numbers rather than via infectivity assays, the viral protein coats must be the first step in degradation followed by the removal of the viral nucleic acid. This two step process would require both protease and nuclease enzymes to result in loss of viral numbers as measured by RT-PCR/PCR. 
 
 Further characterisation and identification of these four bacterial isolates was also carried out. Three out of the four isolates were sequenced and analysed using partial 16S rRNA gene sequences to determine their phylogenetic relationships compared to related organisms. Isolate 3A was placed in the order Burkholderiales. Isolate 4B was placed in the family Xanthomonadaceae. Isolate 9G was placed in the family Rhizobiaceae. Isolate 1G was only partially sequenced and preliminary identification placed it in the phylum Bacteriodetes. 
 
 Understanding of the processes carried out by AGB within an aquifer during MAR using reclaimed waters will aid in increasing the viability of this water reuse process. If important natural processes could be utilised to remediate any potential pathogens, the health concerns with reclaimed waters could be addressed and solved simply through prescribed retention times within the aquifer. Key species of AGB may even be utilised as markers to assess the suitability of an aquifer for MAR.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1299/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Rejang of Sumatra: Exploring culture through literary journalism</field><field name="creator">Birt, Jill</field><field name="description">This thesis is about border crossing.  Literary Journalism is a border-crossing writing genre claiming ground in fields as diverse as science, mathematics, memoir, travel and culture. The established academic discipline of anthropology is also crossing borders as styles of writing ethnography are changing and being challenged.  This work is situated at the meeting point of these two genres. It examines how literary journalism can be used to write about culture for a wider audience beyond the academic community. 
 
 The defining characteristics of literary journalism &#8211; documentable subject, exhaustive research, novelistic writing techniques, voice and attention to underlying meaning &#8211; signal strengths and possible limitations to its use in writing about culture when measured against the demands of academic ethnographic writing. The requirements for research and writing about culture are examined from the perspectives of literary journalism and ethnography in Part 1 of this thesis. 
 
 To explore literary journalism&#8217;s suitability to write about culture, research was conducted among the Rejang people of Sumatra.   Part Two of the thesis, titled Family Strength, is presented as an example of a literary journalist approach to recording culture.  It is the result of five fieldtrips to Sumatra to gather data about members of four generations of Pak Taher&#8217;s family group in the village of Kelobak in the early 21st century.  Each section of Family Strength tells the story of Pak Taher&#8217;s relatives, highlighting changes within the lifetime of family members, including gender roles, religious values, the influence of education, generational change and farming practices.  The work is not an exhaustive treatment of Rejang culture but records culture as several &#8220;slices of life&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1300/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protecting civilians or preserving interests? Explaining the UN security council's non-intervention in Darfur, Sudan, 2003-06.</field><field name="creator">Mickler, David</field><field name="description">The UN Security Council is the preeminent multilateral decision-making body and has the legal authority to initiate military interventions if it first determines a threat to international peace and security, including from civil wars or widespread state repression. While traditional norms of non-intervention and the politics of the Cold War curtailed the body&#8217;s ability to fulfil this role, evolving understandings and practices of sovereignty and security in the post-Cold War era have led to the apparent emergence of a new norm permitting &#8216;humanitarian intervention&#8217; and an in principle acceptance that the body has a &#8216;responsibility to protect&#8217; vulnerable civilians residing inside the borders of their own state, including through military means.
 
 In this context, the thesis argues that the situation in Darfur, western Sudan, has represented a quintessential case for the Council to fulfil its &#8216;responsibility to protect&#8217;. According to a number of authoritative investigations, since 2003 the Sudanese government and government-allied Arab militias have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity on a widespread and systematic basis against Darfur&#8217;s non-Arab population. As a result, over 200,000 people died either directly from violence or indirectly from conflict-induced disease and malnutrition, while a further two million fled from their homes and villages in fear. A number of nonmilitary measures were attempted by the Council but failed to create adequate security on the ground. 
 
 As such, there was a compelling legal-institutional, normative and moral case for the Council to coercively deploy a military intervention in Sudan to protect vulnerable civilians in Darfur. However, during the 2003-06 period of study, no such intervention was deployed. The thesis argues that intervention by the Council was precluded by the national interests of its permanent members, including a lucrative economic relationship between China and Sudan, and because of valuable Sudanese intelligence cooperation in Western counter-terrorism operations in the region. The thesis concludes that the Council&#8217;s members chose to preserve these national interests at the expense of protecting civilians in Darfur.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1301/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential of Triclabendazole in combination with Praziquantel for the treatment of Schistosoma mansoni infections</field><field name="creator">Bong, Sze How</field><field name="description">Previous work has suggested that triclabendazole, a member of the benzimidazole group of compounds, possessed efficacy against Schistosoma mansoni. In view of recent indications in praziquantel treatment failures and loss of sensitivity, it is imperative that new anti-schistosomals are developed as contingent treatment options, while resistance alleles, if any, remain at low frequencies. While recent studies have indicated that triclabendazole monotherapy exert weak anti-schistosomal effects, the combinatorial application of triclabendazole with praziquantel has not been explored. To assess this hypothesis, triclabendazole and its metabolites were initially assessed against the many life-stages of Schistosoma mansoni in vitro. Combinatorial drug and isobologram analyses against adult Schistosoma mansoni was also performed, and subsequently applied against other parasitic models (Giardia duodenalis and Haemonchus contortus) to assess the specificity of such effects. Subsequently, the drug combinations were assessed against Schistosoma mansoni in vivo. To further assess the suitability of combinatorial drug applications, an economic model was developed to project the cost-efficacy of praziquantel-triclabendazole drug combinations in a global focus. It was concluded that triclabendazole and its metabolites possessed good efficacy against immature schistosomula, albeit weak efficacy against adult Schistosoma mansoni. Upon combination with praziquantel, however, a strong synergistic effect against adult worms were observed in vitro.

In this work I take as my starting point the increasing ubiquity of appeals to biology as an explanation for &#8216;human&#8217; and &#8216;woman&#8217;s&#8217; nature on the one hand, and the reactive and reflexive distancing of biology within feminist body theory on the other, to begin to question the middle ground. I aim to constructively dissent from taking up either of these positions in order to confront the question: what if the reductionists prove to be, even partially, right? In acknowledging that possibility, I am interested in whether/where there is potential for feminist theory to be more relaxed about biologically sex differentiated attributes. 
 
 I position myself as a women&#8217;s studies scholar taking a walk across the campus to see what evidence is being produced by &#8216;the opposition&#8217;. To place my walk in context, I first briefly explore various feminist approaches to the problem of biological sex differences, and the continuing difficulties surrounding binaries and binary thinking. Next, in the main part of the thesis, I review the historical and contemporary reasoning and claims made within three areas of reductionist science that are aligning at this time, and which have been reproached for promoting a return to a more biologically determinist social environment. I then take a brief excursion off campus to demonstrate the dangerous aspects of these scientific enterprises when their interpretation into popular culture is not carefully monitored. Finally, I return again to my own side of the campus to look at some of the ways feminists have already begun the work of overturning outworn and contested conventional theories about biology and human nature in conversation with reductionist theory.   
 
 Having done this, was it worth the walk? My assessment is that while, in some cases, feminism&#8217;s defensive antiessentialism is warranted, there is work being undertaken within these reductionist sciences that is less rigid and reactionary than some critical interpretation would suggest. I conclude that there is a certain futility in feminist body theory&#8217;s oppositional stance to biology, and that its utility is put at risk by a continued investment in one side of a binary. Further, my walk across the campus leads me to believe that, while perhaps not imminent, there is every reason to expect that the scientific pursuit of an unequivocal genetic basis for specific sex differentiated behaviours will succeed. That being so, there are spaces where the insights of both sides might be productively brought together so as to avoid the worst excesses of biological determinism  and, at the same time, loosen the grip of binary thinking on approaches to biology and the body.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1303/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative genomics to investigate genome function and adaptations in the newly sequenced Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli</field><field name="creator">Wanchanthuek, Phatthanaphong</field><field name="description">Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli are anaerobic intestinal spirochaetes that are the aetiological agents of swine dysentery and intestinal spirochaetosis, respectively. As part of this PhD study the genome sequence of B. hyodysenteriae strain WA1 and a near complete sequence of B. pilosicoli strain 95/1000 were obtained, and subjected to comparative genomic analysis. The B. hyodysenteriae genome consisted of a circular 3.0 Mb chromosome, and a 35,940 bp circular plasmid that has not previously been described. The incomplete genome of B. pilosicoli contained 4 scaffolds. There were 2,652 and 2,297 predicted ORFs in the B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli strains, respectively. Of the predicted ORFs, more had similarities to proteins of the enteric Clostridium species than they did to proteins of other spirochaetes. Many of these genes were associated with transport and metabolism, and they may have been gradually acquired through horizontal gene transfer in the environment of the large intestine.
 
 A reconstruction of central metabolic pathways of the Brachyspira species identified a complete set of coding sequences for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, a non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide metabolism and a respiratory electron transport chain. A notable finding was the presence of rfb genes on the B. hyodysenteriae plasmid, and their apparent absence from B. pilosicoli. As these genes are involved in rhamnose biosynthesis it is likely that the composition of the B. hyodysenteriae lipooligosaccharide O-sugars is different from that of B. pilosicoli. O-antigen differences in these related species could be associated with differences in their specific niches, and/or with their disease specificity. Overall, comparison of B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli protein content and analysis of their central metabolic pathways showed that they have diverged markedly from other spirochaetes in the process of adapting to their habitat in the large intestine.
 
 The presence of overlapping genes in the two spirochaetes and in other spirochaete species also was investigated. The number of overlapping genes in the 12 spirochaete genomes examined ranged from 11-45%. Of these, 80% were unidirectional. Overlapping genes were found irregularly distributed within the Brachyspira genomes such that 70-80% of them occurred on the same strand (unidirectional, -&gt;-&gt;/&lt;-&lt;-), with 16-28% occurring on opposite DNA strands (divergent, &lt;--&gt;).  The remaining 4-6% of overlapping genes were convergent (-&gt;&lt;-). The majority of the unidirectional overlap regions were relatively short, with &gt;50% of the total observations overlapping by &gt;4 bp. A small number of overlapping gene-pairs were duplicated within each genome and there were some triplet overlapping genes. Unique orthologous overlapping genes were identified within the various spirochaete genera. Over 75% of the overlapping genes in the Brachyspira species were in the same or related metabolic pathway. This finding suggests that overlapping genes are not only likely to be the result of functional constraints but also are constrained from a metabolomic context. Of the remaining 25% overlapping genes, 50% contained one hypothetical gene with unknown function. In addition, in one of the orthologous overlapping genes in the Brachyspira species, a promoter was shared, indicating the presence of a novel class of overlapping gene operon in these intestinal spirochaetes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1304/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a reverse genetic system for human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) and the molecular basis of its growth phenotype and adaptation to mice</field><field name="creator">Phuektes, Patchara</field><field name="description">Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) is a member of the Human Enterovirus A species within the Family Picornaviridae.  Since 1997, HEV71 has emerged as a major cause of epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) associated with severe neurological disease in the Asia-Pacific region.  At the present time, little is known about the pathogenesis of acute neurological disease caused by HEV71.  The major aim of this study was to generate infectious cDNA clones of HEV71 and use them as tools for investigating the biology of HEV71 and molecular genetics of HEV71 virulence and pathogenesis. 
 
 Two infectious cDNA clones of HEV71 clinical isolates, 26M (genotype B3) and 6F (genotype C2) were successfully constructed using a low copy number plasmid vector and an appropriate bacterial host.  Transfection of cDNA clones or RNA transcripts derived from these clones produced infectious viruses.  Phenotypic characterisation of clone-derived viruses (CDV-26M and CDV-6F) was performed, and CDV-26M and CDV-6F were found to have indistinguishable phenotypes compared to their wild type viruses. 
 
 Strains HEV71-26M and HEV71-6F were found to have distinct cell culture growth phenotypes.  To identify the genome regions responsible for the growth phenotypes of the two strains a series of chimeric viruses were constructed by exchanging the 5&#8222;S untranslated region (5&#8222;S UTR), structural protein (P1), and nonstructural protein (P2 and P3) gene regions using infectious cDNA clones of both virus strains.  Analysis of reciprocal virus chimeras revealed that the 5&#8222;S UTR of both strains were compatible but not responsible for the observed phenotypes.  Both the P1 and P2-P3 genome regions influence the HEV71 growth phenotype in cell culture, phenotype expression is dependent on specific P1/P2-P3 combinations and is not reciprocal. 
 
 In the previous study, in order to investigate the pathogenesis of HEV71 infection, a mouse HEV71 model was developed using a mouse-adapted variant of HEV71-26M.  Mouse-adapted strain MP-26M caused fore- and/or hindlimb paralysis in mice, whereas HEV71-26M-infected mice did not develop clinical signs of infection at any virus dose or route of inoculation tested.  In this study, the molecular basis of mouse adaptation by HEV71 was identified.  Nucleotide sequence analysis of HEV71-26M and MP-26M revealed three point mutations in the open reading frame, each resulting in an amino acid substitution in the VP1, VP2 and 2C proteins; no mutations were identified in the untranslated regions of the genome.  To determine which of the three amino acid mutations were responsible for the adaptation and virulence of HEV71-26M in mice, recombinant cDNA clones containing one, or a combination of two or three mutations, were constructed.  Mouse virulence assays of the mutated viruses clearly demonstrated that a non-conservative amino acid substitution (G710&#8222;_E) in the capsid protein VP1 alone was sufficient to confer the mouse virulence phenotype on HEV71. 
 
 In addition, a mouse oral infection model was established in this study.  Oral inoculation with the mouse-adapted HEV71 virus, MP-26M, induced fore-or hindlimb paralysis in newborn mice in an age- and dose-dependent manner.  As oral transmission is the natural route of HEV71 infection, this murine HEV71 oral infection model will provide a suitable tool for studying HEV71 pathogenesis, for defining neurological determinants, and for testing vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity in the future.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1306/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silicon Nanowires for Photvoltaic Applications</field><field name="creator">Parlevliet, David</field><field name="description">Silicon nanowires are a nanostructure consisting of elongated crystals of silicon. Like many nanostructures, silicon nanowires have properties that change with size. In particular, silicon nanowires have a band-gap that is tuneable with the diameter of the nanowire. They tend to absorb a large portion of the light incident upon them and they form a highly textured surface when grown on an otherwise flat substrate. These properties indicate silicon nanowires are good candidates for use in solar cells.
 
 Nanostructured silicon, in the form of nanocrystalline silicon, has been used to produce thin film solar cells. Solar cells produced using silicon nanowires could combine the properties of the silicon nanowires with the low material costs and good stability of nanocrystalline based solar cells.
 
 This thesis describes the process of optimisation of silicon nanowire growth on a plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition system. This optimised growth of silicon nanowires is then used to demonstrate a prototype solar cell using silicon nanowires and amorphous silicon. Several steps had to be accomplished to reach this goal.
 
 The growth of silicon nanowires was optimised through a number of steps to produce a high density film covering a substrate. Developments were made to the standard deposition technique and it was found that by using pulsed plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition the density of nanowire growth could be improved. Of a range of catalysts trialled, gold and tin were found to be the most effective catalysts for the growth of silicon nanowires. A range of substrates was investigated and the nanowires were found to grow with high density on transparent conductive oxide coated glass substrates, which would allow light to reach the nanowires when they were used as part of a solar cell. The silicon nanowires were combined with doped and intrinsic amorphous silicon layers with the aim to create thin film photovoltaic devices. Several device designs using silicon nanowires were investigated. The variant that showed the highest efficiency used doped silicon nanowires as a p-layer which was coated with intrinsic and n-type amorphous silicon.
 
 By the characterisation and optimisation of the silicon nanowires, a prototype silicon nanowire solar cell was produced. The analysis of these prototype thin film devices, and the nanowires themselves, indicated that silicon nanowires are a promising material for photovoltaic applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1308/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the rule of law on the implementation of the convention on the rights of the child in Indonesia and Australia</field><field name="creator">Susantijo, Susi</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (&#8216;the CRC&#8217;) in Indonesia: The chasm between theory and practice. Despite the enactment of several laws and regulations aimed at protecting the rights of the child, Indonesia&#8217;s implementation of children&#8217;s rights remains very limited. The theme of this thesis is that, despite the existence of adequate written laws, a state can fail to achieve an effective implementation of human rights, as exemplified by Indonesia. This thesis will focus on the impact of the rule of law on the holistic well-being of children, a group that Indonesia has acknowledged plays &#8216;a strategic role&#8217; and is in a &#8216;unique position [to ensure] the continued existence of the nation&#8217;.
 
 The development of the rule of law and its impact on the implementation of the CRC in Indonesia will be compared to Australia, a state where the CRC has been much better implemented. There is an inextricable link between the rule of law and human rights. The prevailing view is that the rule of law does not depend on written laws; the rule of law is more about the extra-legal aspects of a society, such as culture, socio-economic factors and political factors. In the absence of the rule of law, human rights can only be selectively implemented and enforced.
 
 The rights of the child are a global human rights issue, which is particularly pertinent to Indonesia, a nation with a poor record for implementing children&#8217;s rights. Children&#8217;s rights are well established in international law, largely due to the adoption of the CRC. The CRC has provided the greatest contribution to the field of children&#8217;s rights and will serve as the focus of this thesis. Apart from being the most universally ratified human rights convention in history, the CRC expressly recognises a range of children&#8217;s rights including civil, political, socio-economic and cultural rights. More importantly, the CRC shifted the responsibility for implementing children&#8217;s rights from parents and local communities to State Parties. The CRC is thus an advanced tool for assessing the standard of children&#8217;s rights internationally and for implementing change, and will be used to compare the current status of children&#8217;s rights in Indonesia and Australia.
 
 Arguably, the issue of children&#8217;s rights is complex and the implementation of children&#8217;s rights requires a multifaceted approach. This thesis will conclude with recommendations on how Indonesia can move forward to achieve a better implementation of children&#8217;s rights.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1655/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of Phytophthora cinnamomi on the distribution of the yellow-footed antechinus (mardo) (Antechinus flavipes leucogaster) (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae)</field><field name="creator">Armistead , Rodney James</field><field name="description">This is the first study to investigate and provide definitive evidence that the plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi is a significant threat to the mammal fauna of Western Australia. This study investigated the impact of P. cinnamomi-induced habitat disturbance and degradation on Antechinus flavipes leucogaster (yellow-footed antechinus) or mardo. Phytophthora cinnamomi is an introduced and invasive soil-borne plant pathogen that kills many common and structurally important plant species, which results in significant changes to the structural characteristics of affected areas. An evaluation of P. cinnamomi affected and unaffected areas of the northern jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest revealed significant declines in the structure, composition and complexity of all areas affected by P. cinnamomi. Dieback Expression Score values ranged from a mean value of 1.88 &#177; 1.01 to 3.8 &#177; 0.41 at the P. cinnamomi affected sites, indicating a high degree of disturbance. A non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis using 16 habitat variables identified significant (ANISOM: R=0.343, P&lt;0.003) separation among affected and unaffected sites. A SIMPER analysis revealed that ground and shrub cover vegetation, small and total log densities, percentage leaf litter cover, and the densities of small, medium, tall single crowned and total Xanthorrhoea preissii were the greatest contributors separating affected and unaffected areas.
 
 Presently, our understanding of how P. cinnamomi affects the fauna of Western Australia is limited. This providing a unique opportunity to examine how P. cinnamomi-induced disturbance impacts upon the mardo. The mardo is a small insectivorous marsupial that is regarded as being common and a habitat generalist that occupies a broad range of forest and woodland habitats throughout the south-west of Western Australia. Until the present study, the specific habitat requirements, and therefore the factors limiting the present distribution of the mardo have received little attention. Therefore, in addition to being the first study to evaluate the impact of P. cinnamomi on Western Australian fauna, this study also provides important information about the present distribution of the mardo.
 
 Detection-nondetection mark-release surveys conducted in P. cinnamomi affected and unaffected regions of the northern jarrah forest, revealed that although, mardos were recorded at most sites, the number of mardo individuals, captures and detections were considerably lower at P. cinnamomi affected areas. Patch Occupancy analysis, using an information theoretic approach, revealed that the probability of a mardo occupying a region of the northern jarrah forest affected by P. cinnamomi ranged from a likelihood of 0.0 to 25.0%, while in contrast there was a 41.0 to 51.0% likelihood of a mardo occurring among unaffected regions. This discovery supports the hypothesis that P. cinnamomi-induced habitat disturbance impacts upon the distribution of the mardo.
 
 An evaluation of the micro-habitat features important to the mardo using Patch Occupancy modelling using an information theoretic approach identified large logs and X. preissii densities as positive contributors to the present distribution of the mardo in the northern jarrah forest. Indeed, the likelihood of a mardo occupying an area with large logs and dense patches of X. preissii ranged from 62.2% to 85.0%. In contrast, in the P. cinnamomi affected sites with lower X. preissii densities the patch occupancy probabilities ranged from 0.0% to 45.7%. Logs and X. preissii strongly contribute to the understorey and may increase nest locations and cover while offering protection from predators. Mardos may avoid P. cinnamomi affected areas because of lower X. preissii densities, which may result in fewer nest locations, reduced cover and an increased likelihood of predation. However, the results of the study must be treated as preliminary findings, therefore there may be additional environmental related or unrelated to P. cinnamomi factors that may also contribute to the occupancy rates of the mardo. Therefore, further studies and research on the ecology and biology of the mardo is strongly encouraged. Until this research is conducted, P. cinnamomi most be considered as significant threat to the conservation of the mardo. Therefore, the conservation of the mardo in the northern jarrah forest depends on limiting the spread and impact of P. cinnamomi, as well as the retention of large logs and tall X. preissii. Given that large logs and tall X. preissii contribute to the distribution of the mardo, strong consideration must be given to using these natural elements to rehabilitate the most severely disturbed areas of the northern jarrah forest.
 
 Consideration must be given to the conservation of other small and threatened mammal species that inhabit susceptible plant communities in the south-west of Western Australia. An understanding of how P. cinnamomi impacts on the mardo and other native mammals will contribute to our ability to control, protect and manage vulnerable communities and ecosystems in Western Australia. If the spread and impact of this pathogen is left unchecked, the ultimate consequence to the conservation of many small to medium native mammals that are dependant on structurally complex habitat may be devastating.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1656/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A longitudinal study of beginning teachers' pedagogical identity and their use of ICT</field><field name="creator">Bate, Frank</field><field name="description">The educational policy environment in Australia explicitly supports the integration of information and communications technologies (ICT) through targeted initiatives covering infrastructure, equipment, electronic learning materials and professional development. However, for all the energy expended to encourage teachers to use ICT, it is reported that few teachers take full advantage of the significant opportunities that ICT present. A number of reasons have been cited to explain this, the most compelling of which are bound up with teachers&#8217; knowledge and skills in harnessing ICT and their beliefs about ICT and teaching itself.
 
 This research presents a three year longitudinal study of a cohort of 35 beginning teachers located in Western Australia. The focus on beginning teachers is purposeful. It is suggested that this segment of the teaching profession can provide useful insights into the affordances and risks that teachers face in harnessing ICT. Beginning teachers may also provide a window into how ICT will be taken up in the future. The aim of the research, therefore, is to describe and explain beginning teachers&#8217; beliefs, knowledge, dispositions and skills in using ICT within the context of their school environment(s).
 
 The research literature characterises beginning teachers as having positive self-perceptions of their ability to use ICT, and embracing contemporary, student-centred theories of learning. Given these preconditions, it might seem likely that beginning teachers would seek to integrate ICT into their teaching in innovative ways. The seven research questions that underpin and guide the research are aimed, at least in part, at confirming or challenging this assertion.
 
 The study adopts a mixed method approach in seeking to understand and interpret the dynamic nature of participants&#8217; beliefs about teaching and their knowledge, dispositions and skills in using ICT within their socio-cultural context. A rich data set, gathered over three years and using qualitative and quantitative techniques, is presented to provide evidence in relation to the study&#8217;s research questions. The longitudinal nature of the study provides opportunities to interpret this data set over time, adding to the strength and credibility of the research.
 
 Participants articulated pedagogical beliefs that aimed to engage students in active meaning making. However, the way in which participants used ICT was generally limited to presentation-style teaching, completion of worksheets using a narrow range of productivity software and the use of the World Wide Web for simple inquiries or reinforcement. There was a clear mismatch between the ideals that participants claimed to hold to be important and their capacity to use ICT to help realise these ideals. Four interrelated factors are posited to explain this: lack of clarity over beliefs and how ICT can support these beliefs; variability of perceptions within schools of the affordances and risks of using ICT; embedded structural constraints that stall the creative use of ICT; and, deficiencies in technological-pedagogical-content knowledge.
 
 The study may interest educational policy-makers, school leaders, managers, teachers and other learning professionals that are considering how to conceptualise, plan, implement and/or enhance the use of ICT within their local context. A model is presented to help educators grapple with the implications of using ICT in the classroom and explore its transformative potential.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1657/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psittacine beak and feather disease : vaccination, haematological response and pcr methodology</field><field name="creator">Bonne, Nicolai Johnsen</field><field name="description">To enable assessment of recombinant BFDV capsid protein (recBFDVcap) for vaccination to protect against PBFD, commercially available lovebirds (Agapornis sp.) were tested for evidence of past and current BFDV infection using PCR, HI and HA to identify suitable BFDV-free birds in which to test the vaccine. During this attempt, it was found that lovebirds from commercial aviaries were endemically infected with BFDV with evidence of up to 100% prevalence of BFDV DNA in blood samples from individual birds over time. Such an approach was abandoned as unlikely to yield suitable numbers of na&#239;ve birds to conduct a BFDV vaccination trial.  
 
 As commercially available lovebirds were considered to be a poor source of BFDV-free birds, wild caught cockatoo nestlings and eggs (long-billed corella; Cacatua tenuirostris and galah; Eolophus roseicapillus) were used to assess the efficacy of BFDV vaccination using baculovirus recombinant BFDV capsid. Eggs were artificially incubated and 3 eggs successfully hatched and 1 was successfully hand-reared. All nestlings were screened for BFDV DNA in blood using PCR upon arrival then on days 11, 18 and 25 and tested for anti-BFDV antibody on the day of arrival. All hatched birds were determined to be free of BFDV DNA and BFDV HI antibody in the peripheral blood throughout the hand rearing period and the flock was considered to be suitable for a BFDV vaccination trial.
 
 Corellas (n=13) were injected with 1 mL of vaccine containing 10 &#956;g recBFDVcap on day 0 and 0.4 mL vaccine containing 66.8 &#956;g recBFDVcap on day 11. All vaccinated corellas and 5 non-vaccinated control corellas were given 0.4 mL BFDV suspension (titre = log2 12 HAU/50 &#956;L) intramuscularly and 0.1 mL orally 16 days after booster vaccination. Blood was collected periodically during the vaccination period and blood and feathers collected before and after BFDV administration. Testing included BFDV DNA detection by PCR and qRT PCR (on blood) as well as serum antibody detection by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and BFDV DNA and antigen was detected by qRT PCR and haemagglutination (HA) (on feathers), respectively. Four of 97 blood samples collected from vaccinated birds post BFDV challenge tested positive by PCR, whereas 17 of 35 samples taken from non-vaccinated control corellas tested positive. Vaccinated birds did not develop feather lesions, had only transient PCR detectable viraemia and had no evidence of persistent infection 270 days post-challenge using PCR, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Non-vaccinated control corellas developed transient feather lesions and PCR, HI and HA test results consistent with PBFD. They were BFDV PCR positive for up to 41 days post-challenge and qRT PCR demonstrated reduced virus replication in vaccinated birds compared to non-vaccinated control birds. Thus, administration of recBFDVcap vaccine alone was found to incite an adaptive immune response in BFDV-free corellas that subsequently conferred protection against inoculation with BFDV.
 
 A commonly utilized method for excising blood dried on filter paper was proven to be of high risk of carryover contamination facilitated by a hole punch used for processing several samples. Therefore a practical method of avoiding carryover contamination was developed and used in the DNA testing procedures of the vaccination trial.
 
 Finally, the haematological characteristics of the above mentioned cockatoos were studied before and for 97 days after experimental infection with BFDV. It was found that the pre-challenge haematological values were similar between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated corellas. Most pre-challenge parameters were comparable to previously reported values of other cockatoos and psittacine birds. Significant differences were seen in both groups when comparing pre-challenge values with post challenge values for total and differential leukocyte concentrations, but PCV and TSP were not significantly affected by BFDV challenge.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1658/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for capacity development: closing the gap between theory and practice</field><field name="creator">Boyd, Davina</field><field name="description">Capacity development has long been considered a cornerstone of development. While the development industry&#8217;s commitment to capacity development has been fraught with debate about its ambiguous nature and lack of associated success, after more than thirty years of experience, there is now widespread agreement that capacity development is a priority for development. There is also renewed understanding that an alternative development paradigm is at the core of capacity development and core principles and good practice guidelines are emerging. However, while there has been a transformation in thinking, much of the development industry is entrenched in existing practices and there remains a gap between the theory that is espoused and capacity development in practice.
 
 Currently, the development industry is in transition. This transition is necessary and unavoidable if the development challenges faced by billions of people are to be addressed. This research sought to identify ways to facilitate this transition and close the gap between theory and practice. The research was underpinned by a pragmatic philosophical perspective. As such, a central aim of the research was to make a practical contribution to improving practice.
 
 A design-based research methodology was used to carry out research into the practice of delivering two capacity development interventions: 1) the Public Sector Linkages Program (PSLP) Project; and, 2) the Sustainable Sanitation and Wetlands Technology (SSWT) Project.  These interventions were designed to develop Indonesian capacity in water and sanitation. In design-based research, practice and research are carried out concurrently. This methodology provided an opportunity to advance understanding of the relationship between capacity development theory based on the alternative paradigm and improved practice.
 
 A Framework for Capacity Development is the main outcome of this research. The Framework provides specific guidance regarding the design of capacity development interventions based on the alternative paradigm. The Framework was found to facilitate the design of interventions with improved processes and outcomes. Further application of the Framework in different contexts is recommended.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1659/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Located Stories: Theatre Makes Place with the Body</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Angela Louise</field><field name="description">The journey into theatre-made places offered here is both analytical and creative. It is comprised of case studies analysing three theatre productions that occurred in Perth between 2004 and 2006 and two of my own creative works, forming the Prologue and Conclusion to the thesis. Throughout, I am informed by Edward Casey&#8217;s philosophy of place as I work to develop both a poetics and a dramaturgy of place in theatre. I draw upon of a range of thinkers in order to interrogate the limits of theatrical representation and to suggest that an active engagement in the process of place-making in theatre offers a touchstone and paradigm that can release both thought and the body from totalizing and foreclosing cultural imperatives. This dramaturgical and poetical journey into place works, I hope, toward creating an open and dynamic field from which to experience the &#8216;here and now&#8217; of being in place in theatre, and in the world. I argue that the notion of place as embodied meaning frames the body and the mind in contexts that are personal, emotional, historical, ethical, and political; that to be in place, to be aware that one&#8217;s body is a particular place, suggests that the body and mind are listening to each other. This conscious connection, I believe, offers a radical challenge to the bifurcation of body and mind that runs as a consistent theme throughout the history of Western thought. More particularly, I aim to demonstrate that a voyage  into place, in theatre, conveys the body and mind together in ways that allow us to &#8220;resume the direction, and regain the depth, of our individual and collective life once again &#8211; and know it for the first time&#8221; (Casey, 1993: 314).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1660/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models, processes, and factors influencing internationalisation: the case of Malaysian smes</field><field name="creator">Che Senik, Zizah</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the processes and influential factors affecting the internationalisation of SMEs in manufacturing industries in Malaysia. Internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been widely researched but little is known of how and why internationalisation takes place in developing countries and this lack of evidence in the literature provides strong grounds for this study. Jones and Coviello (2005) suggest investigation of internationalisation should include the broad range of internationalisation theories, such as the Incremental and Rapid internationalisation models, Networking, Resource-based and International Entrepreneurship perspectives. These perspectives examine the awareness, process, driving forces and influential factors relevant to SME internationalisation. Therefore, the patterns and dimensions of internationalisation, including the modes of foreign entry, market selection, triggering factors, awareness of international opportunities were investigated, as were the problems and challenges faced by internationalising firms and the key drivers influencing the internationalisation process.
 
 A critical realism paradigm and qualitative method were employed. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 Malaysian experts and 54 Malaysian-based CEOs, owners, and/ or key executives from SME manufacturing industries using a semi-structured interview guide. The data was analysed with the statistical package NVivo 7 and also manually to improve triangulation of the results. The results are largely inductive and interpretive and are presented in qualitative-themes as well as some basic statistical analyses.
 
 The findings indicate that interrelated factors influence the internationalisation process of Malaysian SMEs. Various paces, a myriad of entry modes and broad market scopes determine the pattern of internationalisation undertaken. A traditional internationalisation pattern is strongly evident, although some companies exhibited rapid and born global patterns, depending on their industry, products, organisational competencies, knowledge and access to information or because of a change of management. The main drivers of internationalisation centred on key personnel and firm competencies. The study also found that while domestic and global forces motivate internationalisation, aspects of Government policy, procedures and international requirements inhibit the process. More importantly, the findings suggest that networking relationships create internationalisation awareness and provide appropriate pathways to internationalisation for manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia and this is an area where strategies could be improved. The increasing emphasis on the SME sector for enhancing economic and social development in Malaysia means they can make substantial contributions to development and understanding how to improve internationalisation strategies will increase those gains. More transparent government policies and coherence among supporting agencies as well as structured and relevant networks would assist the internationalisation of Malaysian SMEs. Currently, internationalisation processes are constrained by limited resources and difficulty in accessing assistance and supports. This study provides new knowledge and important insights that will benefit manufacturing and other industries in Malaysia and other developing countries.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1661/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of the ichthyofaunas of offshore waters in different types of estuary in Western Australia, including the biology of Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri</field><field name="creator">Chuwen, Benjamin</field><field name="description">This thesis has addressed the following three main areas of research. 1) The physico-chemical characteristics of eight selected estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia that represent different estuary types, 2) the ichthyofaunal characteristics of the basin and riverine regions of offshore, deeper waters of five of those estuaries and 3) aspects of the biology of the iconic Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri in each of those estuaries in which it was abundant.
 
 Although four of the estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia remain permanently open to the ocean, the others only become open when the volume of river discharge is sufficient to breach the prominent sand bars that form at their mouths. The sand bars of the latter estuaries are breached either annually following heavy winter and early spring rainfall (seasonally-open estuaries) or infrequently after exceptionally heavy discharge (normally-closed estuaries). The work for this thesis was undertaken in the permanently-open Oyster Harbour, the seasonally-open Broke, Irwin and Wilson inlets and the normally-closed Wellstead Estuary and Hamersley, Culham and Stokes inlets, which are all located within a ca 500 km stretch of coastline.
 
 In permanently and seasonally-open estuaries, pronounced haloclines and oxyclines were present in their narrow riverine regions, but not in their wide basins where the waters are subjected to wind-driven mixing. The extent of cyclical seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions differed markedly among the three seasonally-open estuaries and between years in one of those systems. These differences reflected variations in the relationship between the volume of fluvial discharge, which is determined by a combination of the amount of local rainfall, catchment size and extent of clearing of native vegetation, and the amount of intrusion by marine waters, which is largely controlled by the size and duration of the opening of the estuary mouth. The mean seasonal salinities in the basins of three of the normally-closed estuaries increased over three years of very low rainfall to 64 in the deepest estuary (Stokes Inlet) to 145 in Hamersley Inlet and to 296 in the shallowest estuary (Culham Inlet). Gill netting seasonally for two years at sites in the basin and saline lower reaches of the main tributary of the seasonally-open Broke, Irwin and Wilson inlets, the permanently-open Oyster Harbour and the normally-closed Wellstead Estuary yielded 22 329 fishes representing 58 species. Overall, and irrespective of estuary type, the species compositions of the basins and rivers differed markedly. This was attributable to consistently greater abundances of Mugil cephalus, and usually also of A. butcheri, in the riverine region of each estuary and to the restriction of a range of species largely to the basins. However, the ichthyofaunal compositions in the basins of the five estuaries varied markedly, reflecting, in part, differences in the extent and duration of the opening of the estuary mouth and/or whether extensive growths of macrophytes were present. Changes in the ichthyofaunal composition of the normally-closed Wellstead Estuary between the first and second years of the study were attributable, in particular, to the movement of two mugilid species into offshore waters as they increased in size. Cyclical changes in ichthyofaunal composition were conspicuous in both the basin and riverine regions of the estuary that underwent the most pronounced seasonal variations in environmental conditions. In each estuary, species richness was greater in the basin than river, where salinities were more variable and fell to lower levels and were thus less conducive to the immigration of most marine species. Catch rates were least in Broke Inlet, which had the lowest primary productivity, and were particularly high in Wellstead Estuary, which is highly eutrophic.
 
 The maximum ages of Acanthopagrus butcheri ranged downwards from 13 to 15 years in Wilson Inlet, Wellstead Estuary, Culham Inlet and Stokes Inlet, 9 years in Oyster Harbour and only 5 years in Irwin Inlet and Hamersley Inlet. Growth of A. butcheri varied markedly among the various estuaries, probably reflecting differences in the density of A. butcheri, quality/quantity of food and/or salinity regime. The relationship between fish length and otolith radius varied between sexes and among estuaries. The width of the annual growth zones of otoliths was shown, however, to vary among years, particularly in Stokes Inlet, in which the growth zones were widest in years of relatively high rainfall and thus when salinities were presumably below that of full-strength sea water. The trends exhibited throughout the year by the gonadosomatic indices and the prevalences of each of the sequential stages in gonadal development demonstrate that A. butcheri spawns mainly in spring in estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia. The lengths at maturity (L50s) of A. butcheri in the four estuaries from which it was possible to obtain substantial reproductive data were not significantly different (all p &gt; 0.05), with the values for females, for example, ranging only from 146-161 mm. While no fish matured at the end of their first year of life in those estuaries, the majority of fish did mature at the end of their second year of life (73-100%). The vast majority or all fish were mature by 200 mm, which is well below the minimum legal length (MLL) for retention of this species in Western Australia, thus providing the potential for all fish that survive to the MLL to reproduce before being legally retained. Recruitment of A. butcheri varied markedly among years and estuaries. Recruitment in the seasonally-open Wilson Inlet was greatest in years of below average rainfall and thus presumably also relatively elevated salinities and reduced stratification and associated deoxygenation of the bottom water layer in the rivers. Although massive mortalities of A. butcheri in two of the normally-closed estuaries prevented comparisons across this estuary type, it appears that strong recruitment in these estuaries is related to years of relatively high rainfall and presumably the lowering of salinities in these estuaries to below that of full-strength sea water. Total mortality (Z) of A. butcheri appeared to be slightly higher in estuaries with the greatest fishing pressure.
 
 The species composition and diversity of the diets of A. butcheri in three normally-closed estuaries, i.e. Hamersley, Culham and Stokes inlets, which vary markedly in the extents to which they become hypersaline during dry periods, were compared. Although a wide range of taxa, including macrophytes, polychaetes, molluscs, crustaceans, insects and teleosts, were ingested by A. butcheri in each estuary, the frequencies of ingestion and volumetric dietary contributions of these taxa varied greatly among the fish in these estuaries. Thus, for example, relatively greater contributions were made to the diet by polychaetes and crustaceans in Stokes Inlet, by macrophytes in Hamersley Inlet, and by insects (mainly chironomid larvae) in Culham Inlet. The relatively greater contribution of teleosts to the diets of A. butcheri in the Hamersley and Culham inlets than in Stokes Inlet, and also differences in the main teleost species ingested in the first two estuaries, are consistent with differences in the densities of fish overall and of the main fish species in those estuaries. The diversity of the diet was far greater in Stokes Inlet than in the other two far more variably saline estuaries, presumably reflecting a greater diversity of food. The dietary compositions of A. butcheri in upstream pools in the tributary of Culham Inlet, which offer refuge when salinities increase markedly in the main body of the estuary, differed from those in downstream regions, further emphasising the opportunistic nature of the feeding behaviour of A. butcheri. The dietary compositions of A. butcheri underwent size-related changes, but the taxa contributing most to those changes varied greatly among estuaries. Size-related changes would be particularly beneficial in reducing intraspecific competition for food in the two estuaries that vary greatly in salinity and would thus be likely to contain a less diverse range of prey.
 
 In summary, this thesis has demonstrated that the physico-chemical characteristics of estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia vary markedly even among estuaries of the same type, i.e. seasonally open and normally closed, and has elucidated the basis for those differences. While the characteristics of the ichthyofaunas in the offshore waters of the various estuaries on that coast differ markedly, those differences were not as marked as the overall difference between the basin and riverine regions of those systems. Finally, the iconic Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri is characterised by very different growth and recruitment patterns in the various estuaries and highly opportunistic feeding behaviour. The great plasticity of A. butcheri helps account for the success of this species in the range of very different environments found in south coast estuaries.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1662/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hemispheric Contributions to Language Comprehension: Word and Message-level Processing Mechanisms of the Right Cerebral Hemisphere</field><field name="creator">Gouldthorp, Bethanie</field><field name="description">Recent research into hemispheric differences in sentence comprehension has produced a puzzling disparity between the results from behavioral studies on neurologically normal individuals and studies utilizing other methods such as electrophysiology, neuroimaging and the investigation of neuropsychological patients. The former approach tends to produce results that indicate a restriction of the right hemisphere (RH) to lower-level processing mechanisms that are comparatively less sensitive to context than the left hemisphere (LH), while the combined findings of the latter approaches suggest that not only is the RH capable of processing language at a higher level, it is particularly sensitive to contextual information and, furthermore, this may form part of the special role of the RH in language tasks.  Accordingly, the present series of studies employed a normal-behavioral approach to further investigate the underlying processing mechanisms of the RH during sentence comprehension tasks.  In each of the four experiments, right-handed adult participants completed a computer-based lexical decision task where reaction time and error rates were recorded.  Stimuli were always centrally-presented, followed by a laterally-presented target word or non-word. In the first experiment, the sensitivity of the RH to message-level meaning was investigated by assessing whether it benefits from additional contextual information in sentences that was not the result of simple word-level associations.  The remaining experiments aimed to examine several current models of RH language processing; specifically, they examined the applicability of the coarse-coding hypothesis (Beeman, 1993) and the integrative processing model (Federmeier, 2007) to RH sentence processing.  The combined results of the four experiments lead to several conclusions. Firstly, this series of investigation consistently demonstrated that the RH does display a sensitivity to message-level processing that appears to be at least equivalent to that of the LH.  This conclusion is uncommon in the normal-behavioral literature, but is consistent with evidence produced by other methodologies.  Secondly, the coarse-coding hypothesis is insufficient in explaining RH language processing at the sentential level.  Although there is considerable evidence in support of the coarse-coding model of RH processing of individual words, the findings of the present investigations do not support its applicability beyond this level.  Thirdly, the integrative/predictive distinction between RH/LH language processing also appears to have limited applicability beyond sentence fragments and may instead be reflective of higher-level processing differences (e.g., wherein the RH may utilize a para-linguistic situation-model processing method whereas the LH may rely purely on a linguistic mechanism).  Based on these conclusions, the present series of investigations appears to have resolved the inconsistent finding previously prominent in normal-behavioral literature and goes some way in determining the applicability of current models of RH language processing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1663/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qohelet's Philosophies of Death</field><field name="creator">Imray, Kathryn</field><field name="description">This thesis arises at the meeting place of a philosophical and a thanatological treatment of the book of Qohelet. A philosophical treatment is defended on the grounds of previous studies of the type of thinking evidenced in the text, as well as a comparison with ancient notions of philosophy which suggest that philosophy concerns the type of questions asked, the method of answering the questions, the answers to the questions, and the purpose of the endeavour. A thanatological treatment is defended both on the grounds of previous studies of the text as well as on the grounds of clear evidence that the text is very concerned with the issue of death. From a philosophical perspective it is assumed the book says something about such themes as beauty, knowledge, states of being, ethics, and the benefits of a philosophical outlook. These philosophical categories are combined with the text&#8217;s thanatology. The thesis therefore presents: a death aesthetic, in which death can be beautiful; an epistemology of death, in which we are shown to possess certain knowledge of our own mortality in contrast to the lack of understanding we possess about the events of life; a phenomenology of death, or a study of the state of being dead, in which it is seen that death can only ever be the object of our gaze, and we can never experience our own death; an ethics of death, or more precisely an ethics of suicide, in which it is asked, if suicide is appropriate, under what conditions it is better to be dead than alive; and, finally, the death-based nature of the philosophy itself, in which it is seen that one cannot be wise without thinking on death, and that such thoughts confer a particular sort of life on the wise person.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1664/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating a Practical Legal Framework for the Commercial Exploitation of Mineral Resources in Outer Space</field><field name="creator">Lee, Ricky</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the legal and policy issues relating to what may be the most exciting prospect in the history of the human civilisation: the commercial exploitation of natural resources in outer space. The thesis is based on the hypothesis that such ventures are inhibited not by physical, technological and economic factors, but by the inadequacies and uncertainties present in the current body of space law and policy. Consequently, a new international legal framework and a policy consensus are required to provide a legal environment favourable for such a valuable and necessary development.
 
 To substantiate this hypothesis, the thesis begins by establishing the economic necessity and technical feasibility of space mining today, an estimate of the financial commitments required. This is followed by a risk analysis of a typical commercial mining venture in space, identifying the economic and legal risks. This leads to the recognition that the legal risks must be minimised to enable such enormous financial commitments to be made.
 
 What then follows is a detailed analysis of the legal framework for such activities as well as identifying the inadequacies of space law for the commercial exploitation of celestial resources. This is achieved through a discussion of the general principles of international space law, particularly dealing with state responsibility and international liability, as well as some of the issues arising from space mining activities. Much detail is devoted to the analysis of the content of the &#8220;common heritage of mankind&#8221; doctrine in international law and the effect of international disagreement over its application to celestial bodies.
 
 Having established the relevant legal issues, the thesis then turns to consider the past failures in reach similar agreements and the competing policy interests that have prevented the success of such agreements. It attempts to balance such interests in creating a legal and policy compromise that may be acceptable to a majority of the international community and provide some practical proposals on the structural, procedural, administrative and judicial aspects of creating and implementing a new legal framework.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1665/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of giardia and cryptosporidium infections in feedlot cattle in Western Australia and Alberta, Canada</field><field name="creator">Ralston, Brenda</field><field name="description">A comparative study of the parasites Cryptosporidium andersoni and Giardia duodenalis in feedlot cattle in Western Australia (n=502) and Alberta, Canada (n=852) was conducted. The objectives were to determine the prevalence, infection patterns and impact on cattle performance of these protozoan parasites. Utilizing molecular tools G. duodenalis was genotyped and C. andersoni samples were confirmed positive.
 
 C. parvum was absent from all cattle sampled in Alberta, Canada and Western Australia, likely due to the advanced age of the cattle being sampled (6-36 months of age). No C. bovis or C. ryanae were observed in the study cattle.
 
 C. andersoni was present in 25% of the groups of feedlot cattle sampled in Western Australia with a prevalence range of 0-26% and in all 3 of the Alberta, Canada study groups with a prevalence range of 2.9-12%. All three Alberta, Canada studies collected performance data, however, there was no significant difference between infected and non-infected steers&#8217; ADG in the feedlot.
 
 G. duodenalis was present in 83% of the groups sampled in Western Australia with prevalence ranging from 0&#8211;22% and all three study groups sampled in Alberta, Canada were positive with a prevalence ranging from 39&#8211;82%. The prevalence of G. duodenalis is significantly higher in the Alberta, Canada studies as compared to the Western Australia studies, probably due to climatic factors.
 
 Molecular characterization of a small number of the Alberta, Canada G. duodenalis positive samples (10) revealed 30% (3) genotype A, and 70% (7) genotype E. The same characterization of the Western Australia samples (10) showed 20%(2) genotype A, 40% (4) genotype E, 10% (1) genotype B, 10% (1) genotype C, 10% (1) genotype D and 10% (1) genotype B and E. Due to the unusual finding of genotypes C and D in cattle on such a small number of samples this result should be further studied to either confirm or refute the existence of genotypes C and D in cattle. Based on these results 30% of the animals from Alberta, Canada have the potential to be zoonoti (genotypes A and B) and 40% from the Western Australia studies.
 
 The results of this study demonstrate that C. andersoni and G. duodenalis are prevalent in the study feedlot cattle in Western Australia and Alberta, Canada however the impact of these parasites was not negative on animal performance in the Alberta, Canada studies where it was measured.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1668/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays in the Development, Methodology and Policy Prescriptions of Neoclassical Distribution Theory</field><field name="creator">Flatau, Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of revised versions of five published papers on the development of neoclassical distribution theory, in the English-speaking world together with an introduction and conclusion, which draw together the themes of the papers. The thesis covers the origins of neo-classical distribution theory in the English-speaking world in the work of Jevons and Marshall, through to the second generation of Wicksteed, Clark and Pigou, and finally on to the 1930s and the new perspectives of Hicks and Robinson.
 
 Drawing on archival sources and primary and secondary texts, these essays review the major statements on distribution theory made by key figures in the Jevonian and Marshallian marginalist traditions. The essays shed new light on the origins of neoclassical distribution theory and provide insights into the methodology of nascent neoclassical distribution theory. A drive towards a universal, all-embracing marginal productivity theory of the distribution of income characterises the work of Clark and Wicksteed, but not so Marshall. A formalist mode of analysis, which was to become the hallmark of neoclassical economics in the second half of the twentieth century, is also evident in key works of the period. However, the role of empirical evidence in theory generation and appraisal remains an undeveloped component of late nineteenth and early twentieth century neoclassical theory&#8212;Marshall again provides an exception to the general rule.
 
 There is a common adherence, among the key figures examined, to the joint proposition that competitive market wage outcomes are &#8216;fair&#8217;, but that low incomes (fair or not) are unjust when they fail to meet minimum needs standards. State remedial action (tax and expenditure policies) is required to remove such injustices. Robinson&#8217;s theory of exploitation provided an important extension to the neoclassical normative framework. She highlighted the extent to which labour may be exploited due to imperfections in both product and labour markets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1670/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of techniques to classify marine benthic habitats using hyperspectral imagery in oligotrophic, temperate waters</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Matthew</field><field name="description">There is an increasing need for more detailed knowledge about the spatial distribution and structure of shallow water benthic habitats for marine conservation and planning.  This, linked with improvements in hyperspectral image sensors provides an increased opportunity to develop new techniques to better utilise these data in marine mapping projects.  The oligotrophic, optically-shallow waters surrounding Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provide a unique opportunity to develop and apply these new mapping techniques.  The three flight lines of HyMap hyperspectral data flown for the Rottnest Island Reserve (RIR) in April 2004 were corrected for atmospheric effects, sunglint and the influence of the water column using the Modular Inversion and Processing System.  A digital bathymetry model was created for the RIR using existing soundings data and used to create a range of topographic variables (e.g. slope) and other spatially relevant environmental variables (e.g. exposure to waves) that could be used to improve the ecological description of the benthic habitats identified in the hyperspectral imagery.  A hierarchical habitat classification scheme was developed for Rottnest Island based on the dominant habitat components, such as Ecklonia radiata or Posidonia sinuosa.  A library of 296 spectral signatures at HyMap spectral resolution (~15 nm) was created from &gt;6000 in situ measurements of the dominant habitat components and subjected to spectral separation analysis at all levels of the habitat classification scheme.  A separation analysis technique was developed using a multivariate statistical optimisation approach that utilised a genetic algorithm in concert with a range of spectral metrics to determine the optimum set of image bands to achieve maximum separation at each classification level using the entire spectral library.  These results determined that many of the dominant habitat components could be separated spectrally as pure spectra, although there were almost always some overlapping samples from most classes at each split in the scheme.  This led to the development of a classification algorithm that accounted for these overlaps.  This algorithm was tested using mixture analysis, which attempted to identify 10 000 synthetically mixed signatures, with a known dominant component, on each run. The algorithm was applied directly to the water-corrected bottom reflectance data to classify the benthic habitats.   At the broadest scale, bio-substrate regions were separated from bare substrates in the image with an overall accuracy of 95% and, at the finest scale, bare substrates, Posidonia, Amphibolis, Ecklonia radiata, Sargassum species, algal turf and coral were separated with an accuracy of 70%.  The application of these habitat maps to a number of marine planning and management scenarios, such as marine conservation and the placement of boat moorings at dive sites was demonstrated.

The thesis also provides descriptions of ten previously undescribed species as well as develops and tests a habitat classification scheme for the Swan River Estuary using these biotic assemblages.
 
 The first section of my thesis has determined the ways in which the characteristics of the nematode assemblages in nearshore marine waters along the microtidal lower west coast of Australia are related to habitat type, time of year and shore-perpendicular zones. Three habitat types, which had previously been identified on the basis of a suite of enduring environmental characteristics, could be broadly described as highly sheltered from wave activity and containing dense seagrass (habitat type 1), moderately sheltered from wave activity and with sparse seagrass (habitat type 2) and relatively exposed to wave activity and with no seagrass (habitat type 6). Sampling in five consecutive seasons yielded &gt; 15 000 nematodes, representing 75 species. The number of species and densities in habitat type 1, and particularly those in its subtidal zone, were far greater than those in the other two habitat types. Both of these biotic variables underwent marked seasonal changes, declining to low levels during winter. The compositions of the assemblages differed significantly among the three habitat types, with the differences between habitat types 1 and 6 being particularly marked. Paracomesoma sipho, Dichromadora sp., Marylynnia annae and Pomponema sp., which, on the basis of their buccal cavity morphology, are assumed to feed primarily on benthic diatoms, were particularly abundant at the most sheltered habitat type, whereas Gonionchus australis, Theristus sp. and Bathylaimus australis, which are assumed to be deposit feeders, were relatively abundant at the most highly exposed habitat type. The compositions of the assemblages differed among seasons and were most discrete in spring, due to marked increases in the densities of certain species. However, differences in the compositions in the different zones of each habitat type were relatively small, presumably reflecting the influence of the small tidal regime of this region.
 
 The second component of this thesis has determined the ways in which the density, number of species, species composition and trophic structure of free-living nematode assemblages in the subtidal waters of a large microtidal estuary change spatially and temporally, and has explored whether those four biotic characteristics are related to certain environmental factors. Based on data derived from samples collected seasonally at 12 sites throughout the estuary, the densities and number of species of nematodes decreased progressively with distance from estuary mouth, to reach a minimum at sites where salinities were most variable, and then increased slightly in the uppermost part of the estuary where salinities were least. Densities were also generally greatest in spring, due largely to increases in the abundance of epistrate-grazing species at the time when the amount of primary food (microphytobenthos) peaked. The spatial distribution of the composition of the nematode assemblages was closely correlated with salinity and, to a lesser extent, grain-size composition and amount of particulate organic material in the sediment (%POM). Although species composition changed sequentially along the estuary, the change was particularly pronounced between sites above and below the area where salinities started to decline markedly and become more variable and %POM increased markedly. This reflected, in particular, far greater abundances of Spirinia parasitifera at the six downstream sites, and of Theristus sp. 1 at the six sites further upstream. Species composition underwent pronounced seasonal cyclical changes at all sites, presumably reflecting interspecific differences in the timing of peak reproduction and thus of recruitment. The trophic structure of the nematode assemblages changed both spatially and temporally in relation to the relative abundance of different food sources. Thus, for example, non-selective deposit feeders, such as Theristus sp. 1, dominated samples in the upper estuary, where %POM was by far the greatest, and was rare or absent at downstream sites. Conversely, epistrate grazers, such as species of the Chromadoridae, were most abundant at downstream sites in spring, when the density of the microphytobenthos reached its maximum.
 
 The data for the nematode assemblages in nearshore subtidal marine sediments of the lower west coast of Australia were compared with those in nearshore subtidal sediments in the upper and lower regions of the Swan River Estuary. The densities and average species richness in cores from the marine environment were much lower than in cores from both estuarine regions. However, the total number of species found in the marine environment was much greater than in the estuary. The compositions of the nematode assemblages were more variable in marine than estuarine sediments. The assemblages from the two estuarine regions were far more similar to each other than to those from the marine region at a species level, and also, but to a lesser extent, at the generic and family levels.
 
 While the trophic compositions of the nematode assemblages in the upper estuarine region was dominated by non-selective deposit feeding species and those of the lower estuarine region were dominated by epistrate grazing species during spring and non-selective deposit feeding species in other seasons, the dominant functional feeding groups varied among the sites representing the marine region. That variability presumably reflects differences in the relative contributions of the different potential food sources. Surprisingly, the trophic composition in the upper estuarine region, i.e. comprising predominantly non-selective deposit feeders, was similar to that at the very different environment of the most exposed marine site. The dominance of this feeding group at the marine site is assumed to be attributable to the fact that the only food source of any note is POM and, even then, it occurs in only small amounts. Taxonomic descriptions have been produced for ten new species of nematodes found during the ecological studies of the free-living aquatic nematofaunas of south-western Australia. These species were chosen because they were members of families for which the other species had been described and, in a number of cases, were important for distinguishing between the compositions of a priori groups. They comprised four species of Axonolaimidae, representing the genera Ascolaimus, Parascolaimus, Odontophora and Parodontophora, and six species of Desmodoridae, representing single species of Bolbonema, Eubostrichus, Catanema and Leptonemella and two species of Onyx.
 
 As a complement to the nematological study of the Swan River Estuary, a novel habitat classification system was developed and then applied in this environment. This system was based on enduring environmental characteristics and employed the relatively new multivariate statistical routines SIMPROF and LINKTREE. The applicability of habitat types produced by this classification system to biotic assemblages was tested using the data for the estuarine nematode assemblages described above. The results demonstrate that the compositions of the assemblages differed significantly among each of the habitat types defined by the classification system. While there were also significant differences between the compositions of the nematofaunas at sites belonging to the same habitat type, the extent of these differences were generally less than those between habitat types. A significant and strong correlation was also found between the spatial pattern exhibited by the environmental characteristics used to define habitat types, and that of the nematofauna.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1672/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and Function of Leukocytes in the Family Macropodidae</field><field name="creator">Hulme-Moir , Karen Lisa</field><field name="description">Leukocytes play a central role in protecting the body against infectious organisms and their research is essential for understanding the mechanisms of immunity. By studying leukocytes across a range of species, insights are provided into differing strategies employed to ensure resistance to disease. Surprisingly, the structure and function of marsupial leukocytes has received very limited study. Marsupials represent a major evolutionary pathway with distinct differences in reproduction and development from placental mammals. These differences in the life history of marsupials place unique challenges on the immune system, and differences in leukocyte structure and function could be reasonably expected. In this thesis, studies were undertaken to examine the cytochemical, ultrastructural and functional features of leukocytes from species of marsupials, belonging to the family Macropodidae (kangaroos and wallabies). The aim of these studies was to elucidate the characteristics of macropodid leukocytes and to compare and contrast these features with the known characteristics of other mammalian leukocytes.
 
 Leukocytes from two species of macropodid, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosis), formed the basis of this study with additional material provided from quokka (Setonix brachyurus), woylie (Bettongia pencillata) and red kangaroo (Macropus rufus). Staining characteristics of cells were examined following reaction with Sudan black B, peroxidase, chloroacetate esterase, naphthyl butyrate esterase, alkaline phosphatase and periodic acid-Schiff. Peroxidase and Sudan Black B reactions were similar to domestic animal species but chloroacetate esterase and naphthyl butyrate esterase were unreliable as markers for macropodid neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. Significant variation in staining for alkaline phosphatase was seen between species of macropodid. Tammar wallabies and quokka demonstrated strong neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity whereas western grey kangaroos, red kangaroos and woylies contained no activity within their leukocytes.
 Peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase cytochemistry were also assessed at the ultrastructural level with transmission electron microscopy. This allowed the identification of distinct granule populations within macropodid neutrophils. Two subcellular compartments containing alkaline phosphatase activity were identified within tammar wallaby neutrophils. These were considered equivalent to secretory vesicles and a subpopulation of specific granules. Tubular vesicles containing alkaline phosphatase were also identified within the eosinophils of tammar wallabies. These structures were a novel finding having not been reported previously in the eosinophils of other animal species.
 
 In addition to cytochemistry, the general ultrastructure of leukocytes from tammar wallabies and western grey kangaroos were reported. Results were similar to previous reports for other marsupial species. The current body of knowledge was extended by the first detailed description of the ultrastructure of basophils in a marsupial.
 
 To assess functional aspects of macropdid neutrophils, flow cytometric assays were performed examining oxidative burst responses and phagocytosis. Reactive oxygen species were generated by neutrophils from tammar wallabies and western grey kangaroos in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe or opsonised bacteria. Phagocytosis of opsonised bacteria was also measured in neutrophils from tammar wallabies, which was poor in contrast to ovine neutrophils. However, flow cytometric studies were limited by sample preparation. Further optimisation of isolation methods for tammar wallaby leukocytes should be undertaken before dogmatic conclusions are drawn.
 Overall, the results of this thesis demonstrate that, in the areas examined, the general characteristics of leukocyte structure and function of mammals are present in macropodids. However differences were identified both within and outside of the macropodid group. These differences have important ramifications for the use of &#8216;model&#8217; species in the study of leukocyte biology in marsupials. The results also provide potentially useful tools for the clinical diagnosis of haematological disease in macropodids and may be of interest to those studying comparative and evolutionary aspects of leukocyte structure and function.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1673/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical Dechlorination of Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene</field><field name="creator">James, Donny Lawrence</field><field name="description">Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCBD) is a toxic aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbon which is widely used as a fungicide, herbicide and heat transformer fluid. HCBD is resistant to microbial degradation and, therefore, persists in aquatic and soil environments worldwide. In this thesis, the ability of non-specific bacteria from various sources to dechlorinate HCBD in the presence of either acetate or lactate (as an electron donor) and cyanocobalamin (as an electron shuttle) under different conditions was investigated. Cultivating specific populations to reduce cyanocobalamin as a method to increase HCBD dechlorination rate was investigated. Also, the factors responsible for HCBD dechlorination and the stalling of dechlorination were studied. Lastly, redox potential measurement during the microbial reductive dechlorination of HCBD for online detection of ongoing dechlorination was evaluated.
 
 Findings from the Project
 &#8222;&#171; Non-specific bacteria from activated sludge, anaerobic digested effluent from municipal waste, piggery waste and sheep rumen content are able to dechlorinate HCBD in the presence of cyanocobalamin to chlorine-free C4 gases in a biochemical reaction.
 &#8222;&#171; Dechlorination was equated to the formation of completely dechlorinated end-products from HCBD dechlorination.
 &#8222;&#171; Methanogens were found to be involved in HCBD dechlorination.
 &#8222;&#171; Mediators rather than specific bacteria were responsible for the fast dechlorination rates. Results suggest that activated sludge may release synthesized mediators into the supernatant to enable enhanced HCBD dechlorination.
 &#8222;&#171; HCBD dechlorination can be monitored using oxidation reduction potential (ORP). ORP has an effect on HCBD dechlorination rate.
 
 Scientific Significance/Novelty
 The most significant finding from this research is that it demonstrates chlorine-free end-products in contrast with other studies in literature (Booker and Pavlosthasis, 2000; Bosma et al., 1994) where dechlorination was equated with disappearance of HCBD into bacterial biomass and the detection of partially dechlorinated gases such as trichlorobutadiene. It also shows that, in contrast to literature where specific bacteria (i.e., pure strains/cultures) were commonly used for the dechlorination of polychlorinated hydrocarbons, results from this thesis show that non-specific bacteria were able to dechlorinate HCBD in the presence of cyanocobalamin at rates&#402;x sufficiently high to be considered for bioremediation projects. Moreover, results demonstrate that ORP can be used to monitor HCBD dechlorination.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1674/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Realms: A Phenomenological, Socio-Cultural and Theological-Religious Studies exploration of Musical Space</field><field name="creator">Jennings , Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to explore the ways people use and interpret experience of music, the divine and interaction with other people within discrete musical spaces. This exploration takes place in two sites: a Pentecostal church in suburban Perth, Western Australia, and the West Coast Blues &amp; Roots festival, a well known music festival held annually in Fremantle, Western Australia. I have nominated these two sites as &#8220;realms&#8221; because they are spaces set up for the performance and experience of music.
 
 My primary questions about these sites relate to how people interact with music, each other and the divine within these realms. This study combines socio-cultural and theological-religious studies theories to illuminate the processes, experiences and interpretations occurring within these musical realms. This has important implications for understanding how people use and interpret music in relation to the world outside the musical realm. People use these experiences to dream and imagine the shape of ideal relationships and communities with each other and the divine presence, and to escape and transform the world outside the musical realm.
 
 In this thesis I compile data from participant observation and in-depth interviews at both sites, as well as published interviews with performers. I construct two case studies of the sites, portraying a &#8220;day in the life&#8221; of a participant in both realms. For each case study I outline ten different interpretive paradigms, five from socio-cultural theorists and five from theology and religious studies. I analyse the data using the phenomenological method, taking a component of data from the fieldwork and comparing and contrasting it with theory. At the end of each chapter I summarise the process and make some remarks relating to the implications of the study.
 
 The resulting work makes important contributions to understanding how socio-cultural studies and theological-religious studies can work together in an interdisciplinary fashion to illuminate phenomena. The study sheds light on the nature of musical &#8220;realms&#8221;, as well as &#8220;proto-religious phenomena&#8221; and &#8220;methodological agnosticism&#8221;. Further, this work presents useful contributions into the ways churches may understand and interact with spiritual experience that occurs outside of religious settings. Finally, performers and artists and community workers will benefit from the conclusions of this study on the ways in which people use music and realms to escape, transform and imagine community and society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1675/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenthood and Civilisation: An Analysis of Parenting Discourses Produced in Australia in the Inter-War Years.</field><field name="creator">Kitchens, Rachael Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates parent education literature produced in Australia in the inter-war years.  This period saw the emergence of various organisations concerned to safeguard and protect the health and well-being of children.  For example, infant health clinics were established in most states, kindergarten associations were active in promoting early childhood education, and the mental hygiene movement gained a foothold in Australia.  These associations engaged in parent education activities and produced a growing volume of literature.  This literature contained instructions relating to various aspects of child care.  Initially, advice was directed towards the management of health, but increasingly, information was provided on guiding child behaviour.   Although the care of children was the main focus of this literature, it had wider implications.  Authors provided comment on the emotional structure of family life and the patterning of parent-child relationships.  Importantly, this literature contained advice for parents in relation to the management of their own personal care and conduct.  This thesis contends that these discourses can be explained in relation to long-term changes in the history of childhood and the family, which are connected to particular developments in the structuring of social life that Norbert Elias describes as the &#8216;civilizing process&#8217;.   In particular, it is argued that the growing distance between children and adults, and the positioning of the family as the primary site for regulating, or &#8216;civilizing&#8217; the behaviour of children, can help to explicate the increasing emphasis placed on parent education in the inter-war years.   This thesis also demonstrates how an Eliasian analysis, which emphasises long-term unintended processes of change, provides an alternative to Marxist, feminist, and Foucaultian approaches that focus on social control.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1676/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese Common Knowledge, Tourism And Natural Landscapes</field><field name="creator">Li, Fung Mei Sarah</field><field name="description">Tourism in its modern garb is very new to China. Not until 1978 when the bamboo curtain was parted and the &#8216;Open Door&#8217; policies introduced was international tourism welcomed. It is only 21 years ago, in 1984, that was tourism approved by the Chinese Government as an appropriate form of economic development that could contribute to the modernization of the country.
 
 The form that tourism takes in contemporary China, especially the development and presentation of natural sights and sites, demonstrates qualities that immediately set it apart from western forms of tourism development. While there are similar aspects &#8211; all part of the ubiquitous spread of &#8216;globalization&#8217; &#8211; there is much that retains a unique Chineseness that is immediately distinctive. In analyzing the specific qualities of contemporary Chinese tourism it is argued that 4000 years of continuous culture, which has produced a body of understanding known as &#8216;Chinese common knowledge&#8217;,  has been fundamental in directing and determining the way in which natural landscapes are utilized for contemporary tourism. The values inherent in this enduring cultural heritage are an amalgamation of Confucian thought, Doaist and Buddhist theology, folklore and an extraordinarily rich literary heritage in which the poem and calligraphy are regarded as the highest art forms. They imbue every natural landscape with a cultural overlay, drawing upon the immense strength of Chinese common knowledge in ways which make many such sights and sites incomprehensible to non-Chinese visitors because no interpretation is provided - since none is needed for their Chinese viewers.
 
 One outcome of this research is the identification of a Chinese tourist gaze that has many elements which distinguish it from the western tourist gaze.  It is highly structured through sociolinguistic parameters which feature correlative and relational thinking (in which no individual entity exists in isolation but is connected to all things around it in dynamic relationships), and this has produced what I have termed &#8216;the relational tourist gaze&#8217;.  The Chinese value system also includes a degree of anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism that stands in opposition to the western biocentric approach to conservation and maintenance of &#8216;naturalness&#8217; and &#8216;wilderness.&#8217; There is a pervasive view that nature is imperfect and &#8216;man&#8217; has a responsibility to improve on nature to forge a symbiotic relationship, these sentiments summed up in the phrase known to all Chinese: &#8216;man and nature in harmony&#8217;. A significant component of a Chinese tourist gaze is thus what I have termed &#8216;the harmony gaze&#8217; that contrast strongly with current western notions about wilderness and pristine nature.
 
 This thesis defines Chineseness and Chinese common knowledge, examines the particularities of the sociolinguistics of Chinese to illustrate the way in which this cultural heritage has been transmitted down through the centuries to the present day, and then analyses the manifestation of this knowledge and its attendant values in incorporating natural landscapes - mountains, caves, rivers &#8211; in contemporary tourism in China. The result is - &#8216;Bie you tian di&#8217; &#8211; an altogether different world.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1677/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magic causality: the function of metaphor and language in the earlier verse, essays and fictions of Jorge Luis Borges, read as consitutive of a theory of generic incorporation</field><field name="creator">Lonie, Thomas Christie</field><field name="description">Borges saw narrative as the bearer of universally re-combinable elements. Although these elements seem sequential, their essential formal integrity guarantees their rearrangement to generate new narratives. The ficci&#243;n lives beyond its author. However, Borges&#8217; ontological anxieties also have a life of their own that undermines the ficci&#243;n&#8217;s assimilative potential.
 
 By developing poetic and linguistic insights Borges creates immortal text through the construction of a symbolic repertoire. Each element of the repertoire has its genesis in the author&#8217;s personal development. This history is archaeologised in the early poetry and mediated through a theory of metaphor and the reader&#8217;s interaction with the text. Borges sees no need for a Freudian reading theory. Instead he develops an antipsychological poetics. He enlists the reader as a willing participant in the text by a dual strategy of symbolic incorporation. Firstly, readers identify with characters through vicarious emotional prediction. Secondly, he refreshes the reader&#8217;s participation by presenting emblematic devices serving as sub-text to enhance symbolic participation. Together these strategies constitute a &#8216;magic causality&#8217; of negotiated textual interpretation continually operating in his narratives. But the discipline of magic causality also conceals a rhetoric of presence establishing counter-motivational effects to disturb symbolic incorporation at the level of genre.
 
 The dissertation extracts key features for scrutiny from Borges&#8217; early literary theory and criticism, elaborating them into a general aesthetic programme. It examines biographical influences in shaping his critical and creative work. It problematises his texts from the point of view of his ideas about linguistics, their identity as contributions to the genre of the ficci&#243;n, and the centrality of metaphor and analogy as interpretative strategies. I use a number of approaches for this enterprise, including biographical criticism (ontological preoccupations), substitutional analysis (temporal subjectivity), linguistic interpretation (theory of metaphor), literary criticism (readerly reception), structuralism (readerly incorporation), and deconstruction (rhetoric of suppression). The dissertation pragmatically investigates, and contests, Borges&#8217; assimilative poetics of textual presence.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1678/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydroponics system for wastewater treatment and reuse in horticulture</field><field name="creator">Oyama, Noraisha</field><field name="description">As human population increases, the need for water increases in domestic, agricultural, industrial and urban sectors. Wastewater reuse after treatment is gaining acceptance world wide, as availability of fresh water sources decreases. However, it is also important to point out social and cultural differences that still exist in different pars of the world including those where reuse of wastewater for food production or any domestic use is not yet acceptable. The major concerns with effluent reuse are primarily its impact on human health and environmental risk. As a result, effluent reuse should be undertaken with caution after careful consideration of the potential impacts and risks.
 
 This thesis examined the potential to use the hydroponics nutrient film technique to grow commercially important crops using secondary-treated domestic wastewater. The crops chosen were a fruit crop (Lycopersicon esculantum - tomato), a leafy crop (Beta vulgaris ssp. cicla - silver beet) and a flower crop (Dianthus caryophyllus - carnation). Secondary-treated domestic wastewater was chosen because of the reduced risk of pathogen and heavy metal contamination in the crops and due to the guideline requirements for use of treated effluent for food crops. The possibility of using the effluent after the hydroponics treatment for further irrigation was also studied.
 
 The ability of secondary-treated effluent to supply adequate nutrients to the crops was assessed relative to a commercially available hydroponics solution (Chapter 3). The amount of time the solution was left in the system (nutrient solution retention time) was dependant on the plant uptake of the solution. The results obtained showed that the nutrients in secondary treated effluent was adequate for the carnations, but not for the food crops. The food crops from both treatments were compared to the produce purchased from a supermarket. The food crops showed signs of nutrient deficiency, particularly nitrogen.
 
 Based on the findings of the first experiment, the nutrient solution retention time was amended to 14 days. The carnations were not tested with the shorter nutrient solution retention time (NSRT) because they performed well in the previous trial with the longer nutrient solution retention time. The edible food crops performed better and did not show signs of nutrient deficiency when the nutrient solution retention time was reduced to 14 days.
 
 Further statistical analysis was conducted with the data from Chapters 3 and 4. Nutrient and water balances were calculated and the possible reason that the plants grown in the 14-day nutrient solution retention time took up more water, was a result of increased nutrients and better growth. A simple model was constructed to calculate height of the plants using multiple regression. The model was validated against the data collected from this study.
 
 The experiment conducted in Chapter 6 determined the nutritional quality of the food crops. The harvests from the wastewater and commercially available hydroponics solution were compared to produce purchased from a supermarket and tested for total caroteniods, total soluble solids and ascorbic acid concentrations. The nutritional quality of the wastewater grown produce was comparable to those grown in the hydroponic solution and those purchased.
 
 The risk of pathogen contamination to food crops and the die-off of pathogens in the hydroponic channels were studied in Chapter 7. This was tested by spiking the commercial hydroponic medium with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and monitoring bacterial pathogen die-off in the secondary treated domestic wastewater. The pathogen quality of the crop was tested in all treatments as well as on organically grown produce found at a local supermarket. The results of this experiment did not show any contamination on the surface of the food crops or within the food crops.
 
 This study demonstrated that growing tomatoes, silver beet and carnations using secondary-treated domestic wastewater was successful when the nutrient solution retention time was adjusted to the optimum level. In arid, developing and remote communities, this system is ideal as it conserves and reuses water for commercially important crops without compromising the health of the environment or of human beings. It can also be implemented in urban areas, as the system can be scaled according to the availability of space. In addition to this, the effluent after going through this system can be used for open irrigation as it meets the World Health Organisation guidelines.
 
 However, a number of additional concerns need further investigation. They include the transmission risk of other types of pathogen, which depends on the source of wastewater, and the effects of hormones and antibiotics on food crops and their effect on human health.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1679/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toxoplasma gondii in Australian Marsupials</field><field name="creator">Parameswaran, Nivethitha (Nevi)</field><field name="description">Diagnostic tools were developed and utilised to detect Toxoplasma gondii infection in a range of Australian marsupial species and identify epidemiological trends. An ELISA was developed to detect anti-T. gondii IgG in macropod marsupials. When compared with the commercially available MAT (modified agglutination test), the ELISA was in high agreement and yielded a &#234; coefficient of 0.96. Of 18 western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) tested for the presence of T. gondii DNA by PCR, the 9 ELISA positive kangaroos tested PCR positive and the 9 ELISA negative kangaroos tested PCR negative indicating that the ELISA protocol was both highly specific and sensitive and correlated 100% with the more labour intensive PCR assay.
 
 A T. gondii seroprevalence study was undertaken on free ranging Australian marsupials. There was a T. gondii seroprevalence of 15.5% (95%CI: 10.7-20.3) in western grey kangaroos located in the Perth metropolitan area. The T. gondii seroprevalence in male western grey kangaroos was significantly less than their female counterparts (p=0.038), which may be related to behavioural differences causing differences in exposure to oocysts or recrudescence of T. gondii infection in pregnant females. Marsupial populations located in islands free from felids had a low overall T. gondii seroprevalence. A case control study determined that marsupials located in areas where felids may roam are 14.20 (95%CI: 1.94-103.66) times more likely to be T. gondii seropositive than marsupials located on felid-free islands.
 
 PCR, immunohistochemistry and serological techniques were used to detect T. gondii infection in marsupial dams and their offspring. T. gondii DNA was detected in the pouch young of chronically infected western grey kangaroos and a woylie (Bettongia penicillata). T. gondii DNA was also identified in the mammary gland of the woylie dam suggesting that infection of the woylie pouch young was from suckling milk from the mammary gland. Results of the study demonstrate that vertical transmission of T. gondii occurs in Australian marsupials and may be of importance in the maintenance of T. gondii infection in Australian marsupial populations.
 
 Animal tissue and meat from Australia, predominately from Australian marsupials, were screened for T. gondii DNA using PCR primers for the multi-copy, T. gondii specific B1 gene. Sequencing of the B1 gene revealed atypical genotypes in 7 out of 13 samples from Australia. These 7 isolates contained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the B1 gene that could not be matched with known sequences from strains I, II, III and X. Six unique genotypes were identified out of the 7 atypical isolates; two out of the 7 isolates had the same unique sequence at the B1 gene whereas the other 5 isolates each had different combinations of SNPs at the B1 gene. A majority of T. gondii isolates sampled from native Australian marsupials were of an atypical genotype. The discovery of atypical strains of T. gondii in Australia leads to further questions regarding the origin and transmission of these atypical strains. Additional studies linking atypical strains with their clinical manifestation are also warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1680/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How Does the Pre-weaning Environment Affect Gut Structure and Function, and Lifetime Performance of the Pig?</field><field name="creator">Payne, Hugh</field><field name="description">The reduction in feed intake and growth rate that occurs following weaning is of major economic consequence to the pig industry.  Currently, a range of antimicrobial products can be used to minimise the impact of weaning on piglet health and subsequent performance.  However, the use of these products in pig diets is subject to increasing restriction worldwide because of perceived risks to public health and to the environment.  Thus, alternative methods are required to mitigate the growth check that almost invariably occurs after weaning in most production systems. 
 Piglets produced outdoors are claimed to experience less of a growth check at weaning and to be able to thrive in relatively unsophisticated weaner accommodation.  However, these claims have not been substantiated under Western Australian conditions, nor a scientific basis for these claims established.  Consequently, a series of experiments was designed to test the general hypothesis for this thesis &#8211; &#8216;the gut structure and function, and lifetime performance of the weaned pig are affected by its pre- and post-weaning rearing environments&#8217;. 
 Experiment 1 was conducted in two parts to quantify differences in the growth performance, health and gut structure of weaner pigs produced indoors or outdoors and reared in conventional or deep-litter pens.  The weaner diet in the first part of the experiment contained 100 ppm of olaquindox and 3,000 ppm of zinc oxide (Exp1a).  This experiment was repeated without using dietary antimicrobial products (Exp1b).  Experiment 2 was conducted in conventional buildings to examine the effect of exposing piglets in lactation to similar substrates to those available to outdoor piglets used in Exp1a and Exp1b in the absence of other differences in the outdoor production milieu. 
 Pre-weaning environments in Exp1a (indoor production (IP) and outdoor production (OP)) appeared to have little effect on gut structure and overall growth rate but significantly affected carcass composition, whereas post-weaning environments (conventional (C) or deep-litter (DL)) affected both overall growth rate and carcass composition.  Although feed disappearance was similar, OP pigs grew faster than IP pigs in the first 47 d after weaning in Exp1a but not in Exp1b.  Lifetime growth rate (GR), P2 backfat, feed disappearance and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were not significantly affected by the production environment in Exp1a whereas OP pigs grew slower with higher P2 backfat and FCR in Exp1b.  Interestingly, OP pigs had heavier carcass weights and higher dressing percentages than IP pigs in both parts of the experiment.  The effects of post-weaning environment were more consistent as DL pigs grew faster, were fatter, and had higher carcass weights and dressing percentages than C pigs. 
 Villus height and crypt depth of IP and OP pigs were not different at 21 (weaning) or 28 d, but villus height decreased and crypt depth increased in the week after weaning.  Pigs reared in C pens had greater faecal concentrations of volatile fatty acids than pigs in DL, indicating that the latter ingested sufficient straw to alter fermentation characteristics. 
 In Experiment 2, there were no differences in gut structure or pre-weaning and lifetime GR of pigs offered no creep feed (NC), a commercial creep feed (CF) or an &#8216;outdoor&#8217; mix (OM) comprising of 1 part straw, 5 parts sow feed and 25 parts of soil taken from paddocks in which OP pigs used in Exp1a and Exp1b were farrowed.  However, NC pigs grew slower in the week after weaning than the other two treatments.  Backfat and feed disappearance were similar for all treatments but pigs on the OM treatment had higher carcass weights and dressing percentages than pigs on the NC and CF treatments.  Villus height and crypt depth were not different between treatments and, although the piglets were weaned at 28 d, villus height decreased and crypt depth increased in the week after weaning to an extent similar to that experienced by piglets weaned at 21 d in Experiment 1. 
 Although all piglets received intramuscular injections of 200 mg iron (Fe) dextran when 1 to 2 days old, piglets offered the OM during lactation had higher serum iron and blood haemoglobin (Hb) levels than those offered NC or CF.  Furthermore, half the piglets offered NC or CF had Hb levels indicative of chronic Fe deficiency anaemia.  The average parity of sows used in this experiment was 6.3 litters, suggesting that piglets may have been born with low Fe stores, possibly because of low Fe stores in their dams due to sub-optimal mineral nutrition over successive parities. 
 In summary, the findings from these experiments partly supported the general hypothesis for this thesis.  Under the conditions of these experiments, access to outdoor substrates in lactation had little effect on gut structure and lifetime growth rate but increased both carcass weight and dressing percentage, whereas rearing in DL pens increased feed intake, FCR, growth rate, P2 backfat, carcass weight and dressing percentage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1682/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solar PV Electrification Programs in Developing Countries:  Towards an Holistic Approach</field><field name="creator">Urmee, Tania</field><field name="description">Rural renewable electrification programs are increasingly being used as a means of providing the rural poor in developing countries with access to electricity. Those programs have varied significantly in design and implementation, as well as in their degrees of success. The explanations for the lack of success and the non-sustainability of the earliest programs are widely accepted as these tended to be technical demonstration projects that relied totally on funding from donor organisations or governments. These projects ignored or overlooked the vital question of how ongoing operational, maintenance and replacement costs would be met. Many genuine programs, however, also met with limited success and much effort has been invested in attempting to understand the reasons for this lack of success. To increase the rates of success of these programs, best practice guidelines were developed. Despite these efforts, many programs have continued to meet with limited success. These points required better explanations of the reasons for program success and failure, which requires a greater understanding of these programs.
 This thesis looks more closely at solar PV electrification programs being undertaken in the Asia-Pacific region to understand why some programs continue to be more successful than others. It aims to understand the decisions behind the planning and implementation of the programs and the reasons that are being implemented in the way that they are, the selection of program objectives, the actual benefits of the programs the and causes of any factors that contribute to their apparent success or lack of success. This understanding is obtained by undertaking in-depth comprehensive field surveys to obtain the views of all program stakeholders. The outcomes of these field surveys are then used to develop a comprehensive set of success criteria and a set of indicators that can be used to measure the success of rural renewable electrification programs. A roadmap that could be followed by the program planners and implementers to ensure program success is also provided.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1683/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enigmatic Pearls: Authorship and Representation: Competing Cultural Positions in Pilbara Pearl, Nullarbor Pearl and Shoalwater Pearl</field><field name="creator">Rossetti, Sarah Jane</field><field name="description">This work is an inquiry into the creative pathways I have undertaken, as a screenplay author, when formulating a body of work, which interrogates issues of importance to me, as a Caucasian, Australian, multicultural, female author, writing within a fictional feature film script construct.

As a screenplay author, I will demonstrate why I find it hard not to agree with Michel Foucault&#8217;s supposition that: &#8220;it is not enough to repeat the empty affirmation that the author has disappeared&#8221; (Foucault 101). 
 
 The creative component of my thesis is a magic realist feature film script, entitled Shoalwater Pearl, written as a prequel to the two other enclosed film scripts largely written outside of this doctoral thesis, featuring the same lead character, Pearl. Pearl carries the weight of my self-consciousness, and through her, I reveal the creative pathways I simultaneously interrogate as I research theoretical issues of importance to me as a screenplay author. 
 
 Faris could not have more aptly put it, regarding the magic realist aim, which I have adapted to my representation of Pearl, as, &#8220;a disturbing element, a grain of sand in the oyster of [. . .] realism&#8221; (Faris 168). 
 
 The theoretical component of my thesis is interwoven with theories of Authorship and Representation including issues of Identity, Aboriginality, Multiculturalism and Gender to better document how my creative and theoretical pathways intertwine, followed by a short Conclusion, Bibliography and Filmography. The Chapter titles, &#8216;Authorship&#8217; and &#8216;Representation&#8217; are used advisedly, as it could be argued that they are controversial subjects. It will be revealed that none of these terms can be considered as stable or abiding. However, each chapter introduces its title as a methodological and normative term for a category or definition from which the chapter emerges. 
 
 As a result of my interdisciplinary approach, I have posited an original pathway for other screenplay authors, who, whilst remaining mindful of marketplace interests, may also enter into identity politics or study social movements in order to create screenplays representing contentious aspects of cultural change in contemporary Australia, whilst paying homage to their own unresolved issues or unique life narratives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1685/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of Samson Fish Seriola hippos with emphasis on the sportfishery in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Rowland, Andrew Jay</field><field name="description">This thesis had two overriding aims.  The first was to describe the biology of Samson Fish Seriola hippos and therefore extend the knowledge and understanding of the genus Seriola.  The second was to uses these data to develop strategies to better manage the fishery and, if appropriate, develop catch-and-release protocols for the S. hippos sportfishery.  
 
 Trends exhibited by marginal increment analysis in the opaque zones of sectioned S. hippos otoliths, together with an otolith of a recaptured calcein injected fish, demonstrated that these opaque zones represent annual features.  Thus, as with some other members of the genus, the number of opaque zones in sectioned otoliths of S. hippos are appropriate for determining age and growth parameters of this species.  Seriola hippos displayed similar growth trajectories to other members of the genus.  Early growth in S. hippos is rapid with this species reaching minimum legal length for retention (MML) of 600mm TL within the second year of life.  After the first 5 years of life growth rates of each sex differ, with females growing faster and reaching a larger size at age than males.  Thus, by 10, 15 and 20 years of age, the predicted fork lengths (and weights) for females were 1088 (17 kg), 1221 (24 kg) and 1311 mm (30 kg), respectively, compared with 1035 (15 kg), 1124 (19 kg) and 1167 mm (21 kg), respectively for males.  Despite these differences, female and male S. hippos attained similar maximum age, i.e. 29 (1470 mm FL) and 28 years (1280 mm FL), respectively.  The maximum age determined for S. hippos is greater than that recorded for any other Seriola spp.  The largest female and male S. hippos recorded during this study were encountered during the tagging component and had fork lengths of 1600 mm and 1380 mm, respectively.
 
 Seriola hippos has a protracted spawning period, ca four months, which starts in late spring and continues through summer into early autumn during which time many individuals engage in large spawning aggregations on the lower west coast of Australia. The length at which 50 % of the females in the population reached maturity was 831 mm FL (888 mm TL) and approximately 4 years of age, whilst all females over 950 mm FL were mature.  Whilst aggregated for spawning S. hippos ceases feeding, however, during the non-spawning period this species can best be described as an opportunistic carnivore which feeds on a variety of pelagic and demersal prey.
 
 This study has greatly increased our understanding of S. hippos movement on the west and south coasts of Australia and has documented, for the first time, the migratory behaviour of a carangid in these waters.  Many S. hippos individuals undertake long distance migrations to join spawning aggregation sites near Rottnest Island.  Individuals tagged at these aggregation sites where recaptured throughout this species distribution along the south coast of Australia, some after travelling distances of over 2400 km.  Many S. hippos individuals displayed strong temporal and spatial spawning ground fidelity as numerous fish released at the spawning aggregations were recaptured at the exact same spawning site at similar times in subsequent years.  Tagging data suggest that on the completion of spawning S. hippos individuals return to a resident location and remain in that general vicinity over the winter months.  
 
 This study has developed a hypothesis describing larval dispersal associated with the S. hippos spawning behaviour exhibited near Rottnest Island.  It is proposed that variations in the prevailing ocean currents, at this important spawning location throughout the protracted spawning period, leads to high intra and inter-annual variation in larval distribution and survival.  The affect of this variation on the evolution of the spawning and migratory behaviour displayed by S. hippos is discussed.
 
 A recent increase in the popularity of S. hippos as a catch-and-release sportfish has led to concerns by some anglers about post release survival of this species, particularly due to the depth of capture.  Short term mortality of S. hippos capture at the sportfishing sites was assessed by monitoring fish held within an enclosure near the site of capture for up to 31 hours post release.  The total hooking mortality of S. hippos subjected to catch-and-release angling within the Rottnest Island sportfishery is approximately 8%.  Most of this observed mortality is delayed and occurs sometime after release.  Although best handling practises require ongoing development, the current level of mortality associated with this catch-and-release fishery is considered acceptable.  Furthermore, this mortality is likely to have little effect on the S. hippos population due to the high abundance of this species and the fact that even the highest fishing effort yields a relatively low catch.  Seriola hippos exhibits a typical teleost neuroendocrine stress response associated with catch-and-release.  The physiological dysfunction associated with the stress of capture in this species does not appear to cause any post release mortality.  Instead, most mortality was attributable to barotrauma, however, although mortality in S. hippos increases with capture depth, this species is much less susceptible to depth induced mortality than other commonly targeted species in which barotrauma has been observed.
 
 This study developed key handling protocols for fishers who catch-and-release S. hippos at the Rottnest Island aggregation sites.  These protocols cover aspects of catch-and-release fishing such as hook type, water depth, time at surface, release method and shark predation.
 
 Almost all S. hippos observed during capture from deep water released large quantities of gas from the opercular region, particularly during the last 10 to 20 m before reaching the surface.  This phenomenon has also been witnessed by divers and fishers to occur under natural conditions.  Investigations into this release of gas revealed this physoclistous species to exhibit unique swim bladder characteristics.  Seriola hippos possess a membranous tube that connects the posterior-dorsal surface of the swim bladder internally to a region under each operculum externally.  This connection, termed the swim bladder vent, allows the escape of expanding swim bladder gases on rapid ascent.  The presence of the swim bladder vent provides an explanation as to why the incidence of external barotrauma symptoms in S. hippos captured from the deepwater was low.  The ability to expel excess swim bladder gases during rapid ascent whilst retaining full swim bladder function is likely to offer this semi-pelagic species considerable advantages when hunting prey, avoiding predators and engaging in spawning activities.
 
 Preliminary estimates of total mortality indicated that S. hippos is not currently subjected to a high level of fishing pressure.  However, managers must remain mindful of the fact that the size at which females reach sexual maturity, i.e. 888 mm TL, is greater than the current minimum legal length, i.e. 600 mm, and thus fishers are currently allowed to harvest sexually immature fish.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of future conservation measures must consider the large scale migration and spawning strategy undertaken by this species in order to ensure its protection.  
 
 The collaborative research approach undertaken during this study demonstrated that a high level of community engagement produced a large amount of research interest, increased stakeholder satisfaction from project input, improved understanding of research outcomes, and increased research uptake, all of which has led to increased stewardship and conservation of the S. hippos fishery and fisheries resources in general.  Indeed, projects of this nature would not be possible without this type of approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1686/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strong and smart: reinforcing aboriginal perceptions of being aboriginal at Cherbourg state school</field><field name="creator">Sarra, Chris</field><field name="description">Abstract not available</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1687/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Be(com)ing reel independent woman: an autoethnographic journey through female subjectivity and agency in contemporary cinema with particular reference to independent scriptwriting practice</field><field name="creator">Sexton-Finck, Larissa Claire</field><field name="description">Women exert only a modicum of production power in 21st century cinema despite its growing accessibility and spectatorship through the developing technologies of the digital era. In 2007, of the top 250 grossing films in Hollywood, only 10% were written, and 6% directed, by women, and just 16% contained leading female protagonists. Why, after the gains of the film feminist movement, is there such a significant gender imbalance in mainstream film, and an imbalance that is only increasing over time? More significantly, what are the possibilities and limitations for reel woman&#8217;s subjectivity and agency, in and on screen, in this male-dominated landscape?
 
 As a female filmmaker in this current climate I conduct an autoethnographical scriptwriting-based investigation into female subjectivity and agency, by writing the feature length screenplay Float, which is both the dramatic experiment and the creative outcome of this research. The exegesis works symbiotically with my scriptwriting journey by outlining the broader contexts surrounding women filmmakers and their female representations.
 
 In this self-reflexive examination, I use an interdisciplinary methodology to unravel the overt and latent sites of resistance for reel woman today on three interdependent levels. These comprise the historical, political and philosophical background to woman&#8217;s treatment both behind, and in front of, the camera; my lived experiences as an emerging writer/director as I write Float; and my representation of the screenplay&#8217;s central female character.
 
 I use the multiple logic of screenplay diegesis to explore the issues that have a bearing on women&#8217;s ability to be active agents in the world they inhabit, including: the dichotomising of female desire, the influence of familial history, the repression of the mother, the dominance of the male gaze, the disavowal of female specificity, and women&#8217;s consequent dislocation from their self-determined desire. These obstacles are simultaneously negotiated as I map my process of writing Float and deal with the challenging contexts in which the screenplay was created. In the course of my scriptwriting investigation, film feminist and French poststructuralist paradigms are considered and negotiated as I experiment whether it is possible for female filmmakers, and their female characters, to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds facing women&#8217;s actualisation today.
 
 My research brings to light the critical need for more inclusive modes of practice across the film industry, discourse and pedagogy that are cognisant and respectful of reel women&#8217;s difference, and allow them to explore their own specificity. The thesis argues that it would be advantageous for female filmmakers to challenge their &#8216;fixed&#8217; status in phallocentric discourse, and to deconstruct their patriarchal conditioning through engagement with forms of identity and writing resistance that recognise the fluidity of their subjectivity, and the consequent potential for change. I also highlight the importance of an accessible and affirmative feminist cinema pertinent to the 21st century, to integrate feminist ideals into the mainstream, and finally bring reel woman out of the margins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1688/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of DNA vaccines in chickens against a wild bird H6N2 avian influenza virus from Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Shan, Songhua</field><field name="description">Genetic immunization, also known as DNA or polynucleotide immunisation, is well documented to induce broad-based immunity in various animal models of infectious and non-infectious diseases. However, the low potency of DNA vaccines has to date precluded the development of commercial vaccines. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate a number of parameters to improve the potency of DNA vaccines for use in chickens, using a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus as a proof-of-concept for their ability to produce a humoral immune response. 
     
 The index virus used in the study was avian influenza virus A/coot/WA/2727/79 (H6N2), isolated from an apparently healthy Eurasian coot in 1979.  Prior to any DNA experiments the virus was rigorously characterized. The virus strain was shown to be an H6 subtype by haemaglutination inhibition (HI) testing and as an N2 subtype by gene sequence analysis. The isolate was shown to be able to grow on MDCK cells in the absence of exogenous trypsin. It was further biologically characterized as LPAI with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 0.15 and a motif of 321PQAETRG328 at the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein. It was capable of infecting domestic chickens under experimental conditions with a low level of virus excretion via the cloaca and oropharynx following intravenous or oral and oculonasal inoculation.
 The full-length HA and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of this H6N2 virus were subsequently cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector VR1012 to generate VR-HA and VR-NP constructs. Six-week-old Hy-Line chickens were intramuscularly injected with either the VR-HA or VR-NP vaccine at different dose rates, with or without lipofectin as adjuvant. Minimal or no detectable antibody was produced, as measured by HI, ELISA and Western blotting-based assay, but high titres of H6-specific HI antibodies appeared 10 days after homologous virus challenge. In contrast to the empty vector controls, there was a significant difference in HI antibody titre between pre- and post-challenge in vaccinated birds, indicating some evidence for the priming effect of the DNA vaccines. Using the frequency of virus shedding as an indicator of protection, lower doses (50 or 100 &#166;&#204;g per chicken) of either adjuvanted VR-HA or VR-NP vaccine significantly reduced virus shedding in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs compared to higher doses (300 or 500 &#166;&#204;g per chicken ) or empty vector control chickens. Although two vaccinations with naked VR-HA alone were not sufficient to induce an effective immune response against a homologous virus challenge, further repeat vaccinations and incorporation of adjuvant did lead to the generation of low to moderate HI antibody titres in some chickens and resulted in no or reduced virus shedding after challenge.
 Next, to examine the effect of expression vector, three different DNA vectors, pCI, pCI-neo and pVAX1 were used to clone the same HA gene and generate three DNA vaccine constructs. Once again, direct intramuscular injection of the three DNA constructs did not elicit measurable H6-specific HA antibody response in Hy-Line chickens but the 100 &#181;g pCI-HA lipofectin adjuvanted vaccine group showed a significant increase in post-challenge HI titres from the naive control group, indicating that an anamnestic antibody response had been induced by the pCI-HA DNA vaccination. Compared with the controls, the three DNA constructs showed significantly reduced virus shedding in cloacal swabs post virus challenge, suggesting that the three DNA vaccines induced some level of immune response in vaccinated chickens. As with the VR-HA construct, the lower dose groups for each vaccine (50 or 100 &#61549;g) were more effective at reducing virus shedding from the cloaca than the higher dose group (300 &#61549;g).
 
 To further investigate why the DNA vaccines did not elicit a measurable antibody response, the HA gene incorporating a Kozak enhancer sequence was cloned into an alternative expression vector, pCAGGS, to produce the pCAG-HAk construct. Three-week-old SPF chickens were immunized with this construct either by the intramuscular route (IM) or electroporation (EP). H6 HI antibodies  were present in some chickens by 3 weeks after the first IM vaccination and 75% of the chickens vaccinated with 10, 100 or 300 &#181;g pCAG-HAk were antibody positive by 2 weeks after the second IM vaccination. For EP immunization, 87.5% of vaccinated birds seroconverted after the first vaccination and 100% seroconverted after the second vaccination and the H6 HI antibody titres were significantly higher than for chickens vaccinated by IM inoculation. Another group was given a single dose IM vaccination with 100 &#181;g of the pCAG-HAk construct and showed a maximum sero-conversion rate of 53.3% with a peak H6 HI titre of 27 at 5 weeks post-vaccination. This demonstrated that optimization of the expression vector and insertion of a Kozak sequence could synergistically enhance expression of the H6 HA gene and result in a measurable H6 antibody response in SPF chickens. EP was also compared with IM inoculation with the 100 &#61549;g pCI-HA construct in SPF chickens, resulting in a 50% sero-conversion rate and mean HI titre of 21.3 at 2 weeks after the second vaccination by EP. By comparison, only 25% chickens had trace HI titres by IM inoculation. This indicated that EP was more efficient than IM delivery for both constructs.
 
 A codon-optimized complete HA gene from A/coot/WA/2727/79 (H6N2) was then chemically synthesized and cloned into a pCAGGS vector to generate the pCAG-optiHAk construct. SPF chickens immunized twice with either 10 &#181;g or 100 &#181;g of pCAG-optHA showed 37.5% and 87.5% sero-conversion rates respectively, with a mean H6 HI tire of 21.4 and 22.6 at 3 weeks after the second immunization, but the differences were not statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in either the sero-conversion rate or the H6 HI titre between the pCAG-HAk and pCAG-optiHAk groups, suggesting that a codon-optimized HA DNA vaccine did not achieve significantly better immunogenicity than the pCAG-HAk vaccine.
 
 In vitro expression of the developed DNA constructs in chicken-, hamster-, monkey- and human-origin cells, as measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence testing (IFT), showed the strength of H6 HA expression in the following descending order - pCAG-optiHAk/pCAG-HAk, pCI-HAk, VR-HA, pCI-HA, pCIneo-HA and pVAX-HA. The in vivo chicken vaccinations also showed that the pCI-HA construct was more effective than the pCI-neo-HA, and that the pCAG-optiHA or pCAG-HAk constructs were better than pCI-HAk in term of reduction in virus shedding after H6N2 virus challenge.  Thus, in vitro HA gene expression directly correlated with the generation of immune responses in vivo, indicating that in vitro studies can be used for pre-selection of expression plasmids prior to development of avian influenza DNA vaccines.
 
 Lipofectin as a chemical adjuvant was shown to enhance the DNA-induced immune response but is prohibitively expensive for routine use in poultry vaccines. Thus, an experimental adjuvant for poultry DNA vaccines (Essai) and a new nanoparticle (Phema) adjuvant used for the first time in poultry were compared with conventional aluminum salts (alum) adjuvant in the present study. No HI antibody was detected in any adjuvant-vaccinated Hy-Line chickens following two immunizations. However, in comparison with the naive control group, the alum- and Phema adjuvanted pCAG-HAk groups significantly reduced the frequency of virus shedding in oropharyngeal swabs, but Essai adjuvant was not effective in augmenting the pCAG-HAk vaccine efficacy. This pilot study also emphasised that the traditional aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, either DNA binding or non-binding, may be useful as an adjuvant for enhancing DNA-induced immune responses in chickens owing to its low price and safety record.
 
 Overall, DNA immunization with various HA-expressing constructs was shown to be variably effective in inducing immune responses in chickens. The efficacy of DNA vaccines could be synergistically improved by taking appropriate approaches. With continuing research DNA vaccines have the potential to become an important tool for disease prevention and control.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1689/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil and Landscape Factors Affecting Phosphorus Loss from the Fitzgerald River Catchment in South West of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Rajesh</field><field name="description">Following over 100 years of agriculture and continuous phosphorus (P) fertilizer application in the south west of Western Australia, there is a growing risk of P transport from cropping and pasture land to streams. However, soil and landscape factors affecting the likelihood of P losses and of stream water contamination have not yet been assessed for the South coast region of Western Australia. The present investigation was conducted in the Fitzgerald River catchment located ~ 400 km south east of Perth, to identify risk of P losses from agricultural land to streams, through an understanding of how P is retained within complex landscapes and released via surface and subsurface flow paths. The 104,000 ha catchment is in a moderately dissected landscape (average annual rainfall 450 mm) and discharges into the World Heritage listed Fitzgerald Biosphere. The main use of cleared land in the catchment is broad-scale agriculture, primarily winter grain cropping and pasture for livestock.
 
 The aim of an initial study was to identify the areas with high soil P concentrations and their relationship to factors such as soil type, topography, management (e.g. fertilizer and manure inputs, and uptake by crops or forage) and how variations in soil P concentrations were related to soil physico-chemical properties, P fertilizer management and landscape position. A wide variation in P concentrations was observed across the catchment, but few of the samples exceeded Colwell extractable P levels of 30 mg/kg in the 0-10 cm layer which is regarded as a critical level for crop and pasture productivity. The western area of the catchment, which was cleared earlier (before 1966) than the eastern area had a greater prevalence of loam soils, and higher Colwell-extractable P concentrations (average)22 mg/kg vs. 13 mg P/kg) due to soil type effects and higher P accumulation over time. Risk of P loss from the east and west of the catchment is expected to vary due to textural and topographic differences and P history (P fertilizer input and uptake by crops). The CaCl2-extractable P in the catchment was negatively correlated with oxalate extractable Fe (Feox) in soils. This suggests that P may be transported as particulate P (PP) on loam and clay soils due to sorption of P on oxides surfaces, while on sand soil leaching losses may be more likely. On loam and clay soils, higher sodicity and the dispersive nature of subsoils may increase the risk of both dissolved P (DP) and PP loss due to the effects on hydraulic conductivity of the profile.
 
 Hedley's fractionation scheme was used to quantify P fractions in the order of decreasing lability, viz: resin-P &gt; NaOH-Pi &gt; NaOH-Po &gt; acid-P (H2SO4-P) &gt; residual-P. Surface soil had higher resin and NaOH-Pi, which are regarded as water-soluble and readily exchangeable P forms, respectively and expected to contribute to DP in the runoff losses. The residual P was the largest fraction followed by the hydroxide extractable organic-P fraction (NaOH-Po): the former was positively correlated (r) with clay content, organic carbon (OC) and pyrophosphate extractable Fe and Al (0.48**, 0.61**, 0.69** and 0.58**, P &lt; 0.01). A relatively higher value of NaOH-Po in the subsurface layer and positive correlation with OC (r = 0.45**, P &lt; 0.01) suggests potential mobility of P as soluble organic P in run-off, throughflow and leachate.
 
 Phosphorus sorption and its relationship to soil properties was used to assess the potential P release from the catchment soils. Values of P sorption maxima varied from 1111-3333 mg/kg for surface soils and 1010-2917 mg/kg for subsoils. The P sorption isotherms conformed better to the Freundlich equation than the Langmuir equation. A highly significant negative correlation between CaCl2 extractable P and Feox in surface soils (r = -0.65**, P &lt; 0.01) suggests that P was bound to hydrated Fe oxide surfaces and this may determine the concentration and dynamics of loosely bound P equilibrating with leachates and eroded particulate materials. On the other hand, high surface organic matter and the high proportion of total dissolved P in organically bound form may inhibit P sorption on clays and sesquioxides, which would increase P mobility through leaching or runoff losses.
 
 The relationship between soil P concentration and degree of P stratification in the top 0-10 cm of soils along five toposequences was examined to predict the effect on runoff P losses. The total Colwell-P content of the 0-10 cm layer of soils in the catchment was very low in comparison to other studies on P losses from agricultural soils, but soils showed higher P concentration at 0-1 cm depth compared to 5-10 cm (average 37 mg/kg vs. 19 mg/kg). The higher extractable P concentration in the 0-1 cm layer will create a greater P mobilization risk in surface runoff and leachate than analysis of the 0-10 cm layer might suggest. Assessment of P risk using the 0-10 cm data would still be reliable as P concentration in the 0-1 cm layer was linearly related (R2 = 0.59) with concentration in the 0-10 cm layer. The sampling at varied soil depths will result in different critical P levels for estimating the risk of P enrichment in runoff.
 
 In a glasshouse study with intact soil columns, initial high P concentrations in leachate decreased with leaching events suggesting that macropore flow dominated in initial leaching events changing later to matrix flow. The hydraulic behavior of clay and loam soil below 10 cm depends largely on structure and the type of clay minerals and exchangeable Na. Higher levels of exchangeable Na in the subsoil might increase dispersion of clay particles resulting in low permeability leading to ponding of surface water or lateral movement of water at the interface of sand A and clay B horizons. Lateral water movements increase the risk of P losses in the form of DP, dissolved organic P (DOP) or PP. The P concentration in all the P forms (DRP, DOP and TDP) increased significantly with P rates of application (P &lt; 0.01). The DRP concentration was &lt; 2 mg/l in unfertilized columns but an increase to 11 mg/l was observed with P application at 40 kg P/ha. The higher proportion of DOP relative to DRP and its correlation with TDP indicates that the DOP was the major form of P in leachate. However, the estimation of DOP which was by subtraction of DRP from TDP generally overestimates OP concentration.
 
 The TDP load from unfertilized soil was &lt; 0.20 mg/l in runoff and &lt; 2.40 mg/l in throughflow but increased with P application (20, 40 kg P/ha) for both packed box and field studies. Under field conditions, higher P loss was found with broadcast P application compared to drill placement. The higher load of DOP as a proportion of TDP and its significant relationship with TDP in runoff (R2sand = 0.81; R2clay = 0.79) and throughflow (R2sand = 0.94; R2clay = 0.98) in field and box studies also suggests DOP was the major form of P loss from soil. Dissolved OP concentration increased significantly with increase in soluble organic carbon (SOC) in soil solution at 5 cm depth (P &lt; 0.05). Consequently, the amount of organic matter dissolved in soil solution may influence P sorption and mobility. Relatively higher affinity of soil for sorption of DRP compared to DOP might allow DOP to be more mobile through the profile. Higher PP load in clay soil in throughflow indicates subsurface lateral flow along the interface with the horizon of dispersive clay might be an additional risk factor regarding P mobility in clay soils of the catchment.
 
 The runoff, throughflow and leachate were dominated by eroded particles of clay and colloidal organic materials. However, the soil solution collected though 0.1 &#61549;m pores in the Rhizon samplers had a similar dominance of DOP to the &lt; 0.45 jum filtered samples in runoff and throughflow. This reduces the likelihood that the so-called DOP fraction was mostly P associated with PP in the 0.1 to 0.45 jum size fraction. The composition of DOP in soil solution collected through Rhizon samplers (&lt; 0.1 jum) might provide important insights for P mobility since this more effectively excluded PP than in the &lt; 0.45 jum filtrate used for runoff and throughflow samples. The DOP in soil solution (&lt; 0.1 jum) might be associated with fine colloidal compound such as silicates, metallic hydroxides, humic acids, polysaccharides, fulvic acids and proteins. If so, then most, but not all of the DOP fraction would be organically bound. However, this requires verification.
 
 In conclusion, soil P levels across the catchment were never very high when assessed in the 0-10 cm layer, but levels in the 0-1 cm layer were more than twice as high. Overall, &lt; 1 % of land area of the upper Fitzgerald River catchment had Colwell-P levels &gt; 30 mg/kg (0-10 cm) and hydrological connection to streams. In addition, another 7 % of land had Colwell-P levels &gt; 15 mg/kg, which appears to be a change point in soils for the release of CaCl2 extractable P. These areas, which are predicted to represent critical source areas of the catchment, need careful management. The high proportions of TDP as DOP in runoff, throughflow and soil solution suggest DOP was the major form of P loss from soil. Phosphorus losses from the catchments are also likely in the form of PP in clay and loam soil but leaching losses are more likely in sand. High exchangeable Na in the subsoil of loam and clay soils increases dispersion of clay particles resulting in low permeability of subsoil and greater lateral P mobility as throughflow at the interface of sand and clay textured horizons.
 
 In general, soils of Fitzgerald River catchment had low soil P, but nevertheless significant risk of P loss at Colwell-P &gt; 15 mg/kg. This study provides baseline information for P loss risks in the wheatbelt of WA. Stream water quality monitoring instruments were installed in the upper Fitzgerald River Catchment at 5 stream locations by CSIRO to measure base line concentrations of P. The measured P concentrations were higher than ANZECC trigger values (&gt; 0.05 mg P/l) for management response over the three-year monitoring period (2005-07). Hence this and many other catchments on the south coast and wheatbelt of south west Western Australia need assessment for P loss risks. Previous emphasis in south west Western Australia on P losses from sandy coastal soils under pasture may need to be reconsidered. In the South coast region, cropping land in the medium rainfall zone may still represent a risk of P loss to waterways and risk to water quality. The present study evaluated the risk of P loss based on soil P forms and their mobility.

This world view, founded on Western historical materialism and a normative perspective, rationalizes &#8220;the project&#8221; as the predominate form of development assistance and the &#8220;expert&#8221; or &#8220;volunteer&#8221; as its agent. Yet this approach to development, although at times successful, has often proved to be unsustainable in the absence of international financing and expertise.
 
 Still, there is an alternative approach available when one recognizes that what the vast majority of people want is security for themselves, their families, and their lifestyles.1 From this approach, the focus of development is shifted away from what people do not have (be it material comforts, infrastructure, or good governance) and sets it on the critical roles culture, individual growth, and informal association have in community development. In this approach, human agency at the interpersonal level becomes critical in the diffusion of social, political, economic, and technological innovation and, accordingly, the decisive factor in poverty reduction. That is to say, development that can address poverty must come from within the social classes that experience it.
 
 To explore how the international development community can act on this alternative approach, this thesis provides a review of the theory, practice, and consequences of international development to the present day and, from that lead, builds a theoretical argument for the individual creative sojourner as a primary messenger of development. In addition, it presents an exploratory case study of creative sojourners in Timor-Leste and, from their ideas and insights, proposes policy considerations for an overseas apprenticeship program that would support the efforts of trades people, agriculturalists, and small entrepreneurs in improving their lives and, in the process, renewing their societies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1691/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Chinese Civilizing Process: Eliasian Thought as an Effective Analytical Tool for the Chinese Cultural Context</field><field name="creator">Stebbins, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis is an effort to apply Elias&#8217;s thinking on social development to the Chinese social situation. At first glance his account of the civilizing process would appear incompatible with this context, in that, after state formation with the Qin and Han dynasties beginning in 221 BC, Chinese civilization remained both stable and highly traditional for well over two millennia. It is argued, however, that closer scrutiny reveals a process that was merely interrupted for a considerable period. The traditional system relied upon a symbiotic relationship between local society and the centre whereby the centre remained relatively small and aloof, not interfering with local social relations, as long as local society provided the required taxes and labour. In this situation the state had the monopolies of both violence and taxation that Elias would look for, but left local society to its own devices primarily because it was already pacified. This self-reinforcing system was enshrined and codified in the Confucian cannon over the course of centuries from the Han dynasty.
 
 Central control of the distribution of resources was eventually required to re-start the Chinese civilizing process, for this was the mechanism through which the local social structure would finally be altered.  This only happened within the past century as the Chinese people struggled to grapple with their own &#8216;backwardness&#8217; in the face of incessant Western and Japanese incursions. At this point the old system was toppled and replaced by progressively more aggressive central governments who saw as their most important task the destruction of the traditional social order in the interest of modernization. As the Chinese state consciously and forcibly took control of the distribution of resources at all levels of society, traditional social relations were stretched and warped, and the Chinese civilizing process re-commenced its long-stalled march toward modernization. This has been evidenced both by the dramatic growth in mobility and the rapidly extending chains of interdependence in the form of guanxi connections primarily during the Post-Opening period after 1978.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1692/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health and disease status of Australia's most critically endangered mammal the Gilbert's potoroo(Potorous gilbertii)</field><field name="creator">Vaughan, Rebecca</field><field name="description">The Gilbert&#8217;s potoroo (Potorous gilbertii) is a small marsupial endemic to the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve in the south-west of Western Australia.  The Gilbert&#8217;s potoroo is classified as Australia&#8217;s most critically endangered mammal (IUCN 2006) with an estimated population of only 35 individuals.  This thesis examines the health and disease status of the Gilbert&#8217;s potoroo, presenting a strong case for the relatively new concept of disease as a potential threatening factor and modifier of population decline.  
 
 Specific diseases, including Cryptococcus, ectoparasitism, endoparasitism, haemoparasitism, Toxoplasma and a novel Treponema organism are extensively studied.  An assessment of the clinical significance of these diseases is made, and management strategies are recommended to minimise the impact of these diseases on both the wild and captive population.
 
 The novel Treponema organism which clinically presents with tenacious, green discharge and an associated balanoposthitis in males is molecularly characterized.  Epidemiological studies show the effects of this agent on reproductive function and a penicillin-based treatment regime is trialled in the analogous long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) with a recommendation to then trial this treatment regime in the critically endangered Gilbert&#8217;s potoroo.
 
 Standard haematological and urinalysis findings are tabulated to form reference ranges for this species.  A treatment regime for Cryptococcus in the analogous long-nosed potoroo is reported and parasitological findings, including the identification of a novel tick species are discussed.
 
 This thesis addresses key health issues, which have subsequently been incorporated into the Recovery Plan of the Gilbert&#8217;s potoroo. A document encompassing multiple disciplines and expertise to support the recovery of this critically endangered marsupial in its current environment.  In addition, this thesis outlines a recommended health monitoring and treatment protocol for future translocation procedures and provides a working example of the emerging importance of health monitoring in threatened species recovery programs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1693/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk and Hierarchy Within International Society: Liberal Interventionism in the Post-Cold War Era</field><field name="creator">Clapton, William</field><field name="description">Several recent works have emphasised contemporary hierarchical trends within international society. These trends have been most readily demonstrated by the willingness of dominant states, such as the United States, to conduct interventions in support of the promotion of liberal values and political institutions. Yet while many scholars have identified new relations of hierarchy within international society, few have explored what they suggest regarding international society&#8217;s normative constitution or what factors have given rise to these new hierarchies. The end of colonialism in the 1960&#8217;s resulted in a fundamental reconstitution of international society. The result of decolonisation was that pluralism, the notion that all states have the equal freedom to constitute their internal socio-political and economic institutions as they see fit, was entrenched as the central constitutive principle of the post-colonial international society.
 
 Contemporary hierarchical trends suggest a transition away from this pluralist constitution, with resultant changes in the processes of inclusion and exclusion and modes of interaction between different members of international society. This thesis aims to explore these processes of reconstitution within international society in the post-Cold War era and explain why Western societies have felt compelled to intervene in particular territories in order to promote liberal values. Utilising sociological theories of risk, particularly the work of Ulrich Beck, this thesis suggests that a new &#8216;liberal social logic of risk&#8217; underpins the emergence of new forms of hierarchy and contemporary constitutional transition within international society. New forms of temporally and spatially de-bounded security risks (such as terrorism), and Western attempts at managing these risks through intervention and the imposition of liberal values in so-called &#8216;risky zones&#8217;, has altered the constitution of international society in a way that gives rise to various hierarchical and anti-pluralist trends.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1694/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Righteousness in the Concept of Covenantal Nomism:  An Exegetical Study of the Psalms of Solomon and Paul's Letters</field><field name="creator">Laloh, Irina</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of E. P. Sanders&#8217; concept of Covenantal Nomism as a description of the &#8220;pattern of religion&#8221; of Judaism.   It has a particular focus on his argument that the religion of first-century Palestinian Judaism was not legalistic.  This thesis seeks to show that his argument is evidently correct by taking the Psalms of Solomon as a case study to test whether its pattern of religion is rightly described as Covenantal Nomism.   It offers a comparative analysis of the Psalms of Solomon and Pauline theology, focusing on the understanding of the &#8216;getting in&#8217; and &#8216;staying in&#8217; stages of their soteriologies.  These are analysed using the concepts of &#8216;monergism&#8217; and &#8216;synergism.&#8217;
 
 The thesis proceeds to examine their theology of &#228;&#233;&#234;&#225;&#233;&#239;&#243;&#253;&#237;&#231; and &#228;&#233;&#234;&#225;&#233;&#239;&#243;&#253;&#237;&#231; &#232;&#229;&#239;&#245;&#770;; in association with the concept of Covenantal Nomism.  The results of this examination are three main findings, which are as follows.  Firstly, the &#8216;getting in&#8217; stage of the Psalms of Solomon is monergistic because God&#8217;s gracious election alone is involved, while the &#8216;getting in&#8217; stage of Paul&#8217;s soteriology is synergistic because faith in Christ Jesus is needed as a response to God&#8217;s justifying activity.  Secondly, in the &#8216;staying in&#8217; stage, the soteriologies of both the Psalms of Solomon and Paul are synergistic, since obedience to the Law or &#8216;obedience of faith&#8217; is required to maintain the covenant relationship with God.  Thirdly, both the Psalms of Solomon and Paul&#8217;s letters show a similar view, which is that God&#8217;s discipline is fundamental to helping the righteous grow in their dependence on Him and rescuing those who sin from destruction.  Both agree that God on the Day of Judgment will reward the righteous who obey, and punish the sinners and the righteous who disobey and choose not to repent.  
 
 The author concludes, from the findings, that contemporary Christians must take care to continue in the obedience of faith and the renewal of their minds through the empowering of the Spirit in order to ensure their continual growth into Christ&#8217;s likeness and to avoid punishment on the Day of Judgment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1697/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporations and the Discourse of Sustainability</field><field name="creator">Gollagher, Margaret</field><field name="description">The contemporary notion of sustainability is emerging as a political response to ecological and social problems associated with human development.  It is a contested concept - eco-modernists interpret it as a call to rethink or adjust industrial production systems while others interpret it as a fundamental challenge to the dominant development paradigm.  
 
 Corporations are playing a key role in shaping the discourse.  Many argue that since corporations have enormous influence in the global political economy, they must take the lead in the search for sustainability.  The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) promotes eco-efficiency - an eco-modernist stance - as the primary business contribution to sustainability.  However, the potential of the corporate focus on efficiency to contribute to sustainability is a subject of debate.  
 
 In this thesis, I use a heterogeneous methodological approach to explore the interaction between corporations (with a focus on multinational corporations) and the discourse of sustainability in order to identify the potential for positive outcomes.  I consider the compatibility of aspects of corporate identity and organisational structure to the ethos of sustainability.  This leads to an examination of the meeting between corporations and sustainability as a reflexive process, paying particular attention to the ways in which language and mythology serve to uphold or transform existing power relations.  I also explore forms of knowledge relevant to sustainability, comparing those that are typically emphasized in corporate enterprise with traditional, Indigenous and local ways of knowing that are essential to sustainability.  The knowledge of classical equestrianism is used as an example in this analysis.  Practical ways of including all these essential perspectives in the discourse are considered.
 
 The thesis concludes that certain aspects of corporate identity, structure and function are incompatible with the ideals of sustainability and that these disparities must be borne in mind as corporations attempt to embrace sustainability.  I contend that sustainability requires network approaches that integrate strong and weak relations as well as diverse values and forms of knowledge.  Sustainability can only be achieved with broad civic engagement that allows the synergistic combination of all values and knowledges relevant to sustainability.  Furthermore, I argue that while corporations&#8217; orientation towards market-based strategies has significant potential to support sustainability, it is limited since the market is fundamentally constituted by a network of weak ties.  Therefore the thesis argues that while corporations can provide significant benefits in terms of sustainability, they cannot be expected to lead the sustainability agenda as it requires discursive plurality.  The efficacy of the corporate contribution to sustainability will be greatly enhanced if companies are guided by strong democratic processes of deliberation and community engagement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1696/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Symbiotic Interactions of Geographically Diverse Annual and Perennial Trifolium spp. with Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii</field><field name="creator">Yates, Ronald</field><field name="description">Perennial clovers are being evaluated for their potential to reduce groundwater levels in Australian cropping zones where many soils are considered too acidic for reliable lucerne nodulation. However, the release of effective inocula for perennial clovers into such areas where sub clover is the predominant legume, could potentially compromise nitrogen fixation from this valuable annual clover if the symbiosis between the new inoculants and sub clover is not optimal. Studies were therefore designed to increase our understanding of these symbiotic interactions to optimise the management of legume-rhizobia interactions to extend (rather than restrict) the use of legumes in new environments.
 
 To assist the understanding of interactions between clovers and their microsymbionts, a glasshouse-based study of the cross-inoculation characteristics of 38 strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii (R. l. trifolii) associated with 38 genotypes of annual and perennial Trifolium spp. from world centres of diversity was undertaken. Rhizobial isolates and clovers were assembled from South and equatorial Africa, North and South America and the Euro-Mediterranean regions. There was substantial specificity amongst the African clovers for effective nodulation. No strain of rhizobia from the South American perennial T. polymorphum, or from the Ethiopian clovers, was able to nodulate sub clover effectively, whilst less than 33% of the 18 strains from these regions could form nodules with the less promiscuous Mediterranean annual T. glanduliferum. Seventy of 476 cross-inoculation treatments examined did not nodulate, whilst 81 treatments clearly demonstrated effective nodulation. The remainder of the crossinoculation pairings revealed only partially effective or ineffective nodulation. Two barriers to effective nodulation were identified from the cross- inoculation study: a geographic barrier representing the broad centres of clover diversity, across which few host- strain combinations were effective; and within each region, a significant barrier to effective nodulation between an isolate from an annual host on a perennial host, or vice versa. Clovers and their rhizobia from within the Euro-Mediterranean region of diversity were more able to overlap the annual/perennial barrier than genotypes from the other regions. The data indicate that it will be a substantial challenge to develop inocula for perennial clovers that do not adversely affect nitrogen fixation by sub clover and other annual clovers in commerce, especially if the perennial clovers originate from Africa or America.
 
 To investigate the management of legume-rhizobia interactions when introducing legumes into new environments, a study was initiated in Uruguay (Mediterranean annual clovers were introduced into a predominantly perennial clover setting) that could be considered opposite to the situation emerging within southern Australia (perennial clovers evaluated in a predominantly annual clover setting). The Uruguayan grasslands contain populations of indigenous R. l. trifolii that nodulate endemic T. polymorphum but form ineffective nodules on clovers originating from the Mediterranean region. Importantly in the Uruguayan setting, Government policy has facilitated the introduction of numerous varieties of annual Mediterranean clovers with the aim of improving overall winter production in their naturally managed grasslands. In an attempt to understand the rhizobial ecology of this scenario, a cross-row experiment was set-up in 1999 in a basaltic, acid soil in Glencoe, Uruguay, to follow the survival and symbiotic performance of nine exotic strains of R. l. trifolii. In this thesis I report on the ability of the introduced strains to compete for nodule occupancy of Mediterranean clover hosts and show the impacts of the introduced strains on the productivity of the indigenous Uruguayan clover, T. polymorphum. Of the introduced strains, WSM1325 was a superior inoculant and remained highly persistent and competitive in forming effective symbioses with the Mediterranean hosts, T. purpureum and T. repens, in the Uruguayan environment over a 3 year period. T. purpureum and T. repens, when inoculated with the introduced strains, did not nodulate with any indigenous R. l. trifolii as typed from nodules of T. polymorphum. Conversely, there were no nodules on the Uruguayan host T. polymorphum that contained the introduced R. l. trifolii. These results revealed that there were effective symbioses between strains of R. l. trifolii and clovers, even though the soil contained ineffective R. l. trifolii for all hosts. This represents the first reported example of selective nodulation for an effective symbiosis in situ with annual and perennial clovers in acid soils. This phenomenon raised the question of whether this was restricted to the particular edaphic scenario in Glencoe, Uruguay.
 
 Glasshouse-based experiments in Australia were conducted to further understand the selection phenomenon. Two strains were selected for comparisons; strain WSM1325 isolated from an annual clover in the Mediterranean and WSM2304 isolated from the perennial clover T. polymorphum in Uruguay, South America. Variables that may have been specific to Glencoe were investigated. Thus, the effect of cell density and strain ratio at the time of inoculation, as well as soil pH, were examined on the two hosts (T. purpureum and T. polymorphum). Each was exposed to the same effective and ineffective micro-symbionts. In co-inoculation experiments at a cell density of 104 cells mL-1, each host nodulated solely with its effective strain, even when this strain was out-numbered 100:1 by the ineffective strain. However, the selection process ceased when the effective strain was out-numbered 1000:1. At higher basal cell concentrations of 105 - 108 cells mL-1, selection for WSM1325 to form effective nodules on T. purpureum was evident, but was significantly reduced as the ratio of ineffective cells in the inoculum increased above 4-fold. These results indicate that the selection mechanism is highly dependent upon the basal rhizobial cell density. Soil pH did not significantly alter the process, which could not be simply explained by the rate of strain growth, or extent of nodulation.
 
 Greater precision was sought in the terminology applied to nodulation outcomes where legumes have a choice of micro-symbiotic partners from within the same species of root-nodule bacteria. The nominated preferred terms are &#8220;nonselective&#8221;, &#8220;exclusive&#8221;, and &#8220;selective&#8221; nodulation.
 
 In view of the difference in host range between WSM1325 and WSM2304 and the selective nodulation process, a preliminary investigation into the genetic backgrounds of WSM1325 and WSM2304 was conducted. A selected range of gene regions were amplified by PCR from each strain and sequenced. Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed that although the 16S rRNA sequences were identical, the atpD, GSII and nodD sequences contained distinct differences revealing disparity between the pSym replicons and between the chromosomal replicons of these strains. Of the genes sequenced, the highest degree of divergence was noted for the symbiotic NodD protein products, which are known to be critical determinants in the nodulation of specific hosts. An examination of the nodD gene region of WSM1325 and WSM2304 revealed a further contrasting feature; the regulatory gene nodR was present in the nodD gene region of WSM1325 but absent in WSM2304. Since NodR is known to be required for adding highly unsaturated fatty acyl groups onto the Nod-factor backbone, I could now hypothesise that the nodulation incompatibility observed between Trifolium hosts and micro-symbionts obtained from different geographical locations may result from differences in Nod-factor decoration. With the full genome sequence of the two strains WSM1325 and WSM2304 soon to be available, the role of nodR and any link to the selection phenomenon described in this thesis can be addressed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1699/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The utility of morphological, ITS molecular and combined datasets in estimating the phylogeny of the cortinarioid sequestrate fungi</field><field name="creator">Francis, Anthony</field><field name="description">Molecular technology has shown the classical, morphologically defined groupings of sequestrate cortinarioid fungi to be artificial and in need of revision. However, these same molecular studies have highlighted morphological characters, such as spore shape and ornamentation, that have proved useful for distinguishing phylogenetically informative groups. This observation underpins the hypothesis of this study: that the numeric analysis of selected morphological characters can provide the same picture of the diversity of, and relationships among, sequestrate cortinarioid fungi as that recovered from phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequence data.
 
 Sequestrate fungi are those in which the spores mature inside an enclosed fruit body, remaining there until the fruit body decomposes or is eaten. For the purposes of this thesis the following genera are considered to contain cortinarioid sequestrate fungi: Auritella, Cortinarius, Dermocybe, Descomyces, Hymenogaster, Hysterogaster, Inocybe, Protoglossum, Quadrispora, Setchelliogaster and Timgrovea. This thesis focussed on Australian representatives of these fungi to address the hypothesis outlined above.
 
 Four analysis methods were applied to each of three datasets (morphological, rDNA and combined data) in a comparative approach to test the stated hypothesis. The four analysis methods were two multivariate methods: cluster analysis and ordination (by principal coordinates analysis), and two phylogenetic methods: maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis.
 
 Low bootstrap support and Bayesian partition probabilities for phylogenetic analyses of the morphological data indicated this dataset had little to no phylogenetic signal discernable by parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Different analyses of the morphological data differed in the way they grouped the collections. The type of clustering method used affected the pattern of relationships recovered. The coding of the data had a much more substantial effect on the patterns of relatedness suggested by the multivariate analyses. Despite the low level of phylogenetic information and agreement between analyses of the morphological data it was found that some collections were consistently grouped together. This included the separation of the Cortinarius-like collections from the Descolea-like collections and the relatively consistent grouping of some pairs of collections and some larger groups. Thus, despite the limited phylogenetic signal of the small morphological dataset and the artefacts of coding, some relatively consistent groups were recovered.
 
 Separate analyses of the Cortinarius-, Descolea- and Hebeloma-like ITS sequences recovered similar patterns to published phylogenies. The inclusion of more sequestrate taxa and a greater sample of Australian collections than previous studies, indicated that both Timgrovea subgenera nest among the Descolea-like collections and that hitherto undiscovered lineages of Descolea-like fungi are represented among the collections in Australian herbaria. The Cortinarius-like fungi fall within clades recognised by published phylogenies. Similar topologies were supported by both Parsimony bootstrap and Bayesian partition probability values for analyses of the molecular data including the separation of Cortinarius-like collections from Descolea-like collections. However neither of these methods of analysis and evaluation yielded well-resolved deeper nodes for either of these two major clades. Comparable clades/clusters of Cortinarius- like and Descolea-like collections were found in all analyses of the molecular data. Thus phylogenetically distinct groups of cortinarioid sequestrate fungi could be consistently distinguished using ITS molecular data, but not confidently related to one another.
 
 The ratio of molecular to morphological characters (741:16) meant the patterns observed for the combined analyses were more similar to those observed in analyses of the molecular data than those of the morphological data. This included the recovery of substantially similar clades/clusters to those recovered by analyses of the molecular data alone. The value of combining the morphological and molecular data as analysed is questioned despite the congruence of the datasets according to the Incongruence-Length Difference test. Differences between the molecular and combined datasets arose primarily where the molecular data grouped collections that were also grouped by the morphological data.
 
 The numeric analysis of the selected morphological characters as carried out in this study did not recover the same pattern of groups and relationships among the cortinarioid sequestrate fungi as phylogenetic analyses of ITS data. The composition of groups recovered using the morphological data alone or as part of the combined dataset, and the relationships between those groups, differed from those recovered from the molecular data alone; although there were similarities between groups recovered from different datasets. The ability of this thesis to conclusively address its fundamental hypothesis was compromised by limitations of the study such as taxon sampling, character selection, character coding and the poor resolution of the ITS phylogeny. Acknowledging these limitations, and that some similar groups were recovered, the results of this thesis do not support its stated hypothesis that the numeric analysis of selected morphological characters can provide the same picture of the diversity of, and relationships among, sequestrate cortinarioid fungi as recovered from phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequence data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1700/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Epidemiology and Control of Caseous Lymphadenitis in Australian Sheep Flocks</field><field name="creator">Paton, Michael Wayne</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis was to better understand the epidemiology of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) and its economic effects on the Australian sheep industries. The work also sought to apply this knowledge to better understand how to control the disease in Australian sheep flocks.
 
 The occurrence of CLA in some other species, as a comparison to CLA in sheep, is described in the literature review. However a comprehensive review of research on CLA in all livestock species is not needed to meet the aims of the thesis.
 
 The research used serological tests developed in the 1970s and &#8216;80s to examine the epidemiology and costs of CLA in Western Australian sheep flocks. Epidemiological techniques were used to determine the main risk factors associated with high incidences of CLA. Controlled experimentation was used to better understand the spread of CLA within flocks. Prevalence data collected at abattoirs and survey techniques were employed to better understand how CLA was being controlled in Australian sheep flocks.
 
 It was shown that toxin and cell wall ELISA tests for CLA were useful tools to study the spread of CLA in sheep flocks. Using the serological tests it was estimated that 80 per cent of CLA spread occurs after the second and third shearings. This knowledge was used to design a risk factor study which identified two significant factors associated with high CLA spread, that is in dips and close contact after shearing.
 
 These tests also facilitated the study of new CLA infection on wool production. It was found that sheep produce approximately five per cent less clean wool in the year in which they are infected.
 
 The main routes for the spread of CLA were from sheep with lung abscesses to those with skin cuts and through dips, rather than from an environment contaminated with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis bacteria.
 
 A survey of sheep producers found that the prevalence of CLA had decreased from over 50% in the 1970s to approximately 20% in the late 1990s. It also found that current vaccines were being used inefficiently. Large increases in the efficiency of control can be achieved by approximately 70 per cent of producers by using commercially available vaccines and the recommended vaccination programs of two doses to lambs and annual boosters to adult sheep.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1715/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whitefellas and wadjulas: anti-colonial constructions of the non-aboriginal self</field><field name="creator">Carey, Michelle</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I argue for anti-colonial constructions of the non-Aboriginal self.  I take as my starting point that members of the invader/settler society in Australia must place them/ourselves in &#8220;an embodied awareness of &#8216;being in Indigenous sovereignty&#8217;&#8221; (Nicholl, 2004: 17) and name them/ourselves accordingly.  An anti-colonial construction of non-Aboriginality formed within the locus of Aboriginal Sovereignty undermines the potency of &#8216;post-colonial&#8217; processes of identity formation, which privilege the colonialist centre, and the concomitant marginalised position of Indigenous people.  Thus, an anti-colonial construction of non-Aboriginality constitutes a radical recentring for processes of identity construction within invader/settler societies.
 
 This work responds to critical whiteness studies and post-colonial discourses of &#8216;belonging&#8217;. I acknowledge both whiteness studies and work on invader/settler belongings have gained traction in recent years as a means to problematise the whiteness of the settler/invader group and the legitimacy of their/our belongings.   However, I argue they continue to operate within colonialist paradigms and perpetuate (neo)colonial power relations.  
 
 In this thesis, I argue anti-colonial constructions of non-Aboriginality are constructed in dialogue with Aboriginal people. I conceive non-Aboriginality as a political identity that rejects &#8216;race&#8217; and &#8216;colour&#8217; as markers for identity.  &#8216;Non-Aboriginality&#8217; enables members of invader/settler societies to articulate support for Aboriginal Sovereignty and Aboriginal claims for social justice and human rights.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1757/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the impact of e-privacy risk concerns on citizens' intentions to use e-government services: an Oman perspective</field><field name="creator">Al Abri, Dhiyab</field><field name="description">E-privacy concerns are among the online transactions risks that influence the use of e-services and e-government services. Whilst there have been studies that have analysed the impact of e-privacy on the willingness of people to utilize the Internet, especially in e-commerce, there has been limited research in relation to e-government services for a specific demographic group. This study has examined the impact of e-privacy risk concerns on the acceptance of e-government services in Oman using an integrated model. The model is based on Liu et al.&#8223;s (2005) privacy-trust-behavioral intention model, the broader technology acceptance literature, and recent work on e-privacy awareness and protection. The research used both quantitative and qualitative approaches: data collection by questionnaire and a series of semi-structured interviews. The sampling frame for the study was civil services government employees in Oman. The model was tested using partial least squares and the results were compared to those obtained from the interview data.
 
 The study found that e-privacy awareness significantly impacts the level of e-privacy risk concerns. Social norms and perceived usefulness were found to play a significant role in influencing the intention to use e-government services. The study also found that e-privacy concerns and perceptions of the protection available against risks influence citizens&#8223; intentions to use e-government services via their influence on the perceived trustworthiness of these services. Thus trustworthiness is a factor that could be an obstacle to successful e-government services project implementation. Therefore the thesis recommends that governments pay greater attention to the role of e-privacy concerns and put in place security and e-privacy controls. Citizens should then be made aware of these in order to build the required level of trust and confidence in these services.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1758/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The eyes of death: the visual movement from witness to spectator</field><field name="creator">Dagli, Zeynep</field><field name="description">This doctoral study, composed of four films and an exegesis, configures a new conceptualisation of death in and through film, assembling an intricate theorisation of &#8216;the mediated I&#8217; and &#8216;the unmediated I&#8217; of the witness. This thesis focuses on the consciousness of the witness, through locating a position and expression in reflective, reflexive, experiential, critical and artistic practice. My research questions the witness&#8217;s attempt to &#8216;manage&#8217; the experience and tracks the self reflective process of thought s/he undertakes in the face of death, dying, coma and suffering. In probing the subjective experiences of the witness, the knowledge of disaster and the absent Other gives way to a moment of distinction between the spectator and the witness. The actual movement being proposed between the two is through the ways in which they both are activated through the reality of death. Critical and creative practice encourages a recognition of - and identification with - the possible meditations and negotiations of the witness. It aims to infuse a configuration of the witness by way of reflection in consciousness and artistic formulation.
 
 This thesis proposes a conceptual diagnosis as the original contribution to knowledge. I identify apathy as an anti-choice and unrecognised necessity of consciousness in the face of death, dying, coma and suffering. The research offers a new insight into the existential encounter of the witness. The aim of the practice component is to re-present and re-vision everyday encounters on television and in media alongside metaphors, possible meditations and negotiations to the subjective experience in and through filmic gaze. The visual propositions complement the written text by means of displaying the fear and anguish of the witness, and the attitude towards the Other, disaster and the irrecoverable death. The aim in turning this subject matter into an academic study has been to align two different perceptions: visual and theoretical practice. These two conceptual terms have offered distinct ways of handling the unsettling encounter from not only a witness&#8217;s point of view but also from the perspective of a researcher and the film-maker.
 
 Together, the visual and theoretical strategy reveal the workings of consciousness and creative meditation of the witness to identify the struggles against internal and external terror in being a witness. The research is interdisciplinary, deploying philosophy, literary and artistic theory. Yet it is not a contribution to the specialised discipline of philosophy, sociology or psychoanalysis of death, dying and suffering, but offers a critical and creative matrix combining inventive and reflexive approaches. This practice-based doctoral study challenges the artist and practitioner to create and then raise awareness through a dynamic, reflexive and interpretative discourse. It fuses genres, including autobiography, literary studies and visual arts.
 
 The relationship between the exegesis and films provide an innovative pathway through creative meditation and negotiation of the witness by integrating filmic presentations as an integral loop in the research. Every chapter frames a dialogue between already existing theories of death, dying and grief and filmic texts to transform experience into visuality through constructing a descriptive insight and artistic expression.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1759/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health and 'I': an analysis of curricular phenomena in health professional education through the focus of critical pedagogy</field><field name="creator">Lowe, Wendy Anne</field><field name="description">The education of health professionals is based on a series of discourses of professionalism that privilege notions of control and choice (Riggs, 2004a; Titchen and Higgs, 2001). These discourses are expressed through both explicit and implicit curricula, which encourage the enactment of a particular construction of the 'self' of both health professionals and clients or patients. This thesis adopts a feminist poststructural analysis of relations of power to explore some of the effects of the enactment of these curricula, drawing on three case studies of education in rural health settings and interviews with 17 health workers.
 
 The results indicate that the enactment of these curricula seems to produce a particular sense of self for health workers &#8211; one that is bound up with notions of control and choice, and one that may require struggle on an inner level with the self-regulation and self-policing (O'Grady, 2005) required to fit this norm. The struggle for female health workers to link the abstract theorizing with the actualities of their lives (Williams, 2002) seems to produce a paradoxical type of relationship with themselves and their clients. On one hand there is a discourse of conformity, compliance and obedience, which suggests more of a slippage of self while at the same time the expert-novice relationship characterizing the health professionals&#8223; interaction with clients emphasizes autonomy, control and empowerment of self. Further, while health workers see themselves as having high levels of internal locus of control this is in direct contrast to the helplessness and powerlessness they experience at work, and revealed through the research.
 
 The curriculum reform taking place within all health professional education at the moment emphasizes evidence-based practice and scientific content, and thus reinforces the dominant norm of the neo-liberal individual capable of self-regulation and self-policing. This research suggests the limitations of this approach, given the practices of power that continue to disadvantage women in general and patients in particular in relation to their health and the institution.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1760/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recombinant proteins as vaccines and diagnostic antigens for the control of Jembrana disease virus infection in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Joshua Richard</field><field name="description">embrana disease virus (JDV) is a lentivirus associated with an acute disease syndrome of Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) in Indonesia. Control of Jembrana disease currently involves serological monitoring of infection in endemic areas, restriction of movement of cattle from these areas and ring-vaccination around outbreaks of the disease with a tissue-derived inactivated-virus vaccine.
 Earlier investigations at Murdoch University resulted in a vaccine combining a mix of recombinant capsid (CA) and Tat proteins that ameliorated the clinical signs of JDV infection in vaccinated cattle. This thesis reports the development of an alternative novel fused CA and Tat polyprotein antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund&#8217;s adjuvant (IFA) as a vaccine. This polyprotein could be produced in a single operation at a lower cost than the mix of the 2 individually produced recombinant proteins. The effect of vaccination with this CA and Tat polyprotein vaccine was compared to vaccination with a mixture of individual CA and Tat proteins in small groups of cattle that were subsequently challenged with virulent JDV. It was found that the fused polyprotein vaccine elicited a greater antibody response against both the CA and Tat antigens than a vaccine containing the mix of individual recombinant proteins. In cattle vaccinated with the fused recombinant polyprotein the viral load and lymphocyte response to infection was similar to that in cattle vaccinated with the mix of individual proteins.  When the CA and Tat polyprotein vaccine was administered to cattle under field conditions, the vaccine induced minimal side effects and an antibody response to both CA and Tat proteins that persisted for 12 months.
 A recombinant protein antigen was produced for ELISA and Western immunoblotting assays that enabled serological detection.  This antigen provided an alternative to the whole virus antigen that is currently used in Indonesia for these serological assays. The whole virus antigen is prepared from plasma of JDV-infected cattle using a differential centrifugation technique and is difficult to produce in Indonesia. It was found that a recombinant full length CA (p26) protein antigen used in an ELISA provided sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that obtained by Western immunoblotting with the whole virus antigen. This recombinant CA protein antigen is now used in routine serological assays for detection of JDV in Indonesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1806/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring youth civic development in Malaysia: Conceptualization, instrument development using the Rasch measurement model, and substantive outcomes</field><field name="creator">Tor, Geok Hwa</field><field name="description">This study concerned the development of measures for youth civic development in Malaysia with four major goals in mind, namely conceptual, measurement, baseline/pragmatic, and predictive goals. It was a preliminary study of its kind in Malaysia as Malaysia did not participate in any international or regional study such as the IEA Civic Study. The central intention of the study was to establish a conceptually valid assessment framework and psychometrically sound instruments for the measurement of youth civic development in Malaysia. This would, in turn, provide some baseline information upon which future research on youth civic development in Malaysia could build.
 
 Civics as a subject was removed from the Malaysian school curriculum in the early 1980s and Civic and Citizenship Education as a specific subject, with an explicit structure and curriculum framework, was reintroduced only in 2005. It was not feasible at the time when this study was conducted to conduct a specific assessment on the outcomes for school-aged students as explicated and expected in the curriculum framework. Therefore, the post-school-aged group of young undergraduates in public universities within the age range of 17-28 was selected as the target population.
 
 Firstly, a conceptualisation of youth civic development was synthesized by identifying current views on citizenship, as set out in the international literature and, specifically, in Malaysia in two major documents &#8211; the Rukenagara and Vision2020. Civic development consists of three variables of Civic Knowledge (CK) (knowledge about the legal status and associated rights and responsibilities of citizens); Civic Disposition (CD) (views on identity and attitudes as a citizen); and Civic Engagement (CE) (participation as a citizen). The relationship between civic development variables was explicated through a Neo-Vygotskian cultural-historical theory of human development. In addition, Bronfenbrenner&#8217;s Socio-Ecological Theory of human development was adopted for the selection of contextual and individual factors (the independent variables) for the conceptual model. To help ensure cross-cultural validity for use within the Malaysian socio-cultural context, the three dependent variables of CK, CD and CE, and the independent variables were appraised for their suitability for use within the Malaysian socio-cultural context before they were operationalized into observable indicators.
 
 Secondly, the Rasch measurement paradigm, framework and model were adopted as the foundation for instrument development and validation. The procedures for instrument development followed Wilson&#8217;s model of four building blocks of instrument development (Wilson, 2005). Three instruments were developed for this study, namely The Malaysian Civic Knowledge Inventory (MCKI), The Malaysian Civic Disposition Inventory (MCDI), and the Malaysian Civic Engagement Inventory (MCEI).  Items from existing instruments in international literature were adopted or adapted for the three instruments, especially the MCEI, if there was construct equivalence in Rukunegara and Vision 2020. This was to ensure a cumulative tradition in research on youth civic development. Most of the items in the MCKI and the MCDI however were developed specifically for this study to capture the specificity of the civic culture of Malaysia.
 
 The target population for the study was undergraduate students enrolled in Malaysian public universities. Students at one public university were chosen as the accessible population.  Data were collected in February 2006 (pilot study) and from July to August 2006 (main study). The sample for this study (N=1391) was drawn through multistage cluster sampling by study concentration, level of study, and clusters based on lecture/tutorial group. The sample also, by default, included major inherent characteristics of the target population, particularly gender (Male and Female) and ethnicity (Malay, Chinese, Indian and other ethnic groups).
 
 Rasch analyses confirmed the three-dimensional structure of youth civic development. Three measurement scales with acceptable psychometric properties were established to provide measures for the three dependent variables of CK, CD and CE.  The hypotheses about civic development (in terms of CK, CD and CE) as a &#8216;tool and result&#8217; activity were tested through path analyses of mediational relationships based on Baron and Kenny&#8217;s criteria (1986) using the Rasch-derived linearized scores from the main study. Analyses provided statistical support for a bidirectional association between each pair of CK, CD and CE, despite the low inter-correlations between them.
 
 This study revealed that, on average, youth in this study demonstrated a moderately high level of CK (Mean =1.11, SD = 0.77), a positive CD (Mean = 1.25; SD = 0.63) but a moderately low CE (Mean = -0.44; SD = 0.92).  The Malay sub-sample scored, on average, higher on all three dimensions of civic development. The results of hierarchical multiple regressions however showed the effect of ethnicity (Malay or Non-Malay) was statistically non-significant when other contextual (home, curricular and co-curricular) variables were entered into the regression equation. This indicates it is not ethnicity that predicts levels of civic development, but rather it is the differences in other socio-political entitlements and status associated with ethnic status. Three selected collective social-contextual factors of home, curriculum and co-curriculum explained only a fairly modest but statistically significant amount of variance (10 to 20%) in the dependent variables.
 
 Finally, the findings were discussed in relation to the theoretical perspectives undergirding this study.  Pragmatic implications for policy planning as well as other relevant stakeholders involved in youth civic development are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1810/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"the lonely and the road&#8221; (novel) &#8220;What&#8217;s your road, man?&#8221;: my experiences with the life and work of Jack Kerouac in relation to the development of &#8220;the lonely and the road&#8221; (exegesis)</field><field name="creator">Stubley, John</field><field name="description">Thirty thousand feet above the Pacific Ocean&#8212;somewhere between Sydney and Los Angeles&#8212;the narrator of &#8220;the lonely and the road&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really know where he is going, or why. His is a quest written spontaneously&#8212;&#8216;on-the-go.&#8217; It is a journey of uncertain motivation, of uncertain means, towards uncertain ends. From Los Angeles, to Vegas, to the Rocky Mountain states and beyond, the narrator travels with and learns from his friends, his family and even his ex-girlfriend as he searches for that which continues to elude him. But what is that exactly? Does it even exist?
 
 While the novel details a journey, the exegesis is a phenomenological account of the intersecting of my road with that taken by Jack Kerouac. It explores my experiences with the life and work of Kerouac&#8212;the creator of spontaneous prose&#8212;in relation to the development of my writing, up to and including this novel. In doing so, the exegesis is itself a quest that seeks to understand more fully the essence of Kerouac&#8217;s and my own representation of the quest motif in content and in form. Both the exegesis and the novel, then, constitute part of the search for my own artistic road, and aim to assist others in search of theirs.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/1811/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectual capital reporting in Sri Lanka with a focus on human capital (1998-2000)</field><field name="creator">Abeysekera, Indra</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--Macquarie University, Graduate School of Management, 2004.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporation reports -- Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Financial statements -- Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Intellectual capital -- Sri Lanka -- Accounting</field><field name="subject">Human capital -- Sri Lanka -- Accounting</field><field name="subject">Intellectual capital -- Valuation -- Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Human capital -- Valuation -- Sri Lanka</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/23005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resolving conflict for gutpela sindaun: an analysis and evaluation of traditional and modern methods of achieving peaceful intergroup relations among the Enga of Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Young, Douglas W</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD) -- Macquarie University, School of History, Philosophy, and Politics, Centre for Conflict Resolution, 1995.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enga (New Guinea people)</field><field name="subject">Social conflict -- Papua New Guinea -- Enga Province -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Conflict management -- Papua New Guinea -- Enga Province -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Intergroup relations -- Papua New Guinea -- Research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/23155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women who manage: women's experience as managers in contemporary Australian organisations : implications for the discourse of management and organisation(s)</field><field name="creator">Ross-Smith, Anne</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--Macquarie University, Graduate School of Management, 1999.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women executives -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Sex role in the work environment -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Organizational sociology</field><field name="subject">Women executives -- Australia -- Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/26116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systemic functional interpretation of Thai grammar: an exploration of Thai narrative discourse</field><field name="creator">Patpong, Pattama</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--Macquarie University, Division of Linguistics &amp; Psychology, Department of Linguistics, 2006.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discourse analysis, Narrative</field><field name="subject">Thai language -- Grammar</field><field name="subject">Thai language -- Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Systemic grammar</field><field name="subject">Functionalism (Linguistics)</field><field name="subject">Thai language -- Mood</field><field name="subject">Thai language -- Transitivity</field><field name="subject">Thai language -- Clauses</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/23285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The implementation of the policy of Reconciliation in NSW schools</field><field name="creator">Burridge, Nina</field><field name="description">"November 2003".</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations -- Study and teaching -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islanders -- Government relations -- Study and teaching -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islanders -- Government relations</field><field name="subject">Education and state -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Race relations -- Study and teaching -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/25954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The governance of firms controlled by more than one board: theory, development and examples</field><field name="creator">Turnbull, Shann</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--Macquarie University.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsive Workflows: Design, Execution and Analysis of Interruption Policy Models</field><field name="creator">Belinda Melanie Carter</field><field name="description">Business processes form the backbone of all business operations, and workflow technology has enabled companies to gain significant productivity benefits through the automatic enactment of routine, repetitive processes. Process automation can be achieved by encoding the business rules and procedures into the applications, but capturing the process logic in a graphical workflow model allows the process to be specified, validated and ultimately maintained by business analysts with limited technical knowledge. The process models can also be automatically verified at design-time to detect structural issues such as deadlock and ensure correct data flow during process execution. These benefits have resulted in the success of workflow technology in a variety of industries, although workflows are often criticised for being too rigid, particularly in light of their recent deployment in collaborative applications such as e-business. Generally, many events can impact on the execution of a workflow process. Initially, the workflow is triggered by an external event (for example, receipt of an order). Participants then interact with the workflow system through the worklist as they perform constituent tasks of the workflow, driving the progression of each process instance through the model until its completion. For traditional workflow processes, this functionality was sufficient. However, new generation 'responsive' workflow technology must facilitate interaction with the external environment during workflow execution. For example, during the execution of an 'order to cash' process, the customer may attempt to cancel the order or update the shipping address. We call these events 'interruptions'. The potential occurrence of interruptions can be anticipated but, unlike the other workflow events, they are never required to occur in order to successfully execute any process instance. Interruptions can also occur at any stage during process execution, and may therefore be considered as 'expected, asynchronous exceptions' during the execution of workflow processes. Every interruption must be handled, and the desired reaction often depends on the situation. For example, an address update may not be permitted after a certain point, where this point depends on the customer type, and a shipping charge or refund may be applicable, depending on the original and new delivery region. Therefore, a set of rules is associated with each interruption, such that if a condition is satisfied when the event occurs, a particular action is to be performed. This set of rules forms a policy to handle each interruption. Several workflow systems do facilitate the automatic enforcement of 'exception handling' rules and support the reuse of code fragments to enable the limited specification and maintenance of rules by non-technical users. However, this functionality is not represented in a formal, intuitive model. Moreover, we argue that inadequate consideration is given to the verification of the rules, with insufficient support provided for the detection of issues at design-time that could hinder effective maintenance of the process logic or interfere with the interruption handling functionality at run-time. This thesis presents a framework to capture, analyse and enforce interruption process logic for highly responsive processes without compromising the benefits of workflow technology. We address these issues in two stages. In the first stage, we consider that the reaction to an interruption event is dependent on three factors: the progress of the process instance with respect to the workflow model, the values of the associated case data variables at the time at which the event occurs, and the data embedded in the event. In the second stage, we consider that the reaction to each interruption event may also depend on the other events that have also been detected, that is, we allow interruptions to be defined through event patterns or complex events. We thus consider the issues of definition, analysis and enactment for both 'basic' and 'extended' interruption policy models. First, we introduce a method to model interruption policies in an intuitive but executable manner such that they may be maintained without technical support. We then address the issue of execution, detailing the required system functionality and proposing a reference architecture for the automatic enforcement of the policies. Finally, we introduce a set of formal, generic correctness criteria and a verification procedure for the models. For extended policy models, we introduce and compare two alternative execution models for the evaluation of logical expressions that represent interruption patterns. Finally, we present a thorough analysis of related verification issues, considering both the system and user perspectives, in order to ensure correct process execution and also provide support for the user in semantic validation of the interruption policies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workflow systems</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">verification</field><field name="subject">business processes</field><field name="subject">expression evaluation</field><field name="subject">rules</field><field name="subject">specification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFICIENT GRID COMPUTING BASED ALGORITHMS FOR POWER SYSTEM DATA ANALYSIS</field><field name="creator">Mohsin Ali</field><field name="description">The role of electric power systems has grown steadily in both scope and importance over time making electricity increasingly recognized as a key to social and economic progress in many developing countries. In a sense, reliable power systems constitute the foundation of all prospering societies. The constant expansion in electric power systems, along with increased energy demand, requires that power systems become more and more complex. Such complexity results in much uncertainty which demands comprehensive reliability and security assessment to ensure reliable energy supply. Power industries in many countries are facing these challenges and are trying to increase the computational capability to handle the ever-increasing data and analytical needs of operations and planning. Moreover, the deregulated electricity markets have been in operation in a number of countries since the 1990s. During the deregulation process, vertically integrated power utilities have been reformed into competitive markets, with initial goals to improve market efficiency, minimize production costs and reduce the electricity price. Given the benefits that have been achieved by deregulation, several new challenges are also observed in the market. Due to fundamental changes to the electric power industry, traditional management and analysis methods cannot deal with these new challenges. Deterministic reliability assessment criteria still exists but it doesn&#8217;t satisfy the probabilistic nature of power systems. In the deterministic approach the worst case analysis results in excess operating costs. On the other hand, probabilistic methods are now widely accepted. The analytical method uses a mathematical formula for reliability evaluation and generates results more quickly but it needs accurate and a lot of assumptions and is not suitable for large and complex systems. Simulation based techniques take care of much uncertainty and simulates the random behavior of the system. However, it requires much computing power, memory and other computing resources. Power engineers have to run thousands of times domain simulations to determine the stability for a set of credible disturbances before dispatching. For example, security analysis is associated with the steady state and dynamic response of the power system to various disturbances. It is highly desirable to have real time security assessment, especially in the market environment. Therefore, novel analysis methods are required for power systems reliability and security in the deregulated environment, which can provide comprehensive results, and high performance computing (HPC) power in order to carry out such analysis within a limited time. Further, with the deregulation in power industry, operation control has been distributed among many organizations. The power grid is a complex network involving a range of energy resources including nuclear, fossil and renewable energy resources with many operational levels and layers including control centers, power plants and transmission and distribution systems. The energy resources are managed by different organizations in the electricity market and all these participants (including producers, consumers and operators) can affect the operational state of the power grid at any time. Moreover, adequacy analysis is an important task in power system planning and can be regarded as collaborative tasks, which demands the collaboration among the electricity market participants for reliable energy supply. Grid computing is gaining attention from power engineering experts as an ideal solution to the computational difficulties being faced by the power industry. Grid computing infrastructure involves the integrated and collaborative use of computers, networks, databases and scientific instruments owned and managed by multiple organizations. Grid computing technology offers potentially feasible support to the design and development of grid computing based infrastructure for power system reliability and security analysis. It can help in building infrastructure, which can provide a high performance computing and collaborative environment, and offer an optimal solution between cast and efficiency. While power system analysis is a vast topic, only a limited amount of research has been initiated in several places to investigate the applications of grid computing in power systems. This thesis will investigate probabilistic based reliability and security analysis of complex power systems in order to develop new techniques for providing comprehensive result with enormous efficiency. A review of existing techniques was conducted to determine the computational needs in the area of power systems. The main objective of this research is to propose and develop a general framework of computing grid and special grid services for probabilistic power system reliability and security assessment in the electricity market. As a result of this research, grid computing based techniques are proposed for power systems probabilistic load flow analysis, probabilistic small signal analysis, probabilistic transient stability analysis, and probabilistic contingencies analysis. Moreover, a grid computing based system is designed and developed for the monitoring and control of distributed generation systems. As a part of this research, a detailed review is presented about the possible applications of this technology in other aspects of power systems. It is proposed that these grid based techniques will provide comprehensive results that will lead to great efficiency, and ultimately enhance the existing computing capabilities of power companies in a cost-effective manner. At a part of this research, a small scale computing grid is developed which will consist of grid services for probabilistic reliability and security assessment techniques. A significant outcome of this research will be the improved performance, accuracy, and security of data sharing and collaboration. More importantly grid based computing will improve the capability of power system analysis in a deregulated environment where complex and large amounts of data would otherwise be impossible to analyze without huge investments in computing facilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">power system analysis</field><field name="subject">Grid Computing</field><field name="subject">Grid computing based monitoring and control</field><field name="subject">parallel and distributed computing</field><field name="subject">embedded generation system monitoring and control</field><field name="subject">emerging techniques in power system analysis</field><field name="subject">power system security analysis</field><field name="subject">analysis computing grid</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A biochemical analysis of the MAP kinase pathway in mammalian cells</field><field name="creator">Harding, A.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of resin extraction on toasted wood flavours in wine</field><field name="creator">Kang, Sung-Woog</field><field name="description">Woods other than the traditional oak wood have been studied for their applicability to winemaking, aiming to produce wider ranges of wine flavours with a distinctiveness associated with New Zealand. Prior studies with woods other than oak have shown that unpleasant flavours from infusion of some woods could be linked to the presence of resin. The main thrust of this research was to test the hypothesis that any wood free of resin would be suitable for flavouring wine since all trees are composed of the same major constituents. The study involved various organic solvent extractions to remove resins from manuka, macrocarpa, totara, kahikatea, radiata pine, gorse, and American oak, prior to toasting and wine infusion. The woods were cut to a defined chip dimension, and Soxhlet-extracted with dichloromethane before toasting to 200 and 210&#176;C for two and three hours, respectively. These were the light and heavy toasts. In discriminative triangle trials comparing unextracted with resin-extracted infusion treatments in unwooded chardonnay at the two toasting levels, the 50 panellists could distinguish a difference in only three of the 14 trials. The exceptions were manuka heavy toast (P &lt; 0.01), and both macrocarpa toasts (P &lt; 0.05). The remaining 11 trials did not elicit significant levels of correct judgements from the panellists. The mass of resin recovered ranged from 1% (gorse) to 11 % (manuka), but there was no relationship between the quantity of resin and the discrimination results. Other parameters relating to the wood chips were measured in parallel to the discrimination trials. Colour changes in untoasted woods due to resin extraction were usually statistically significant but minor. Colour changes were unrelated to weight losses due to extraction. Light and heavy toasting resulted in significant and often major changes in colour parameters due to resin extraction. However there was no clear pattern of change and thus had no meaningful outcomes. In the discrimination trials, subtleties of the responses to macrocarpa and manuka, suggested that not all resin was extracted by the single extraction with dichloromethane. A further extraction of toasted chips not used for infusion showed that resinous matter was still present in all woods, although pyrolytic generation of dichloromethane-soluble matter could not be excluded. These collective results prompted an exhaustive extraction of wood chips prior to a hedonic trial with manuka, macrocarpa, and American oak. The solvents in sequence were dichloromethane, hexane and diethyl ether. Each extracted some resinous matter, clearly showing that the single dichloromethane extraction prior to the discrimination trials left some resin in the chips, potentially affecting wine flavour. The triple-extracted woods were light toasted and infused in wine destined for a hedonic trial in six retail wine shops, for which the overall statistical significance was P &lt; 0.001. The 121 consumers found that the unwooded chardonnay (control) was most favoured whereas the wine infused with macrocarpa was very significantly the least favoured. Its dislike was clearly caused by presence of its resin in the wine and/or because of a very low flavour threshold for that resin. The manuka treatment was numerically the most favoured ahead of American oak, but not significantly so. The resins extracted at various points of this study were also evaluated by panellists focusing on descriptive qualities. These descriptions and the results of the discrimination and hedonic trials led to the conclusion that variation in wine flavour when infused with toasted wood was in most cases not related to the occurrence of resin in woods. Finally, future research possibilities have been described, with an emphasis of the most potentially useful wood, manuka.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wine</field><field name="subject">Wood</field><field name="subject">Flavour</field><field name="subject">Resin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sedimentological and geochemical approach to understanding cycles of stratovolcano growth and collapse at Mt Taranaki, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zernack, Anke Verena</field><field name="description">The long-term behaviour of andesitic stratovolcanoes is characterised by a repetition of edifice growth and collapse phases. This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of translocation on kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) song and its application to management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van Herpt, Sarah Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis fills a research gap in our knowledge of kokako song by looking at how song evolves in multi-dialect areas. Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community participation in education : does decentralisation matter? An Indonesian case study of parental participation in school management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fitriah, Amaliah</field><field name="description">A prominent idea in the decentralisation and development literature is that decentralisation leads to deeper and stronger community participation. This thesis seeks to examine this argument by investigating the practice of community participation in the Indonesian decentralisation context, focusing on parental participation through access to and control over school financial resources. Drawing on a case study in Depok city, the practice of parental involvement has been explored by identifying the characteristics and the extent of parents&#8217; participation in school management. School Committees (SCs), as a mechanism of community involvement provided by the decentralised education policy, were also examined in this research to develop an understanding of parental representation in school management. The study found that the characteristics and the extent of parents&#8217; participation in school management have changed and decreased significantly as a result of a new Free School Programme (FSP) introduced by the government in 2009 which freed parents from school operational cost. Prior to FSP, parents actively participated in terms of supplying resources and involvement in school meetings, had some access to financial information, and had limited engagement with school budgeting through representation in SCs. However, the new absence of financial contribution by parents has affected parental participation by transforming it into a weaker form of participation where parents act as mere beneficiaries. The study also revealed that in the Indonesian context, the SCs, as institutional channels for community involvement in education provided by the education decentralisation policy, are not effective in terms of representing and engaging parents in school management. Based on the evidence above, this thesis concluded that in the context of the Indonesian education system, decentralisation has not necessarily enhanced community participation. In this respect, decentralisation is not the only possible answer for achieving a meaningful and empowering parental participation in education. Furthermore, other contextual factors surrounding participation also have to be taken into account. While FSP brings the benefit of allowing students to access education freely, the absence of parental financial contribution has been proved to impact parental participation in a way that is contradictory to one of the purposes of decentralisation policy, which is to engage the community in educational management.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School management</field><field name="subject">Free School Programme, Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Educational decentralisation</field><field name="subject">Indonesian education system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analyses of the Terminal Ear 1-like RNA binding proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Doctorate of Philosophy in Plant Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Trainor, Vernon</field><field name="description">In the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) the position at which leaf primordia arise on the periphery, and their subsequent differentiation, have been shown to be (at least in part) to be directed by genetic programs of development. A candidate gene associated with this regulation is TERMINAL EAR 1 (TE 1) a maize gene identified by the irregular phyllotaxy of its mutant lines. Unlike most other genes associated with meristem function, TE 1 is a novel RNA binding gene of the RRM type. It has been shown to have orthologues in a variety of plants including Arabidopsis thaliana as well as unicellular eukaryotes including MEI2, a gene whose product is associated with the regulation of meiosis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In order to more fully understand TE1's role, a functional characterisation of two of the so-called Mei2-like genes was undertaken in the model plant A. thaliana. These genes are called Terminal Ear-Like 1 and 2 (TEL1 and TEL2). Constitutive overexpression of the cDNA of TEL2 using the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S) revealed a phenotype involving an apparently prolonged vegetative phase. However this was only observed in a limited number of lines of the total screened, and the next generation did not reiterate this phenotype. These difficulties were overcome using the LhGpOP construct system for ectopic misexpression in specific domains as well as inducible ubiquitous expression. Ectopic expression of either TEL cDNA is shown to lead to a pleiotrophic spectrum of phenotypes, which in general, were associated with reduced determinant development outside the apical meristems and as well as a delayed overall developmental progression. This provided some evidence that the normal function of TEL genes within the apical meristems is the repression of differentiation associated with the regulation of plant growth and architecture.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maize gene</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological, physiological, and molecular studies on the effect of shoot architecture on phase change and floral transition in Eucalyptus occidentalis and Metrosideros excelsa : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jaya, Elizabeth S.K.D.</field><field name="description">Shoot morphogenesis in Eucalyptus occidentalis and Metrosideros excelsa was analysed at the morphological, physiological and molecular levels to understand the regulation of phase change and the floral transition. Study of the regulation of these developmental plant processes is limited in woody species due to their long juvenile phase. Six ecotypes of E. occidentalis were grown to two predetermined architectures (free branching or single stem). Free branching plants of ecotype 13648 displayed adult shoot phenology (lanceolate leaves) earlier than single stem counterparts. In addition, changes in leaf morphology in free branching plants were accompanied with changes in leaf anatomy and gas exchange signifying that in E. occidentalis complexity of shoot architecture had a significant effect on rate of phase change. Flowering was observed in all but one ecotype irrespective of architecture demonstrating that vegetative phase change and floral transition are temporally uncoupled in this species. To understand the floral transition at the molecular level in E. occidentalis, partial homologues of the inflorescence meristem identity gene TERMINAL FLOWER1 and floral meristem identity genes LEAFY and APETALA1 were isolated. The expression patterns of these meristem identity genes during development of free branching and single stem plants were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. Increased levels of expression of EOLFY and EOAP 1 (relative to &#945; -TUBULIN) were displayed at more proximal nodes in free branching plants than in single stem plants. Elevated floral meristem identity gene expression levels correlated with flower initiation. Further, effects of architecture and environment on gene expression were monitored in E. occidentalis. The overriding effect of shoot architecture on the floral transition was observed under warm long day and ambient environments. Elevated levels of EOLFY and EOAP 1 were correlated with floral bud score and EOAP1 was found to be a reliable marker of floral transition in E. occidentalis. Low levels of EOTFLI expression were detected in buds irrespective of their position on the plant leading to the suggestion that this might have contributed to the precocious flowering observed in this species. In contrast to E. occidentalis, M excelsa attained adult shoot phenology (pubescent leaves) faster when grown as single stem plants than as free branching plants. It appears that growth as height is required for vegetative phase change in this species. However, floral transition occurred only once single stem plants were allowed to branch. Vegetative phase change and the transition to flowering seem to be coordinated in this species with the former being a pre-requisite for the latter.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pohutukawa</field><field name="subject">Morphogenesis</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Floral transition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio credit risk modelling and CDO pricing - analytics and implied trees from CDO tranches</field><field name="creator">Peng, Tao</field><field name="description">One of the most successful and most controversial innovative financial products in recent years has been collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The dimensionality of dependency embedded in a typical CDO structure poses great challenges for researchers - in both generating realistic default dynamics and correlation, and in the mean time achieving fast and accurate model calibration. The research presented in this thesis contributes to the class of bottom-up models, which, as opposed to top-down models, start by modelling the individual obligor default process and then moving them up through the dependency structures to build up the loss distributions at the portfolio level. The Gaussian model (Li 2000) is a static copula model. It has only on correlation parameter, which can be calibrated to one CDO tranche at a time. Its simplicity achieves wide spread industry application even though it suffers from the problem of &#8217;correlation smile&#8217;. In other words, it cannot fit the market in an arbitrage-free manner in the capital-structure dimension. The first contribution of this thesis is the sensitivities analysis with regard to model parameters of expected losses of CDO tranches in the Gaussian and NIG copula models. The study provided substantial insight into the essence of the dependency structure. In addition, we apply the intensity approach to credit modelling in order to imply market distributions non-parametrically in the form of a binomial lattice. Under the same framework, we developed a series of three models. The static binomial model can be calibrated to the CDS index tranches exactly, with one set of parameters. The model can be seen as a non-parametric copula model that is arbitrage free in the capital-structure dimension. Static models are not suitable to price portfolio credit derivatives that are dynamic in nature. The static model can be naturally developed into a dynamic binomial model and satisfies no-arbitrage conditions in the time dimension. This setup, however, reduces model flexibility and calibration speed. The computational complexity comes from the non-Markovian character of the default process in the dynamic model. Inspired by Mortensen (2006), in which the author defines the intensity integral as a conditioning variable, we modify the dynamic model into a Markovian model by modelling the intensity integral directly, which greatly reduces the computational time and increases model fit in calibration. We also show that, when stochastic recovery rates are involved, there is a third no-arbitrage condition for the expected loss process that needs to be built into the Markovian model. For all binomial models, we adopt a unique optimisation algorithm for model calibration - the Cross Entropy method. It is particularly advantageous in solving large-scale non-linear optimsation problems with multiple local extrema, as encountered in our model.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collateralised debt obligations.</field><field name="subject">Binomial coefficients.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The legal regime governing shipping in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Chairijah,</field><field name="description">Marine development, particularly that of the shipping industry, constitutes an integral and essential element of Indonesia's on-going national progress in not only meeting the needs of the domestic movement of npassengers and trade, but also in supporting export and import activities.Sea transportation is still the cheapest, most effective and efficient type of transportation, particularly for the more isolated areas of Indonesia. Despite these benefits sea transportation is potentially risky. For this reason the development and management of shipping must be integrated with other areas of the economy by means of clear and sustainable planning.Obstacles to the rapid development and modernisation include the scarcity of qualified persons, insufficient facilities and infrastructure, hmited budgets, too few marine institutions, and a lack of strong interest in gaining expertise in the marine sector generally. However, significant strides have been made in Indonesia since the 1990s through Government's Long Term Development Plan (PJP).This thesis examines the regulatory framework governing shipping in Indonesia. The areas of focus are the development and implementation of the regulation of shipping and water transportation, including shipowners" responsibility, port management, search and rescue, and court jurisdiction. The thesis argues that the development of the shipping industry really needs to be supported by a proper legal framework, which is inadequate at the moment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of international correspondent banking in Australia</field><field name="creator">Chan, Soon-Lim</field><field name="description">Correspondent banking (corbanking) is basically bank to bank business. With the changing banking environment, corbanking services enter a new phase, from the traditional way of reciprocal products and services received, to the modem way of using corbanking as a strategic tool. Corbanks can offer their clients solutions that cross individual product boundaries and span multiple currencies and geography. Corbanking is therefore identified as a good altemative for boosting profit and share price targets of banks. Corbanking has been neglected in the banking literaUire and many research problems and questions have not been tackled and remain unresolved. This thesis aims at prof ling intemational corbanking practices, operations and management in Australia, leading to answer two questions: why banks choose to enter into corbanking relationships and how they select individual correspondents. Substantial background information derived from chapters of corbanking developments, Australian banking and payment systems, literature reviews and methodology opened the way for original work on a case study of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and an empirical survey of the intemational corbanking industry. Eighteen determinant factors of intemational corbanking relationships and nineteen selection criteria of international correspondents were identified from literature reviews and an exploratory survey. Empirical surveys on forty three corbanking function units of all banking groups in Australia and further categorizing of the ten banking groups were carried out by questionnaires and single or group interviews. The corbanking prof les of CBA and banks in Australia were thereby determined. The results of the survey were used in regression modelling of determinant factors and selection criteria. Simple models of one or two explanatory variables determinant factors and number of correspondents for selection criteria were also concluded for each bank group of the ten banking groups. The most signif&#237;cant factor explaining corbanking relationships for all banks was bank size. In addition for Australian banks a significant explanatory factor was "location not physically present." The most signif&#238;cant criterion for all banks to select correspondents was formal banking presence and less important criteria were operational capabilities and reliability of supply for Australian banks and locations for foreign banks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsive Workflows: Design, Execution and Analysis of Interruption Policy Models</field><field name="creator">Belinda Melanie Carter</field><field name="description">Business processes form the backbone of all business operations, and workflow technology has enabled companies to gain significant productivity benefits through the automatic enactment of routine, repetitive processes. Process automation can be achieved by encoding the business rules and procedures into the applications, but capturing the process logic in a graphical workflow model allows the process to be specified, validated and ultimately maintained by business analysts with limited technical knowledge. The process models can also be automatically verified at design-time to detect structural issues such as deadlock and ensure correct data flow during process execution. These benefits have resulted in the success of workflow technology in a variety of industries, although workflows are often criticised for being too rigid, particularly in light of their recent deployment in collaborative applications such as e-business. Generally, many events can impact on the execution of a workflow process. Initially, the workflow is triggered by an external event (for example, receipt of an order). Participants then interact with the workflow system through the worklist as they perform constituent tasks of the workflow, driving the progression of each process instance through the model until its completion. For traditional workflow processes, this functionality was sufficient. However, new generation 'responsive' workflow technology must facilitate interaction with the external environment during workflow execution. For example, during the execution of an 'order to cash' process, the customer may attempt to cancel the order or update the shipping address. We call these events 'interruptions'. The potential occurrence of interruptions can be anticipated but, unlike the other workflow events, they are never required to occur in order to successfully execute any process instance. Interruptions can also occur at any stage during process execution, and may therefore be considered as 'expected, asynchronous exceptions' during the execution of workflow processes. Every interruption must be handled, and the desired reaction often depends on the situation. For example, an address update may not be permitted after a certain point, where this point depends on the customer type, and a shipping charge or refund may be applicable, depending on the original and new delivery region. Therefore, a set of rules is associated with each interruption, such that if a condition is satisfied when the event occurs, a particular action is to be performed. This set of rules forms a policy to handle each interruption. Several workflow systems do facilitate the automatic enforcement of 'exception handling' rules and support the reuse of code fragments to enable the limited specification and maintenance of rules by non-technical users. However, this functionality is not represented in a formal, intuitive model. Moreover, we argue that inadequate consideration is given to the verification of the rules, with insufficient support provided for the detection of issues at design-time that could hinder effective maintenance of the process logic or interfere with the interruption handling functionality at run-time. This thesis presents a framework to capture, analyse and enforce interruption process logic for highly responsive processes without compromising the benefits of workflow technology. We address these issues in two stages. In the first stage, we consider that the reaction to an interruption event is dependent on three factors: the progress of the process instance with respect to the workflow model, the values of the associated case data variables at the time at which the event occurs, and the data embedded in the event. In the second stage, we consider that the reaction to each interruption event may also depend on the other events that have also been detected, that is, we allow interruptions to be defined through event patterns or complex events. We thus consider the issues of definition, analysis and enactment for both 'basic' and 'extended' interruption policy models. First, we introduce a method to model interruption policies in an intuitive but executable manner such that they may be maintained without technical support. We then address the issue of execution, detailing the required system functionality and proposing a reference architecture for the automatic enforcement of the policies. Finally, we introduce a set of formal, generic correctness criteria and a verification procedure for the models. For extended policy models, we introduce and compare two alternative execution models for the evaluation of logical expressions that represent interruption patterns. Finally, we present a thorough analysis of related verification issues, considering both the system and user perspectives, in order to ensure correct process execution and also provide support for the user in semantic validation of the interruption policies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workflow systems</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">verification</field><field name="subject">business processes</field><field name="subject">expression evaluation</field><field name="subject">rules</field><field name="subject">specification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFICIENT GRID COMPUTING BASED ALGORITHMS FOR POWER SYSTEM DATA ANALYSIS</field><field name="creator">Mohsin Ali</field><field name="description">The role of electric power systems has grown steadily in both scope and importance over time making electricity increasingly recognized as a key to social and economic progress in many developing countries. In a sense, reliable power systems constitute the foundation of all prospering societies. The constant expansion in electric power systems, along with increased energy demand, requires that power systems become more and more complex. Such complexity results in much uncertainty which demands comprehensive reliability and security assessment to ensure reliable energy supply. Power industries in many countries are facing these challenges and are trying to increase the computational capability to handle the ever-increasing data and analytical needs of operations and planning. Moreover, the deregulated electricity markets have been in operation in a number of countries since the 1990s. During the deregulation process, vertically integrated power utilities have been reformed into competitive markets, with initial goals to improve market efficiency, minimize production costs and reduce the electricity price. Given the benefits that have been achieved by deregulation, several new challenges are also observed in the market. Due to fundamental changes to the electric power industry, traditional management and analysis methods cannot deal with these new challenges. Deterministic reliability assessment criteria still exists but it doesn&#8217;t satisfy the probabilistic nature of power systems. In the deterministic approach the worst case analysis results in excess operating costs. On the other hand, probabilistic methods are now widely accepted. The analytical method uses a mathematical formula for reliability evaluation and generates results more quickly but it needs accurate and a lot of assumptions and is not suitable for large and complex systems. Simulation based techniques take care of much uncertainty and simulates the random behavior of the system. However, it requires much computing power, memory and other computing resources. Power engineers have to run thousands of times domain simulations to determine the stability for a set of credible disturbances before dispatching. For example, security analysis is associated with the steady state and dynamic response of the power system to various disturbances. It is highly desirable to have real time security assessment, especially in the market environment. Therefore, novel analysis methods are required for power systems reliability and security in the deregulated environment, which can provide comprehensive results, and high performance computing (HPC) power in order to carry out such analysis within a limited time. Further, with the deregulation in power industry, operation control has been distributed among many organizations. The power grid is a complex network involving a range of energy resources including nuclear, fossil and renewable energy resources with many operational levels and layers including control centers, power plants and transmission and distribution systems. The energy resources are managed by different organizations in the electricity market and all these participants (including producers, consumers and operators) can affect the operational state of the power grid at any time. Moreover, adequacy analysis is an important task in power system planning and can be regarded as collaborative tasks, which demands the collaboration among the electricity market participants for reliable energy supply. Grid computing is gaining attention from power engineering experts as an ideal solution to the computational difficulties being faced by the power industry. Grid computing infrastructure involves the integrated and collaborative use of computers, networks, databases and scientific instruments owned and managed by multiple organizations. Grid computing technology offers potentially feasible support to the design and development of grid computing based infrastructure for power system reliability and security analysis. It can help in building infrastructure, which can provide a high performance computing and collaborative environment, and offer an optimal solution between cast and efficiency. While power system analysis is a vast topic, only a limited amount of research has been initiated in several places to investigate the applications of grid computing in power systems. This thesis will investigate probabilistic based reliability and security analysis of complex power systems in order to develop new techniques for providing comprehensive result with enormous efficiency. A review of existing techniques was conducted to determine the computational needs in the area of power systems. The main objective of this research is to propose and develop a general framework of computing grid and special grid services for probabilistic power system reliability and security assessment in the electricity market. As a result of this research, grid computing based techniques are proposed for power systems probabilistic load flow analysis, probabilistic small signal analysis, probabilistic transient stability analysis, and probabilistic contingencies analysis. Moreover, a grid computing based system is designed and developed for the monitoring and control of distributed generation systems. As a part of this research, a detailed review is presented about the possible applications of this technology in other aspects of power systems. It is proposed that these grid based techniques will provide comprehensive results that will lead to great efficiency, and ultimately enhance the existing computing capabilities of power companies in a cost-effective manner. At a part of this research, a small scale computing grid is developed which will consist of grid services for probabilistic reliability and security assessment techniques.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Search Conference: Application in a Rural Community</field><field name="creator">Breinl, James David</field><field name="description">The search conference was held at Mareeba (North Queensland) to have the community identify ways to help reduce the region's unemployment.

Each browse supplement was fed at four levels: 0 %, 0.83 % liveweight (LW), 1.66 % LW and at ad libitum. The intakes of dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM), DM and OM digestibility, nitrogen (N) digestibility and balance, and liveweight gain were evaluated during a 5 week trial. For goats offered both leucaena and sesbania there was no significant (p&lt;0.05) difference in DM or OM intakes between 0.83 % LW and 1.66 % LW levels of browse supplementation. When both lecaena and sesbania were offered ad libitum the DM and OM intakes were significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower than for either 0.83 % LW or 1.66 % LW level of supplementation. Feeding both leucaena and sesbania increased the DM and OM digestibility coefficients significantly over thos of the controls. The growth rates for goats supplemented with leucaena at various levels were not significantly different from each other. For the goats offered sesbania at ad libitum, their growth rates were significantly lower than for those fed sesbania at either 0.83 % LW or 1.66 % LW. The apparent digestibility of nitrogen (ADN) was not significantly different among leucaena supplemented treatments. For goats offered sesbania, the ADN was significantly higher than for the controls.

Total soil nitrogen and organic carbon were also included as estimates of soil nitrogen status. The results obtained by the waterlogged (WL) method were used to evaluate the results obtained by the three rapid chemical methods. The results show that of the three rapid chemical methods 2 M KCL was the most closely correlated with the waterlogged incubation method. Total N and organic C were also highly correlated with the WL method and they may have value as indices of nitrogen availability. The available N, total N and organic C contents in the 0-5 cm and 5-15cm layer soils were consistently higher under greenpanic and lucerne than for the annual crop treatments. The available N contents as determined by the WL method in the 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm soil layers under greenpanic and lucerne ranged from 75.6 to 126.5 ug N/g soil and 53.2 to 106.7 ug N/g soil, respectively, whereas the values under the annual crop treatments ranged from 13.2 to 75.3 ug N/g soil and 25.6 to 66.1 ug N/g soil, respectively. The total N contents in the 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm layer soils under the greenpanic and lucerne ranged from 0.29 to 0.38 % and 0.20 to 0.33 %, respectively, whereas the values under the annual crop treatments ranged from 0.17 to 0.31 % and 0.17 to 0.25 %, respectively. The availability of the total N as indicated by the available N as a percentage of the total N in the 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm layer soils under the greenpanic and lucerne ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 % and 2.1 to 3.2 %, respectively, whereas the values under the annual crop treatments ranged from 0.8 to 3.8 % and 1.5 to 2.4 %, respectively. In addition the organic C contents in the 0.5 cm and 5-15 cm layer soils under the greenpanic and lucerne range from 2.4 to 4.0 % and 2.0 to 3.5 %, respectively, whereas the values under the annual crop treatments ranged from 1.4 to 3.3 % and 1.7 to 2.7 %, respectively.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0703 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="subject">monoculture</field><field name="subject">sorghum</field><field name="subject">mungbean</field><field name="subject">oats</field><field name="subject">greenpanic</field><field name="subject">lucerne</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">clay soil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:207755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Airway smooth muscle response to vibrations</field><field name="creator">Du, Youhua</field><field name="description">The main goal of this research was the in vitro investigation of the stiffness response of contracted airway smooth muscles under different external oscillations. Living animal airway smooth muscle tissues were dissected from pig tracheas and stimulated by a chemical stimulus (acetylcholine). These tissues were then systematically excited with different external vibrations. The force change was recorded to reflect the muscle stiffness change under vibration. The static and dynamic stiffness of contracted airway smooth muscles in isometric contraction were determined before, during and after vibrations. A continuum cross-bridge dynamic model (the fading memory model) was modified to accommodate smooth muscle behaviour and dynamically describes the cross-bridge kinetics. A two-dimensional finite element model (FEM) was developed to simulate longitudinal and transverse vibrations of the tissue. An empirical equation, derived from the experiments, is incorporated into the FEM. The results indicate that the stiffness of active smooth muscles can be physically reduced using external vibrations. This reduction is caused by a certain physical position change between actin and myosin. The dynamic stiffness has the tendency of decreasing as the frequency and/or amplitude of external vibration increases. However, the static stiffness decreases with an increase in the frequency and amplitude of excitation until it reaches a critical value of frequency where no variation in stiffness is observed. It is postulated that the tissue elasticity and mass inertia are the main contributors to the dynamic stiffness while the actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling is the main contributor to the static stiffness.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Muscle response</field><field name="subject">Effect of vibration on airway</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect of vibration</field><field name="subject">Airway smooth muscle</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student attitudes towards and perceptions of ePortfolios in a first year Japanese language programme</field><field name="creator">Moffat, Sonja</field><field name="description">Research into learner autonomy has confirmed the importance of learner competencies such as effective strategy use, goal setting and planning, maintaining motivation, and the ability to reflect and self-evaluate to the development of autonomy. The introduction of key competency frameworks to develop learner autonomy has been a focus of recent curriculum development from primary through to tertiary levels in the New Zealand education system.  However, facilitating and managing the development of these learning competencies in a programme of study that has a number of different papers and staff, can be problematic. The learning portfolio is emerging as a possible medium to provide the required framework.  This study investigated the effectiveness of an ePortolio in enhancing learner autonomy in the context of a language learning programme. The aim of this study was to gain insight from a student perspective into the usfulness of ePortfolios as a tool to enhance student learning. Investigating learner autonomy and the development of self-reflection resulting from the use of ePortfolios was the main focus of the study. It also examined some of the practicalities of using an ePortfolio to develop the desired learner competencies, and discussed whether an ePortfolio provides an effective framework to record, monitor and provide feedback to students. The results of the study reinforce the findings of previous studies in that there are benefits of ePortfolios as they encourage reflection. ePortfolios also have the potential to support the reflective process by making learning outcomes visible and they promote goal-setting. However, despite these apparent benefits, the findings suggest that there are many challenges, which have the potential to negatively influence its effectiveness. The ePortfolio in this study was used with varying degrees of success.  The findings have raised several issues regarding the introduction of an ePortfolio. The time it takes for teachers to give individual feedback and maintain an adequate level of feedback throughout the semester was one major challenge. The extent to which learners need to be trained in the purpose of the ePortfolio and its link to reflection and developing autonomy was another issue that was raised. In addition, getting students to reflect on their learning holistically also proved to be problematic.  Overall however, findings as to the effectiveness of the ePortfolio in promoting autonomous learning appear promising, but they have highlighted the need to make changes to the ePortfolio itself. Its integration into the curriculum needs to be reconsidered to maximize its use and gain maximum benefit.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ePortfolios</field><field name="subject">Portfolios</field><field name="subject">Autonomy</field><field name="subject">Reflection</field><field name="subject">Self-assessment</field><field name="subject">Goal-setting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Under a big sky</field><field name="creator">Hanifin, Patricia Mary</field><field name="description">The exegesis will elaborate on the research process undertaken to write a collection of short fiction. The creative work is a collection of ten stories linked thematically by an archaeological approach to character psychology, expression and action. Some of the stories also explore the influence of popular culture and cultural archetypes on the characters. Important contemporary influences in terms of both content and style have been the short stories, Wheat by Tracy Slaughter (2004), Walking to Laetoli by James George (2004) and Aquifier by Tim Winton (2004). The introduction of the exegesis outlines my interests in the modern &#8216;slice of life&#8217; story, in the conflict and tensions that occur between emotional and chronological time, and in Charles May&#8217;s assertion that short stories, through their use of metaphor, are a vehicle for exploring mythological perception. The theorists who most influenced my research and creative writing are then highlighted and their contribution to my understanding of narrative technique is discussed. Four main narrative techniques are emphasised, and illustrated with reference to particular stories from the collection. The techniques discussed are all related to the fundamental craft issue of show don&#8217;t tell. Finally the exegesis touches on the difficulty a writer has in being an objective reader of their own work.

The aim of this research enquiry is to identify, generate and describe a theoretical explanation of how a client engages in and manages their relationship with their health professional over a period of time. Fifteen participants living with chronic medical conditions were interviewed over a period of four months with data collected via unstructured in-depth interview sessions, and analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis reveals three major themes, nature of relationship, degree of control and service satisfaction. Of central concern is the longevity of the relationship between the healthcare client and his/her service provider. If the service provider is willing to share their authority and relinquish some of the control to the client, the client feels empowered. The client is then willing to provide information and effort to co-create effective service episodes. This sharing of authority enables the client to have better control on their service consumption. The sharing of authority also has an impact on the client&#8217;s propensity to remain engaged with their service provider. The findings of this study have implications for our knowledge and understanding of professional service delivery and how it differs from the delivery of consumer services. The study clearly indicates a shift in the role of a client as an empowered entity who wants to be part of, not just the service consumption, but service production as well. The key lessons from this study may inform other types of services including financial, educational and consulting services.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Professional services</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">Service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foot and ankle characteristics in patients with chronic Gout: a case controlled study</field><field name="creator">Survepalli, David George</field><field name="description">Introduction: Gout affects approximately 15% of Maori and Pacific men, these men being at risk of early onset, severe disease with formation of gouty tophi and joint damage. Gout most frequently affects the foot, particularly the big toe and midfoot. This disease initially presents as self-limiting attacks of severe joint inflammation, and in the presence of persistent hyperuricaemia, tophaceous disease may also develop. Tophi are collections of monosodium urate crystals surrounded by chronic inflammatory cells and connective tissue. Tophi typically occur in both subcutaneous tissues and within affected joints, and may cause pain, cosmetic problems, mechanical obstruction of joint movement, and joint destruction. Despite the predilection of gout to the foot, the impact of gout on foot function is currently unknown and only case studies relating to hallux pain, tibial sesamoid pain and longitudinal tears in peroneal tendons have been reported in the literature. The aim of this study is to assess the intra-tester reliability of certain biomechanical tests to evaluate foot structure and function (plantar pressure measurements, gait parameters, range of motion at the ankle and first MTPJ and the foot posture index) in individuals with gout and to assess the differences between disability, impairment, foot structure and function between individuals with gout and non-gout controls. Subjects: A total of 25 patients with chronic gout with a mean age of 61.2 (11.7) years old were recruited from a rheumatology clinic within the Auckland District Health Board. A further 25 age-and sex-matched controls with a mean age of 57.3 (12.2) years old were recruited from AUT University. Methods: Disability, impairment, foot structure and foot function were assessed for the gout and the control group. Disability and impairment was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire, Foot Function Index, Leeds Foot Impact Scale and Lower Limb Task Questionnaire. Foot structure was investigated using the Foot Posture Index, first metatarsophangeal joint (MTPJ) dorsiflexion, ankle dorsiflexion movement, subtalar joint and midtarsal joint motion, Foot Problem Score, tophi count and muscle strength of extrinsic and intrinsic foot muscles. Foot function was investigated using an in-shoe pressure system measuring mean peak plantar pressures and pressure-time integrals. Temporal-spatial gait parameters were evaluated, as well as peripheral sensation and vibration perception threshold. Plantar pressures were assessed using the Tekscan pressure insole system, gait parameters were measured using the Gaitmat walkway system, peripheral sensation and vibration threshold were assessed using 10gm monofilament and biothesiometer respectively. Intra-tester reliability was investigated using ICC, Standard Error of Measurement and Smallest Real Difference in the gout group for key measures (Foot Posture Index, first MTPJ dorsiflexion, ankle dorsiflexion movement, peak plantar pressures, pressure-time integrals and gait parameters). To investigate the significant difference between the groups, the left and right foot in gout were compared with the left foot of the control group using ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons. Non-parametric tests were used for muscle strength, peripheral sensation and Foot Problem Score and motion at the subtalar and midtarsal joints for comparison between the groups. Walking velocity, cadence and disability and impairment scores between the groups were assessed using an independent t-test with 95% confidence intervals. Significance for all these measures was set to 0.05 except for Chi square where a significance of 0.02 was set. Results: The ICC for the intra-tester reliability was excellent with low measurement error for the measured outcomes. The gout group recorded significantly higher disability and impairment scores than controls (p&lt;0.01). Significant differences between the two groups were recorded for vibration pressure threshold, muscle strength, Foot Problem Score, first MTPJ dorsiflexion, foot motion and gait parameters (p&lt;0.05). Significant differences were demonstrated under the toes for mean plantar pressures and under the lateral heel, midfoot and hallux regions for pressure-time integrals in the gout cases (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Individuals with gout have reduced quality of life due to greater disability and impairment. The gouty foot is slightly supinated with reduced dorsiflexion at the first MTPJ. Rearfoot and forefoot motions are limited with a high incidence of digital deformities and dermatological lesions. The foot function in gout is characterized by reduced walking velocity, cadence, step and stride length. The plantar pressures are reduced under the toes with increased duration of loading under the hallux, lateral heel and midfoot regions. Further research using three-dimensional gait analysis is recommended to quantify motion at the foot and ankle joints and also to ascertain the role of proximal joints. Future work could be undertaken to evaluate the impact of acute gout on objective measures of foot function, and to determine predictors of poor foot function in patients with this disease. This will allow further work to investigate or formulate a podiatric management plan in conjunction with pharmacological therapy to improve impairment, disability and function in chronic gout.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gout</field><field name="subject">Foot</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Foot function</field><field name="subject">Disability</field><field name="subject">Activity limitation</field><field name="subject">Shoes</field><field name="subject">Foot structure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Students and academic success: the role of campus climate, peer and faculty support</field><field name="creator">Zagreanu, Claudia</field><field name="description">Background: English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) students, enrolled in health care tertiary education, have lower graduation rates compared with English native speakers. The demographic profile of most western countries is continuously changing and therefore this issue has became a concern especially for those countries which are confronted with an acute health care workforce shortage. One of the most important predictors in student retention is their perception of academic success. The purpose of this study was to explore ESOL health undergraduate students&#8217; perceptions of campus climate, faculty and peer social support, and sought to determine whether or not there is a relationship between these factors and ESOL students&#8217; perception academic success. Methods: The study was carried out at Auckland University of Technology (AUT). The inclusion criteria for this study were: undergraduate students enrolled with the Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences, having other than English as their first language, and studying predominantely on one of AUT University&#8217;s campuses, namely Akoranga campus. The study implemented had a cross-sectional design using a novel purpose built electronic survey. ESOL health undergraduate students&#8217; insights were explored using a 22-item web-based survey consisting of three scales: peer and faculty support, campus climate, and academic success. The content validity and realiability of each scale were tested. The study questionnaire was made available online to all ESOL health undergraduate students willing to participate in the research. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the study hypothesis. Six related binary outcome variables, measuring perceptions of academic success, were included in the analyses. Results: Twenty-seven ESOL health undergraduate students from a variety of health undergraduate programs agreed to participate in the research. The majority of participants were of Asian ethnicity with ages between 21 and 30 years and had completed their secondary education overseas. The GEE analyses showed that campus climate was significantly associated with academic success, p-value=0.01, but peer and faculty support was not, p-value=0.07. The estimated odds ratio (OR) for the campus climate relationship implies that for every unit increase in the first principal component factor for campus climate, the odds that a participant agreed with the academic success scale decreased by 0.43 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.84). The only open-ended question of the survey revealed that 39% of the participants did not intend to leave the faculty before graduation, while 17% saw the &#8220;lack of support&#8221; as a possible reason for abandoning the university without a degree. Conclusion: ESOL undergraduate students&#8217; perception of campus climate may have an influence on their perception of academic success. Students&#8217; perception of peer and faculty support was not significantly associated with academic success, but 17% of respondents to the open-ended question saw &#8220;lack of support&#8221; as a possible reason to leave the course before graduation. The findings were hampered by the small sample of ESOL students recruited.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ESOL</field><field name="subject">Campus climate</field><field name="subject">Academic success</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specialised non-invasive blood pressure measurement algorithm</field><field name="creator">Lin, Han-Chun (Vivien)</field><field name="description">Blood pressure is one of the fundamental clinical measures. For more than 100 years, clinicians and researchers have used the mercury sphygmomanometer for blood pressure measurement. Environmental concern about mercury contamination has highlighted the need to find a replacement for traditional mercury sphygmomanometers. A number of currently used non-invasive blood pressure measurement methods have been studied in this research. The most commonly used automatic pressure monitoring method nowadays is the Oscillometric method. Height-based and Slope-based criteria are the two general means used to determine the systolic and diastolic pressures. However, these two criteria have many disputed points, making them debatable as a good standard for blood pressure measurement. For this reason, the auscultatory method continues to be the gold-standard for non-invasive blood pressure measurement. Current research uses a newly developed cuff with three different lengths of piezo film sensors and a pressure sensor to collect signals from the brachial artery. The objectives of the research are to process the measured signal from the sensors and develop a blood pressure measurement algorithm that will accurately determine the blood pressure noninvasively. Signal processing and heart beat / heart rate detection software have been developed. The best algorithm has been selected from three developed algorithms for further modification and validation. The final algorithm used two feed-forward Neural Networks to classify the acquired pressure signals into various regions of the pressure signals. The final algorithm has been tested on 258 measurements from 86 subjects. The testing result showed that the algorithm achieved grade A for both systolic and diastolic pressures according to the British Hypertension Society protocol. The mean differences (SD) between the observers and the developed algorithm were 1.44 (5.27) mmHg and 1.77 (6.17) mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively, which also fulfilled the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation protocol. In conclusion, this algorithm was successfully developed and it is recommended for further clinical trial in a wider adult population. Further development of this algorithm also includes extending to other subgroups such as pregnant women, arrhythmia, diabetics and other subjects with diseases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood pressure measurement</field><field name="subject">Measurement algorithms</field><field name="subject">Digital Signal Processing</field><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A simulation model of infant-incubator-feedback system with humidification and temperature control</field><field name="creator">Al-Taweel, Yasser Amer</field><field name="description">A comprehensive simulation model for the infant-incubator-feedback system was developed in a Matlab/Simulink&#174; environment to investigate all heat exchange relationships, variables and factors that have an influence on the overall thermo-neutrality of the environment. The model was also used to determine the benefits and limitations of using a convectively heated single-walled incubator in nursing preterm infants with very low birth weight &lt; 1000 grams and low gestational age 28 weeks. The infant was modelled as one-lump with two layers; core and skin. The infant shape was approximated to a cylinder. The model incorporated all compartments of the infant-incubator system including core, skin, incubator air space, mattress, incubator walls, air-circulating fan, heating element, added oxygen (for resuscitation purposes), and humidification chamber, which has not previously been considered. The results of the simulation were in terms of the temperature variation over time, of the following parts of the system: core and skin temperatures and incubator air space temperature. Results of the simulation with added humidity showed that the body temperature of a 900 gram infant, with an initial body temperature of 35.5 &#186;C, did not reach the thermo-neutral range between 36.5-37.5 &#186;C in two hours, on air mode. Whereas, on skin mode, both core and skin temperature reached to 36.87 &#186;C and 36.5 &#186;C in two hours, and thus a thermo-neutral environment was achieved. These outcomes are consistent with clinical empirical reports. The simulation model is a closed-loop system with a PID controller for each mode; air servo controlled and skin servo controlled. The controller parameters were virtually estimated by the Zeigler-Nichols Method as real values were not available. Nevertheless, the overall stability of the whole system has been achieved by applying a step input which was verified by the Root Locus Method.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Simulation models</field><field name="subject">Infant incubator feedback systems</field><field name="subject">Temperature control</field><field name="subject">Sisotool Simulink</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/975</field></doc></add>
