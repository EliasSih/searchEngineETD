As a result of relocation, immigrant women &#8211; compared to male immigrants &#8211; are considered to experience greater hardships, often connected to the influence of traditional gender values and roles, restricted political support, and the lack of adequate social services to facilitate their integration. Australia is, essentially, a land of immigrants. International immigration represents one of its major sources of population and economic growth. However, the integration of immigrants is a controversial and often conflictive issue. In spite of Australia&#8217;s endorsement of multiculturalism, the influence of the historic white Australian ideals remains as an informal expectation to assimilate ethnically divergent minorities. The Latin American community in Australia is large and has contributed, not only to the economic prosperity of the country, but also to its cultural diversity. Despite official discourses, however, Latin American immigrants do not encounter the same labour and economic opportunities, and often experience severe social challenges and discrimination. In seeking to understand the specific acculturation challenges of Latin American females in Australia, 13 women &#8211; living in Australia for an average of 32 years &#8211; were interviewed using an open-ended schedule. The data from the interviews was qualitatively analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Main findings indicate that most participants &#8211; although some achieved positive levels of labour integration &#8211; remained socially separated from the mainstream society, exchanging mostly with other immigrants. The maintenance of traditional gender roles within their households, restricted sources of social support and family assistance in Australia, and poor support from the mainstream society translated into low levels of psychological adjustment. These factors interacted, rather than operating as separate variables. Under the socio-politic and ideological circumstances encountered in Australia, a complete integration was not possible. Acculturation, to most women, was experienced as a never-ending process where many conflictive issues remained unresolved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">School of Social Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/2051/1/THESIS_ROMINA_IEBRA_AIZPURUA.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Everyday Lives of Men: An Ethnographic Investigation of Young Adult Male Identity</field><field name="creator">Gill, Peter</field><field name="description">There has been increasing social debate in recent times surrounding men&#8217;s identities, men&#8217;s health and wellbeing, and men&#8217;s place within contemporary western society. The purpose of this thesis was to contribute to new knowledge of these issues through an ethnographic exploration of two small sub-cultures of young adults. Utilising participant observation the researcher described in detail the ways in which masculinities were constructed in everyday life. The researcher spent over 2 years as a participant observer of a small group of men from a gymnasium in Melbourne, which followed a briefer but still illuminating period spent with a group of men from a small community in Australia. An ethnographic approach and a non-clinical and nondeviant sample were used to build in-depth knowledge from a neutral lens that did not assume an existing male deficit or crisis. The major findings revolved around the complexity of the male social networks, including the men&#8217;s need for belonging and in particular same sex friendships, the implicit and explicit rules of engagement, rational reflective discussion, and male engagement in their social worlds. In addition this thesis illuminated the salient masculine discourses for constructing and negotiating identities, which included heterosexual attraction, competition and social comparison, and biological predispositions and simplicity. This thesis also presents a dynamic psychosocial theory of male identity, and illustrates the relevance of this theory to the everyday lives of men. The men were shown to both collectively and individually negotiate and construct their identities by utilising the key processes of identification, sublimation, and reflection. By combining both phenomenological and discursive research methods the researcher was able to illustrate in everyday life the dialectic between the social and subjective elements of identity. The researcher also discusses the challenges he faced as an ethnographic fieldworker, and contributes to the development of improved understandings of the practical requirements of fieldwork, such as time, support, and flexibility.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">School of Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/2052/1/The_everyday_lives_of_men.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How Can Sultan Qaboos University Respond to the Contemporary Challenges of the Omani Labour Market Needs and Community Expectations?</field><field name="creator">Al-Balushi, Abdul Latif</field><field name="description">Higher education systems in developing countries have mixed results in satisfying their nations&#8217; labour market requirements, and community needs and expectations. Oman, a member of the Gulf Country Council (GCC), sustained the rapid economic development that has featured within the region over the past three decades. However, a contentious issue for the GCC, including Oman, is the provision of higher education qualifications sufficient for graduates to compete successfully in local labour markets dominated by experienced expatriates. This study explores the factors contributing to high unemployment for the mass communications graduates of Oman&#8217;s principal educational facility, Sultan Qaboos University (SQU). Semi-structured interviews with graduates, students and their parents, university and government representatives and public and private employers have revealed a range of views about the employability of the graduates and the university course which sought to prepare them for the labour market. The analysis of the interview data revealed that conventional human capital themes failed to account for the range of views about the effects of the course on graduate employability. Until a decade ago, human capital principles that value years of learning served Oman well as it provided sufficient educational capacity to deliver graduates for its expanding public services. However, when the country&#8217;s burgeoning public sector ceased the automatic acceptance of SQU graduates, later cohorts from mass communications courses were unable to source work in Oman&#8217;s small private sector mass media industry. The findings from the study were that traditional human capital accumulation is insufficient to deliver jobs; the human risk capital is too high. Risk factors for mass communications students include course admission, curriculum content and delivery, language fluency and technology. Further, employer perceptions of the mass communications qualification and of graduates&#8217; commitment to a work ethic were barriers to employment. A significant contribution of the research is the recognition that the framework of educational practices, associated with what has been termed social capital, provides an alternative and more constructive means of analysis the data. The findings of the research point to the need for a university in a country such as Oman to expand its educational responsibility by taking on a social capital curriculum whose principal feature is the establishment of communicative links between local communities, the university and workplaces. A social capital curriculum, increasingly pursued as best practice for developed countries, can deliver work ready graduates acceptable to employers. Valid for GCC and wider use, a model of the capital theory elements, processes and risks is included in this comparative study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">School of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/2055/1/Al-Balushi_Abdul-Latif_Ph_D_Thesis.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sleep inertia and alcohol impairment in young adults: Neurocognitive effects and interactions Implications for fire escape behaviours</field><field name="creator">Tokley, Melanie Joy</field><field name="description">Alcohol intoxication is known to considerably increase the probability of death from fire across the lifespan, to the extent that it has been isolated as the single most significant risk factor. The study investigated the combined effects of sleep inertia and alcohol impairment on fire emergency-relevant cognitive performance indicators in a young adult population. Mental tracking, visual scanning, psychomotor speed, working memory and sustained, selective, and divided attention functions were assessed for performance decrements and reference to speed-accuracy trade-off effects. Participants were 24 young adults (18-26 years) who participated in a repeated-measures study over 2 nonconsecutive nights; 1 night with alcohol administration and 1 &#8216;sober&#8217; night. During the alcohol administration night, 10-minute testing blocks occurred under (1) baseline sober and (2) baseline 0.05 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) conditions. Subsequently, subjects were awoken from stage 4 sleep and assessed in two consecutive 10-minute blocks (3) and (4). Self-reports of sleepiness and clearheadedness were also taken. The same procedure was used during the sober night (with condition (2) excluded). All cognitive functions assessed showed an alcohol effect (i.e., decrements between sober baseline (1) and conditions of alcohol (2)), and an even larger sleep inertia effect (i.e., greater decrements between sober baseline (1) and conditions of sleep inertia alone (3) and (4)). Sleep inertia selectively affected performance speed on the working memory task, whilst performance accuracy on this task was affected by conditions of alcohol impairment only. When the sober and alcohol nights were compared, there was no combined or synergistic interaction between sleep inertia and alcohol impairment on the cognitive tasks or subjective measures during the first 10 minutes of sleep inertia. Conditions of combined sleep inertia and alcohol impairment produced cognitiveperformance decrements that were greater than those produced by alcohol administrationalone, but not those produced by sleep inertia alone. Indeed, sleep inertia effectsappeared to &#8216;override&#8217; alcohol effects. At 10-20 minutes post-awakening, however, sleepinertia effects began to dissipate, thus &#8216;unmasking&#8217; alcohol effects on some tasks,including accuracy of working memory performance, selective/sustained attention and subjective sleepiness. Divided attention performance demonstrated a complex and unpredictable pattern at 10-20 minutes post-awakening whereby performance under conditions of sleep inertia and alcohol intoxication combined became significantly worse than either condition alone, indicating that alcohol effects were also possibly being unmasked for this measure. Other measures (speed of working memory performance and subjective clearheadedness) showed no difference between conditions at 10-20 minutes post-awakening. The results suggest that (1) moderate alcohol impairment and sleep inertia do not combine to produce further decrements in neurocognitive functioning than those caused by the effects of alcohol or sleep inertia alone and (2) sleep inertia poses a greater risk to fire emergency escape than moderate alcohol impairment. Moreover this data suggests that when awoken abruptly in an emergency situation, prior alcohol consumption to 0.05 BAC will not further impede cognitive functioning that is already compromised by a state of sleep inertia. The study considers the importance of the arousing effects of task complexity, the BAC curve (particularly the descending limb), and speed-accuracy trade-off effects in predicting the effects of sleep inertia and alcohol on cognitive performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">School of Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15209/1/Melanie_Tokley_Thesis.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial accounting disclosures and corporate governance in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Beh, Chooi San</field><field name="description">The paper is on Malaysia, an emerging market, which had enjoyed strong economic activity with growth of 8-9% p.a. for a decade before the Asian financial crisis hit the region in 1997. The local currencies in the region came under pressure as capital took flight from the region. Credit and trade receivables became difficult. Assets and share values plunged dramatically as demand fell. A number of companies which had expanded rapidly through acquisitions and diversification with heavy borrowings in the past became insolvent. Investors and other stakeholders lost money with the failure of the companies. Many blamed the inadequate financial information and poor corporate governance as agency issues for their loss. Using the data of companies with poor earnings that were subsequently placed on the KLSE PN4 list, the study confirmed previous studies that earnings affect share prices. The share prices fell with negative earnings and remained low with declining earnings up to the PN4 announcements in 2001. Earnings management was evidenced by the use of the statistical model and the high standard deviation. There was, however, a marked change in 2005. Good management practices and transparency in financial information promotes growth.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Applied Economics</field><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15210/1/beh.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information systems in general practice: a framework to implement the management and prevention of chronic diseases</field><field name="creator">Carbone, Daniel R.</field><field name="description">The aim of this research project was to develop an implementation framework for the prevention and management of chronic diseases in general practice.

Irrelevant (distractor) information, however, typically is not filtered completely and impacts on responses to the goal. Recent theories of selective attention indicate that distractor interference is determined by the perceptual load of a visual display and the availability of cognitive control mechanisms (working memory load). It is unclear however, which mechanisms assist efficient selective attention and how irrelevant distracting information is rejected. Using a go/no-go visual attention task (Experiment 1) and a visual search task (Experiment 2), this series of experiments examined distractor processing in visual selective attention.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">School of Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15212/1/Kotsopoulos_Eleftheria_Visual_Attention.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of organisational fit in determining performance: a case study analysis of heritage visitor attractions</field><field name="creator">Nankervis, Antony Richard Ward</field><field name="description">Attractions are both an essential element of the tourism product, and an important catalyst for economic activity, particularly in regional locations. The ability of competing tourist destinations to differentiate their tourism product by emphasising the distinctive nature of attractions within their domain, is central to tourism marketing, and thereby to viable tourism industry. Ensuring their sustainable operation is an important priority. Like most organisations however, attractions are subject to a range of internal and external influences that impact on their ability to operate effectively. The ability to successfully respond to constant and pervasive change presents a significant challenge for this important sector of the tourism industry. Despite their importance however, the specific elements of change confronting the attraction sector, or the means by which they adapt to such shifts, are not well understood and this thesis seeks to help address this gap. Drawing on the perceptions and opinions of key stakeholders in two regional heritage visitor attractions, the research seeks to identify structural and strategic responses to change. Aggregation of the data points to significant commonality between the two case studies, in terms of perceived success factors and impediments to the process of adaption.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">School of Hospitality Tourism and Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15213/1/SA-Nankervis.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of fairness perception of performance measurement in the balanced scorecard environment</field><field name="creator">Aryani, Y Anni</field><field name="description">Prior studies have identified problems with traditional management control and performance measurement systems to evaluate managerial and business unit performance (Kaplan and Norton, 1996; Olve, Roy, and Wetter, 1999). One response has been the use of the balanced scorecard (BSC) to provide a more causal-linked comprehensive set of financial and non-financial measures of performance. However, recent research suggests the use of the BSC has its own difficulties including one referred to as common-measure bias (Lipe and Salterio, 2000); accordingly the benefits of the BSC cannot be fully exploited. Drawing on organisational justice theories, this study proposes a fairness model to help overcome the problem of common-measure bias found by Lipe and Salterio (2000) in the BSC environment. Using the concepts of fairness perception, divisional/unit manager participation and interpersonal trust between the parties involved in the performance evaluation process, the model investigates issues associated with common-measure bias in the context of a BSC environment. This fairness model provides a review of the relationship between the drivers of fairness perception, which include participation, procedural justice, and distributive justice on the performance measurement in a BSC environment, and the interpersonal trust between parties involved in the performance evaluation process. The effects of those variables on managerial performance also are considered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Accounting and Finance</field><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15214/1/Aryani.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping professional development in TAFE</field><field name="creator">Bradley, Patricia Joan</field><field name="description">Since beginning in 1974, Technical and Further Education (TAFE) in Australia has experienced significant changes due to the implementation of a series of government policies of vocational education and training reform. TAFE teachers are now part of a national Vocational Education and Training (VET) system and responsible for the delivery of National Training Packages and the Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF). Seemingly, the Australian government has underlined the value of a constructivist learning theory by actively seeking to embed this theory through initiatives originally implemented by the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA). These include a major pedagogical change to a student-centred approach that allows multiple perspectives and stresses the importance of collaboration. Since the abolition of ANTA in 2004, their former roles were absorbed by the Federal Government Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) and later by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR). The aim of this qualitative study was to learn how TAFE teachers felt about various professional development activities and examine their individual perceptions of issues, concerns and assumptions about change in their working lives. Ethnographic techniques and participant observation enabled the gathering of primary data. The subsequent identification and rich description of their life in their educational environment added a cultural dimension that is not readily available through the application of quantitative or experimental methods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">School of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15215/1/Patricia_Bradley.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching English as a foreign language in Oman: an exploration of English Language teaching pedagogy in tertiary education</field><field name="creator">Al-jadidi, Husna Suleiman S</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on research conducted between 2004 and 2007 into the teaching of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in tertiary education institutions in Oman.

When there is no suspect, it would be useful for the police to be able to predict what the person of interest looks like by analysing the DNA left behind in a crime scene. Determination of the age of the suspect is an important factor in creating an &#8220;identikit&#8221; (set of drawings of different features that can be put together to form the face of a person). This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual from their DNA. Telomere length, in buccal cells, of 167 individuals aged between 1 and 96 years old was measured using quantitative real time PCR. The causes for the presence of large variation in telomere lengths in the population were further investigated. The age prediction accuracies were low even after dividing samples into non-related Europeans, males and females (5%, 9% and 1% respectively). Mean telomere lengths of eight age groups representing each decade of life showed a non-linear decrease in telomere length with age. There were variations in telomere lengths even among similarly aged individuals aged 26 years old (n = 10) and age 54 years old (n = 9). One of the factors that causes large inter individual variation could be the inheritance of telomere length. If there is a strong paternal or maternal influence, this could be incorporated into the age prediction formula. Parents&#8217; telomere lengths were compared with children&#8217;s telomere lengths.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="subject">0604 Genetics</field><field name="subject">School of Biomedical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15226/1/hewakapuge.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the effectiveness of online groups: an investigation of storytelling in the facilitation of online groups</field><field name="creator">Thorpe, Stephen John</field><field name="description">Building relationships in the world of online groups is a recent, exciting and challenging area for the field of group facilitation. Evidence has shown that online groups with strong relationship links are more effective and more resilient than those with without them. Yet, the processes and techniques to effectively facilitate the building of these online relationships are not yet understood and there is scant empirical knowledge to assist practicing group facilitators in this important task. Challenges arise when many of the embodied aspects of inter-personal communication, such as body language, tone of voice, emotions, energy levels and context are not easily readable by group members and facilitators. Many of the well established group processes and interventions that facilitators rely upon in face-to-face situations do not translate effectively or are simply not available in an online group situation. Storytelling, however, presented one approach from the domain of face-to-face group facilitation that might translate well online. Storytelling is well known as an enabler for people to connect at a deeper and an embodied level. It can be highly effective at building strong social ties and group resilience &#8211; right across a wide range of settings. This thesis inquired into storytelling&#8217;s potential for online facilitation practice with the question of how is storytelling beneficial in building relationships in a facilitated online group? Starting with the premise that storytelling will be an effective approach, eighteen facilitators from the International Association of Facilitators (IAF) came together to collectively research the area using a participative approach. The intent of the approach was to involve online facilitation practitioners in the research so that their motivations, ways of looking at things, and questions could have value and that their experiences would be at the heart of the data generated. A variety of online software tools were used including: email, Skype&#8482; conferencing, telephone conferencing, video and web conferencing, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), blogging, online surveys and within the 3-D interactive world of Second Life&#8482;.  The study affirmed that storytelling assisted relationship development across a range of online settings. As anticipated, storytelling aided identity creation; scenario description; describing conflict and to articulate learning edges. The availability of an extra text channel during a primarily oral communication is seen as a potentially valuable contribution to the art of storytelling. In addition, the study offers a challenge to the storytelling field in proposing that direct contact between teller and listener is not always a priori requirement. The blending of roles raises some ethical challenges for online facilitation practice. The also inquiry confirmed that software tool selection was critical for ensuring full participation and buy-in to online group decisions. The 3-D, avatar-based medium of Second Life&#8482; assisted with emotional connections. A range of new opportunities emerged through co-researchers engaging with the research process that inform the practice of group facilitation. They expand the role and horizons of the online facilitator in relation to the wider profession of group facilitation. Reflections are made about the International Association of Facilitators Statement of Values and Code of Ethics for Group Facilitators and IAF Core Competencies and some guidelines for the practice of online facilitation are offered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online</field><field name="subject">Groups</field><field name="subject">Facilitation</field><field name="subject">Storytelling</field><field name="subject">Relationship development</field><field name="subject">Co-operative inquiry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;Sandcastles&#8217; &amp; &#8216;The Postmodern Rules For Family Living&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Fee, Roderick Harold</field><field name="description">The exegesis accompanies a thesis, the latter being the portfolio of work consisting of two parts, each being a completed first draft of a novel written during the Masters of Creative Writing course: Part 1:  &#8216;Sandcastles&#8217; - a 'closed' text novel Part 2:  &#8216;The Postmodern Rules For Family Living&#8217; - an 'open' text novel These two works are separately bound with a thesis cover sheet and numbered.

I contend that the collaborative mode of art production within Tangatarua embodies this dialogical model. I amplify some of the tangible art forms of Tangatarua by dismantling the intangible discursive forms that have impinged on them.

The study was based on Interpretivism and accordingly sought to understand and interpret university teachers&#8217; perceptions and experiences about their teaching of Buddhism; as they engage with the students' learning in this field. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were employed as the primary research method. All seven university teachers who teach Buddhism in New Zealand were invited to be the participants. Six university teachers participated in this research-study. Five of them were academic teachers, respectively teaching at Religious Studies of Massey, Victoria and Otago. Another one was a New Zealand-born Zen teacher who had been teaching a Zen meditation workshop at Auckland University of Technology for several years, and taught two Buddhism-related courses at the University of Auckland. These participants were chosen according to the information provided on official websites of New Zealand universities. The findings from the study showed that the university-level teaching of Buddhism in New Zealand, though growing, had been limited by the number of teachers and students. As fewer students were primarily interested in Buddhism, outward funding support appeared to be a very important factor for its future development. In terms of teachers&#8217; role, objective-outsider remained the main position for scholars and scholar-practitioners in teaching Buddhism in university classroom. In addition to the pursuit of knowledge, there were also alternative educational opportunities, such as Zen workshop, for university staffs and students to learn Buddhism, outside university classroom.

These reference and affirm the symbolism of the carvings but are less visible due to their lesser scale and interstitial placement within the interior architecture. They are rendered more visible through the phenomenological detail of participant accounts as well as the positivism of a formalist critique. I posit art as a dialogical activity, inseparable from the phenomenological conditions that precede and inform it, and inseparable from the emergent meaning that is forged at its encounter. I contend that the collaborative mode of art production within Tangatarua embodies this dialogical model. I amplify some of the tangible art forms of Tangatarua by dismantling the intangible discursive forms that have impinged on them. These include aspects of the political context of the establishment of the marae, Waiariki Institute of Technology&#8217;s bicultural framework, and the pedagogy of its Art School. My writing is underpinned by a participatory paradigm acknowledging my situatedness as an artist participant within Tangatarua, a woman of Ngai Tahu descent, and art tutor at Waiariki Institute of Technology. This study similarly acknowledges the multifaceted, experiential transactions between those artists whose small collective gestures have informed and transformed the interior of Tangatarua.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bicultural art</field><field name="subject">Relational aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Art pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Dialogical meaning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology based personalized modeling for chronic disease risk evaluation and knowledge discovery: an integrated approach</field><field name="creator">Verma, Anju</field><field name="description">Populations are aging and the prevalence of chronic disease, persisting for many years, is increasing. The most common, non-communicable chronic diseases in developed countries are; cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, obesity, arthritis and specific cancers. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity have high prevalence and develop over the course of life due to a number of interrelated factors including genetic predisposition, nutrition and lifestyle. With the development and completion of human genome sequencing, we are able to trace genes responsible for proteins and metabolites that are linked with these diseases. A computerized model focused on organizing knowledge related to genes, nutrition and the three chronic diseases, namely, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity has been developed for the Ontology-Based Personalized Risk Evaluation for Chronic Disease Project. This model is a Prot&#233;g&#233;-based ontological representation which has been developed for entering and linking concepts and data for these three chronic diseases. This model facilitates to identify interrelationships between concepts. The ontological representation provides the framework into which information on individual patients, disease symptoms, gene maps, diet and life history can be input, and risks, profiles, and recommendations derived. Personal genome and health data could provide a guide for designing and building a medical health administration system for taking relevant annual medical tests, e.g. gene expression level changes for health surveillance. One method, called transductive neuro-fuzzy inference system with weighted data normalization is used to evaluate personalized risk of chronic disease. This personalized approach has been used for two different chronic diseases, predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease and predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes. For predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease, the National Nutrition Health Survey 97 data from New Zealand population has been used. This data contains clinical, anthropometric and nutritional variables. For predicting risk of type 2 diabetes, data from the Italian population with clinical and genetic variables has been used. It has been discovered that genes responsible for causing type 2 diabetes are different in male and female samples. A framework to integrate the personalized model and the chronic disease ontology is also developed with the aim of providing support for further discovery through the integration of the ontological representation in order to build an expert system in genes of interest and relevant dietary components.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Knowledge discovery</field><field name="subject">Chronic disease risk evaluation</field><field name="subject">Personalized modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Story telling as koha: consolidating community memories</field><field name="creator">Tanoai, Tuafale</field><field name="description">This project will explore a fusion of Tangata Whenua and Pacific perspectives within a performance installation framework.

This study investigates the causes of truancy for Pasifika students in alternative education in New Zealand. Using a qualitative approach, data were collected using questionnaires and three focus group interviews. The findings from this study suggest that a number of factors affected students&#8217; motivation to study. The behaviour of teachers and the school environment were found to affect the Pasifika students&#8217; approach to learning.

Consistent with the findings in other studies on truancy, this study found that a range of influences such as a lack of support from community leaders, students&#8217; perceptions of their performance, the nature of the classroom environment, family structure, lifestyle factors and cultural and church activities contributed to Pasifika students&#8217; truanting behaviour. This study suggests that schools that employ teachers who understand and empathize with the cultural aspects of Pasifika students and who can empathize with their situation will be most effective in preventing truancy among these students.

The white froth in seawater but not in freshwater is an example of salt-stabilised bubbles. A range of experiments have been carried out to investigate this simple phenomenon, which is not yet understood.&#182;

The process of thin film drainage between two colliding bubbles relates to surface science fields including hydrodynamic flow, surface forces, and interfacial rheology. Bubble coalescence inhibition also stands alongside the better known Hofmeister series as an intriguing example of ion specificity: While some electrolytes inhibit coalescence at around 0.1M, others show no effect. The coalescence inhibition of any single electrolyte depends on the combination of cation and anion present, rather than on any single ion.&#182;

The surfactant-free inhibition of bubble coalescence has been studied in several systems for the first time, including aqueous mixed electrolyte solutions; solutions of biologically relevant non-electrolytes urea and sugars; and electrolyte solutions in nonaqueous solvents methanol, formamide, propylene carbonate and dimethylsulfoxide. Complementary experimental approaches include studies of terminal rise velocities of single bubbles showing that the gas-solution interface is mobile; and measurement of thin film drainage in inhibiting and non-inhibiting electrolyte solution, using the microinterferometric thin film balance technique.&#182;

The consolidation of these experimental approaches shows that inhibiting electrolytes act on the non-equilibrium dynamic processes of thin film drainage and rupture between bubble surfaces &#150; and not via a change in surface forces, or by ion effects on solvent structure. In addition, inhibition is driven by osmotic effects related to solute concentration gradients, and ion charge is not important.&#182;

A new model is presented for electrolyte inhibition of bubble coalescence via changes to surface rheology. It is suggested that thin film stabilisation over a lifetime of seconds, 
is caused by damping of transient deformations of film surfaces on a sub-millisecond timescale. This reduction in surface deformability retards film drainage and delays film rupture. It is proposed that inhibiting electrolyte solutions show a dilational surface viscosity, which in turn is driven by interfacial concentration gradients. Inhibiting electrolytes have two ions that accumulate at the surface or two ions that are surface excluded, while non-inhibiting electrolytes have more evenly distributed interfacial solute. Bubble coalescence is for the first time linked through this ion surface partitioning, to the ion specificity observed at biological interfaces and the wider realm of Hofmeister effects.&#182;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bubbles</field><field name="subject">foam</field><field name="subject">Hofmeister</field><field name="subject">film drainage</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">electrolyte</field><field name="subject">sucrose</field><field name="subject">formamide</field><field name="subject">surface.</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20091117.073007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology based personalized modeling for chronic disease risk evaluation and knowledge discovery: an integrated approach</field><field name="creator">Verma, Anju</field><field name="description">Populations are aging and the prevalence of chronic disease, persisting for many years, is increasing.

The creative work is a young adult fantasy novel, and is part one of what will eventually be a three part series.  At this stage, its working title is Phaze One. The introduction of the exegesis discusses what may possibly be the attraction of the fantasy genre to many writers; especially in light of what some critics refer to as the &#8216;light-weight genre&#8217;, and why fantasy has attracted me.  There is an overview of Phaze One and why I have chosen to write part one of a three part series. The landscape of contemporary young adult fantasy, as well as, the categories of science fiction and fantasy literature and how they overlap will be discussed, with reference to academic literature. I will also discuss the relevance of mythic conventions and archetypes common in fantasy, and how these conventions have been adapted to the novel. Thus, positioning the creative work within its wider context. The exegesis includes reference to various writers who were relevant to the creative process; however, significant reference will be to the young adult fantasy writer Garth Nix and his &#8216;Keys to the Kingdom&#8217; series. Various fantasy elements within the work will be discussed, as well as, the ideas for some settings, and the integration of Campbell&#8217;s &#8216;Heroes Journey&#8217; in the novel.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young adult</field><field name="subject">Fantasy writing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Story telling as koha: consolidating community memories</field><field name="creator">Tanoai, Tuafale</field><field name="description">This project will explore a fusion of Tangata Whenua and Pacific perspectives within a performance installation framework.

in the Australian fixed-price setting</field><field name="creator">Goyen, Michelle</field><field name="description">This research examines the relationship of initial public offer (IPO) underpricing and intrinsic value in the Australian fixed-price setting. The first stage of the research contains a review of major underpricing theories (asymmetric information, institutional explanations and theories of ownership and control) and relates these theories to the Australian institutional setting. A baseline model of underpricing is developed from analysis of Australian empirical IPO literature. The second stage of the research is the disaggregation of underpricing into mispricing (MP) and misvaluation (MV) components. MP captures the extent of the issuer&#8223;s influence on underpricing and is measured as the difference between the intrinsic value of an IPO share and its offer price. MV captures the extent of investors&#8223; influence on underpricing and is measured as the difference between the intrinsic value of an IPO share and its market price at listing.Mispricing is modelled with issuer-related variables that have hypothesised associations with offer price. Results show a proxy for IPO market sentiment and the size of the IPO relative to industry median market capitalisation make significant contributions to the explanation of mispricing. Misvaluation is modelled with investor characteristics that have hypothesised associations with market price. A proxy for general market sentiment and the level of mispricing make significant contributions to the explanation of misvaluation. The third stage of the research integrates results from the disaggregation of underpricing with the baseline model.Several conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, with respect to mispricing, issuers incorporate their knowledge of current IPO market conditions when establishing offer price, with more positive mispricing observed during hot IPO markets. Further, issuers taking relatively larger companies public tend to overprice their issues. This result persists even after controlling for potential scale effects. Second, with respect to misvaluation, overpriced issues (i.e. positive mispricing) are also overvalued by the market. This result provides an indication that price is not a suitable proxy for value. Third, prior Australian research [Cotter, Goyen &amp; Hegarty (2005) and How, Lam &amp; Yeo (2007)] reports a negative association for mispricing and underpricing. Consistent with US results (Zheng, 2007), no relationship isobserved for this sample. Overall, the results from this research indicate that investor-related factors are the primary drivers of underpricing.This research makes eight major contributions to the body of knowledge. The first is the novel approach of disaggregating underpricing into mispricing and misvaluation components. Second, mispricing is modelled and it is demonstrated that previously hypothesised issuer-related factors do not explain mispricing. Third, misvaluation is modelled, providing some interesting insights into the role of market sentiment in the underpricing context. Fourth, the relationships of mispricing, misvaluation and underpricing are investigated. Fifth, the Australian institutional setting is compared to that of the US and implications for future research are identified. Sixth, the baseline model of underpricing consolidates variables developed from prior Australian literature, providing a yardstick for comparison in future underpricing research. Seventh, evidence shows issuers exploit high market sentiment with positive mispricing in the fixed-price setting. The final major contribution relates to the role of institutional investors in the fixed-price setting. Contributions to the IPO literature on ownership and control, signalling, asymmetric information theories of ex ante uncertainty and agency theory are also made with tests of key variables in the mispricing and misvaluation models. Finally, evidence on the role of institutional investors in the fixed-price setting and on the role of demand (informed and total) sheds light on the underpricing puzzle.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">initial</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">offer;</field><field name="subject">underpricing;</field><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">fixed-price</field><field name="subject">setting</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006088/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of automated turf testing equipment for playing surfaces</field><field name="creator">Zeller, Leslie Charles</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Research has shown that a significant percentage of sporting injuries can be attributed to the sporting surface. The most serious of these injuries require surgery, for example, to correct knee ligament damage, a condition which involves expensive procedures and lengthy post-operative rehabilitation. The responsibility for meeting the costs of these injuries is not restricted to the player or the team; there is an unnecessary burden on society in terms of overtaxing an already encumbered health system.A correlation between knee injuries and the traction properties of the sporting surface has been identified by Dr John Orchard, a recognised expert in Australia for sporting injuries. Turf traction referred to in this thesis is a term relating to the shoe and sporting surface interface and reflects the maximum amount of torque a studded sporting shoe can impart on the surface before the integrity of the surface is compromised. Current equipment to measure turf traction properties has limited accuracy and repeatability. This thesis reports the development of a device which measures turf traction with improved accuracy, repeatability and operator safety in comparison with existing commercially-available equipment.The design described in this thesis comprises a rotating ground-engaging &#8216;foot&#8217; driven by a DC motor to provide the required torque for traction measurement, and this torque is continuously monitored using a load cell via an idler sprocket in the drive train. A digital load indicator displays and transmits torque data, and a programmable controller automates the test sequence. A permanently-installed laptop computer analyses, displays and records the traction data. The mechanical design includes a chassis which provides convenient movement across a playing surface and also convenient transport between sporting surfaces.The design automates only those measurement processes that require a high degree of accuracy and repeatability. Non-critical actions are operated manually to maximise simplicity and minimise development costs. Commercially available technology is used wherever possible within the design to eliminate specialist maintenance skills or knowledge. Software was developed to analyse, display and record the traction data and produce a traction profile which is unique for this type of equipment. A full patent has been granted on the device (encompassing function, design and performance) to facilitate commercial development by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries.An evaluation of the accuracy and repeatability of this machine is described and several experiments were undertaken to analyse its ability to compare and differentiate turf species from the traction results. For torque measurements within the expected operating range of 50 to 100 Nm a maximum error of &#177;1.28% has been established.It is demonstrated that the device meets the design objectives of accuracy, repeatability and operational safety. It has been used within a national Horticulture Australia project to determine best practices for sustainable and safe playing surface of Australian Football League sports fields.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sporting</field><field name="subject">injuries;</field><field name="subject">sporting</field><field name="subject">surfaces;</field><field name="subject">turf</field><field name="subject">traction;</field><field name="subject">measurement;</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006175/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art in parallax: painting, place, judgment</field><field name="creator">Akenson, David J.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]The point of this thesis is to undertake a critical engagement with the art and life debate. This debate involves, in particular, the question of the location of art. Does art belong to an autonomous field removed from &#8216;everyday life&#8217;, or is art located amongst the objects and daily activities of our lives? Contributors to this debate usually defend one or the other position; either defending autonomy or arguing that art is, or at least should be, part of life. The debate is located through three historical points: the avant-gardes of the early 20th Century Europe; the neo-avant-garde of North America in the 1950s &#8211; 1970s; and American formalist art and criticism of the 1930s &#8211; 1970s. The thesis then engages the debate through more recent examples of art where the binary art/life is again the principal issue. Minimalism, Installation art, Site-specific art and Wall Painting are examined in the context of the &#8216;end&#8217; of modernist painting. The argument presented by the thesis will be informed by a recently emerging theoretical frame which engages the reception of Kantian and Hegelian forms of aesthetic judgment. This critical context includes the Slovenian philosopher, Slavoj Zizek; the Marxist-Hegelian theory of the German critic, Peter Burger, and the U.S. formalist critic, Clement Greenberg. The positions held by these theorists and critics will be examined through examples of art from both the modern period and more contemporary works. Through this context, the thesis positions the art and life debate within a structural analysis, arguing that art, including objects of ordinary life understood as art, occupy places within an art structure. The thesis argues that the choice between art and life is not so much a positive choice of one or the other, but rather a choice between one and the same thing seen differently; that is, the one thing seen in parallax.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art;</field><field name="subject">life;</field><field name="subject">debate;</field><field name="subject">parallax</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006176/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depression in patients with cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy</field><field name="creator">Beyer, Kathryn</field><field name="description">This simple quantitative research investigated whether patients with cancer developed depression whilst receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, and whether there was a particular time in the treatment cycle that it was likely to develop. A longitudinal survey method was chosen and the instrument of use was the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). The content of this survey include factors that reflect negative attitudes towards self, performance impairment and somatic disturbances as well as general factors of depression. Twenty-six participants were given the BDI-II, and asked to report on side effects that they had experienced every two weeks whilst they were receiving chemotherapy. The study took place in two regional oncology clinics. This report demonstrates that, patients can develop depression whilst receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The study revealed that the 5th fortnight into a patient&#8217;s chemotherapy treatment was a more vulnerable point in their treatment to develop depression. Descriptive analysis illustrated that more females than males suffered depression and that those receiving treatment for breast cancer were more likely to develop depression. Correlation statistics demonstrated a relationship between fatigue and depressive symptoms. There was no statistically significant correlation between the number of side effects experienced by participants and depression. In summary, the findings suggest that patients were more vulnerable to developing depression around the 5th fortnight of their chemotherapy cycle. This research has demonstrated throughout that depression does occur in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and that female patients are more likely to develop depression than males. Due to the small sample size though, the results were not statistically significant. The findings from this research could provide direction for more thorough studies in the future.

Spot blotch and CRR are serious disease constraints to barley production in warmer growing regions of the world, with estimated yield losses ranging from 30-70% from SB and 15-30% for CRR. Although chemical treatments may assist incontrolling spot blotch infections, the most effective and environmentally sound means of control for each disease is breeding for varieties with natural resistance. InAustralia, no commercially available varieties offer resistance to either SB or CRR. This study has sought to establish molecular markers that will be useful for selecting for resistance to each of these important fungal diseases.Barley cultivars derived from the breeding line NDB112 have provided durable SB resistance in the North Dakota region of the USA for over 40 years. The robustnessof this resistance had not been determined under Australian environmental conditions or with those B. sorokiniana pathotypes present within Australia. Toelucidate the genetics of resistance, two seedling and two field trials were conducted on an ND11231-12/VB9524 (ND/VB) doubled haploid (DH) population (180 lines).A molecular map of the ND/VB population was curated in order to provide a firm basis for mapping of resistance loci. Composite interval mapping revealed thatdifferent gene combinations are effective at different stages of plant development. Seedling resistance was found to be conditioned by a major locus on the short arm ofchromosome 7H and this region was validated in the related population ND11231-11/WI2875*17. A minor quantitative locus on chromosome 5HS was detected in one of the two seedling trials. However, this region requires further investigation to confirm its association to SB resistance in this population. Field resistance to SB in adult plants was found to be associated with two major quantitative trait loci (QTL)on chromosomes 7HS and 3HS; and a putative third minor QTL on chromosome 2HS. The 7H region is common between seedling and field resistance and is the most important locus for the expression of resistance at both stages of plant development. These findings largely concur with genetic studies of this trait in tworowed barley germplasm in North American environments.Common root rot is a difficult disease to phenotype for, and breeding programs will benefit from the identification of molecular markers linked to resistance. Data wasprovided from field trials of subsets of the population over four years. Using a novel approach combining the efficiency of bulked-segregant analysis with highthroughputDiversity Arrays Technology markers (BSA-DArT), CRR resistance was found to be conditioned by three putative QTL in an unmapped Delta/Lindwall population. QTL were identified on chromosomes 2HS, 4HS, and 7HS. To validatethe trait-linkage associations between the DArT markers and the CRR QTL,microsatellite (SSR) markers known to map to the regions identified by BSA-DArT were used. The 2H and 4H regions were validated using marker regression of the SSR markers in most seedling trials, whereas the 7H QTL, which is proximal to the location of the SB resistance QTL in the ND/VB population, was detected in only one seedling trial.The QTL identified in this study offer potential to combat the foliar and root diseases causes by this fungal pathogen. The chromosomal location of QTL for SB and CRR resistance have been found to differ in the ND/VB and D/L populations,which suggests that resistance to each disease is independently inherited. Further research is required to confirm the hypothesis that it is possible to combineresistance to both diseases into a single genotype. Such allelic combinations would provide elite germplasm that would benefit barley breeding programs world-wide.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disease;</field><field name="subject">spot</field><field name="subject">blotch;</field><field name="subject">common</field><field name="subject">root</field><field name="subject">rot;</field><field name="subject">barley;</field><field name="subject">natural</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006178/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The theory and practice of managing organisational redesign within a public sector agency</field><field name="creator">Brown, Stephen P.</field><field name="description">This folio explores the theory and practice of managing organisational redesign within a public sector agency&#8212; the 'Out of School Services&#8216; provided by an education jurisdiction, Fraser Cooloola district, within Education Queensland, Australia. The objective of the project and research was to develop and implement an approach to organisational redesign that derived from Limerick et al.&#8216;s (1998) Fourth Blueprint theory (particularly their concept of metastrategy), and to measure the impact of the redesign process on selected organisational operations within the education jurisdiction. In the context of this study, Limerick et al.&#8216;s metastrategic management cycle (1998) is defined as an approach to strategic management that is constituted of four elements&#8212; (a) founding vision (b) identity (c) configuration design and (d) systems of action (Limerick et al. 1998, p 152).The concept of metastrategy is revealed by the research as having clear potential for application in public sector settings. That is, the study captured its successful application to the task of leading a process of organisational redesign within an education system and uncovered complex subtleties of that application. The study also revealed that organisational redesign to bring about sustained cultural change in a public sector setting is difficult, complex and subject to threat by political decisions. In leading and managing the process of organisational design in an educational setting, eleven key leadership skills across three distinct domains - individual leadership capacity and action; conceptual development and organisational implementation - were found to be significant: The leadership skill areas are: (1) developing clarity regarding professional values, the nature of the design task and how a leader might undertake the task; (2) developing a set of options informed by a synthesis of local priorities, the broader organisational direction and relevant, organisational theory; (3) undertaking engaged and purposeful communication aimed at creating greater knowledge of the design or adding value to the intended design and the quality of its implementation; (4) creating a common language as a platform for engaging stakeholders; (5) leading in a manner that encourages creative difference and distinctiveness; (6) displaying a capacity for reflective appraisal; (7) acknowledging pertinent ethical considerations; (8) Identifying, engaging, managing and leading key stakeholders; (9) assessing important leverage points; (10) identifying relevant networks and (11) setting and implementing governance arrangements. These eleven skill areas complement and extend Limerick&#8216;s metastrategic management cycle with its four basic elements of: - founding vision; - identity - configuration design; and - systems of action Each of the above four elements generally align with two of the three domains developed to capture the nature of critical leadership skills required to lead organisational redesign in an educational setting&#8212;inner circle or domain-individual leadership capacity and action and middle circle or domain. The leadership skills captured in the outer domain entitled 'organisational implementation&#8216; extends on the metastrategic cycle by giving focus to the processes that need to be considered when applying the metastrategic management cycle.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">managing</field><field name="subject">organisational</field><field name="subject">redesign;</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">sector</field><field name="subject">agency;</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">jurisdiction</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006180/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the effects of employee and organisational characteristics on two models of employee well-being within an organisational health research framework</field><field name="creator">Burns, Richard A.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Research within clinical, organisational and community contexts, generally equates an individual&#8217;s sense of well-being with the absence of adverse psychological states.More recently, proponents of &#8216;positive psychology&#8217; have drawn attention to positive affective states, like happiness and joy. The focus on affective states relates to a Subjective Well-Being (SWB) approach to well-being. In contrast, a Psychological Well-Being (PWB) approach considers the role of mastery and efficacy beliefs, asense of autonomy and positive relatedness with others, as separate dimensions that are related to SWB. Two studies tested the hypothesis that two affect dimensions ofSWB, Positive (PA) and Negative (NA) Affect, were independently related to PWB.In both studies, factor analysis differentiated between items from two SWB and PWB measures, whilst correlations between the well-being factors were moderate. Apreliminary study reported PWB to be a significant predictor of SWB after controlling for Demographics and Negative Life Events. A lack of association between Negative Life Events and PA suggests independent effects for two broad SWB dimensions. Using an Organisational Health Research Framework (OHRF), a study of high-school teachers further controlled for a five-factor model of personality and both Positive and Negative Organisational Climate. PWB was still identified as a significant predictor of SWB after controlling for demographic, organisational climate and personality variables. Independent effects on positive and negative SWBdimensions were also identified. Assessing change of both dependent and independent variables with two waves of data supported the independence of SWB outcomes and the strong effect of PWB on SWB across time. Higher levels of PWBwere mostly related to better SWB outcomes (lower negative and higher positive SWB states). Although the OHRF proposes reciprocal effects of employee wellbeingand personality on perceptions of climate, the strongest effects were those reported whereby organisational climate and individual characteristics, being mostly independent of each other, strongly predicted employee SWB within and across waves. Implications for future employee well-being research are that organisational interventions need to address reducing negative and improving positive facets of the organisation. Individual interventions which promote PWB components would appear to be a most important avenue by which to improve employee SWB, by reducing NA and improving PA states.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">employee;</field><field name="subject">organisation;</field><field name="subject">employee</field><field name="subject">well-being;</field><field name="subject">organisational</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006182/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A principled approach to criminalistion: when should making and/or distributing visual recordings be criminalised?</field><field name="creator">Burton, Kelley Jean</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Determining the boundaries of the modern criminal law have become a difficult issue, particulary as 21st century criminal law struggles to deal with the widespread use of technology such as digital cameras, mobile phone cameras, video cameras, web cams, the Internet, email and blogosphere, privacy concerns and shifts in modern culture. This thesis discusses making and/or distributing visual recording, and issues which arise with the criminalisation of this conduct. Whilst various national and international jurisdictions have legislated in this regard, their responses have been inconsistent, and this thesis therefore takes a principled approach to examining the criminalisation of such conduct, examining constructs of privacy, harm, morality, culpability, punishment, social welfare and respect for individual autonomy. In framing criminal offences around this conduct, this thesis suggessts that the criminal law should respect the consent of the person visually recorded and consider the subjective culpability of the person making and/or distributing the visual recording.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">criminal</field><field name="subject">law;</field><field name="subject">technology;</field><field name="subject">privacy;</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006183/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational learning strategies for developing strategic capability within Australian Franchised Business Units</field><field name="creator">Cathcart, Malcolm</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Within the Australian marketplace there is often considerable similarity between competing products and services. The need for all firms to develop a competitive advantage in this market is pressing. Franchises are a growing competitive business sector in Australia, with an annual growth rate in excess of 12%. Franchised business units are no different from other firms in that they need to develop a competitive advantage. Within this current fast changing business environment there has not been any research published on how owners and operators within franchised business units in Australia use organisational learning strategies to develop their strategic capability with a view to gaining a competitive advantage. Many firms have adopted traditional training approaches in organisational learning to develop their firm&#8217;s strategic capability believing this strategy to be in line with best practice. This narrow training view of organisational learning involves key employees within a firm identifying skill gaps between where the firm needs to be and the current competencies of their staff. The gap is then bridged by traditional training methods that extend staff competencies to meet the firm&#8217;s requirements. These traditional training approaches separate learning from the work context and have been identified by many researchers over the years as an inefficient practice. This study was undertaken using a case study approach based on semi-structured interviews to gain an understanding on how franchised business units in Australia used a range of organisational learning strategies to develop their strategic capability. People were interviewed from various organisational levels at five major franchises. The study found that strategic capability is enhanced by developing a learning environment that integrated both operational and strategic learning strategies. Based on the research findings, a franchised business unit&#8217;s strategic capability will, in many cases, determine the difference between the franchise&#8217;s performance in the marketplace and that of its competitors, hence, developing organisational learning strategies to gain and apply these capabilities are of a critical importance in a franchised business unit gaining a competitive advantage. The study found a number of key ingredients in organisational learning strategy that built a firm&#8217;s capability. These key ingredients include adopting a work-based learning strategy which incorporates learning activities such as listening and observing others in the workplace; regular internal training; access to external courses; controlled on-the-job training and supporting individuals and groups within their normal work; developing and implementing accredited in-house learning which would include opportunities for staff to develop both operational and strategic levels of learning; formal and informal mentoring for developing the skills of individuals and groups; participation in higher education; and the use of internal state and national franchise conferences as a tool in developing staff and to provide a work environment where empowerment of staff at all levels is encouraged, accepted and supported by the required learning strategies to make it successful. For franchised businesses within Australia aspiring to gain or build on competitive advantage, it is envisaged that the findings of this research will foster the implementation of a combination of organisational learning strategies that encompass both operational and strategic learning, and include learning for both the individual and collective groups.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">australian</field><field name="subject">franchised</field><field name="subject">business;</field><field name="subject">organisation;</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">strategies;</field><field name="subject">strategic</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006185/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical factors affecting trust and technology diffusion within the Queensland beef cattle supply chain</field><field name="creator">Chua, Li Yuen</field><field name="description">[Abstract]The beef cattle industry is one of Australia&#8217;s major agricultural industries and a significant contributor to the nation&#8217;s economy. This research focused on the beef cattle industry in Queensland mainly because it is the nation&#8217;s largest supplier of beef products (Department of Primary Industries &amp; Fisheries 2006c). The Queensland beefcattle supply chain can be described as a system of organizations or people (i.e. cattle producers, beef processors, etc.) involved in the movement of beef products from the source (i.e. farm, abattoirs, etc) to the end consumers. The need for an ever more efficient supply chain in today&#8217;s marketplace highlights the importance of stakeholders&#8217; perceptions on collaboration, which is directly influenced by trust and technologydiffusion. As with any industry, the management of the beef cattle industry comprises of several stakeholder groups, with each having its own set of expectations ofperformance. As such, there is a benefit in studying the factors affecting trust and technology diffusion within the beef cattle supply chain from the viewpoint of thestakeholder groups.In addition to identifying the case study subjects located within the state of Queensland, this research also included stakeholders from Singapore. Studies were undertaken in Singapore because: (a) a study of world beef trends by Chudleigh (2003) highlighted that world beef export growth is no longer confined only to high value markets such as Japan and Korea, instead, the consumption rate in developing countries are on the rise and; (b) as the researcher is from Singapore, it was far more convenient and easier to reach case subjects in Singapore as compared to undertaking a study in the high valuemarkets.This study used Importance-Performance Measurement technique within the theoretical framework. The analysis was used to measure the alignment of a factor or characteristic from the stakeholders&#8217; viewpoint. Information on factor alignment allows for thedevelopment of a strategy process to help balance the challenges associated with the differences between importance and performance for factors affecting trust andtechnology diffusion. Thus, the research question being addressed in this dissertation was: What is the magnitude of the performance gaps of critical factors affecting thelevel of trust and technology diffusion within the Queensland beef cattle supply chain?A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, to incorporate case studies and survey questionnaire, was used in this study. As an initial stage, a comprehensive literature review on stakeholder theory, trust theory and DOI theory was performed. The second stage involved qualitative research using multiple case studies. The final stage involved the analysis of data collected. Independent-samples t-tests andpaired-samples t-tests were undertaken to assess the importance and performance rating of trust and technology diffusion.This research has shown that a gap exists between the levels of trust, as well as the degrees of technology diffusion within the beef cattle supply chain &#8211; there is asignificant difference between the importance and performance rating of both trust and technology diffusion by all three categories i.e. stakeholder groups, stakeholder locations and stakeholder countries. Within each category, the individual groups also noted significant differences between their importance and performance rating of trust and technology diffusion factors. In addition, the research identified there is asignificant difference in the importance and performance rating of quality by the stakeholders from Singapore. Such critical performance gaps (in reference to trust andtechnology) directly influences information flow along the chain, affecting information sharing, and ultimately reducing the level of trust.Further studies extending across Australia can provide a more in-depth understanding and useful insight into the Australian beef cattle culture and also allow for themeasurement and comparison of differing performance gaps of trust and technology diffusion across the various states in Australia. Additionally, as this research onlyincluded participants from Queensland and Singapore, further exploration to include countries not examined in this study can be highly beneficial. Comparison can be madebetween an assortment of countries to address if the factors previously identified with critical gaps are the same or different across countries. This research can also be extended to focus on the size of organization, which contributes significantly to the current knowledge and academic literature on the Australian beef cattle supply chain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trust;</field><field name="subject">technology;</field><field name="subject">diffusion;</field><field name="subject">Queensland;</field><field name="subject">beef</field><field name="subject">cattle;</field><field name="subject">supply</field><field name="subject">chain</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006186/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'A spirit of eclecticism': critical engagements with Australia's innovative new nineties poetries</field><field name="creator">Comerford, Debbie M.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]In the 1990s Australia&#8217;s poetry milieu was enlivened by the emergence of a number of new poets and their poetry. This study groups these poets together under the title of &#8216;new nineties poets and poetries&#8217;. For the purposes of this study &#8216;new nineties poets and poetries&#8217; refers to poetry written for the page by poets who published their first collection between 1990 and 2000 and who continue to write into the twenty-first century. New nineties poets and their poetry are not a new &#8216;movement&#8217; or &#8216;school&#8217; of poets; the poetry is characterised by diverse forms, styles, approaches and practices. Within these eclectic poetic practices emerge shared concerns with the issues of embodiment, language, cultural difference and violence. As John Leonard discusses, the &#8220;new poets evade categorization&#8221; (New Music xv) and it is the premise of this study that appropriate poetry criticism needs to respect and celebrate the eclecticism of new nineties poetries by resisting the convenient application of categories and divisive labels. This study attends to the critical question of what type of poetry criticism is appropriate for new nineties poetries. One answer to this question emanates from what Leonard describes as the &#8220;spirit of eclecticism&#8221; that characterises this new poetry (New Music xv). Criticism that works with this &#8220;spirit of eclecticism&#8221; will be as eclectic as the poetry itself. Antithetical to critical approaches that homogenise poetry with unifying frameworks, this study advocates multiple critical approaches. Working respectfully in relation and in conversation with new nineties poets, the eclectic critical engagements of this thesis are connected by the equally eclectic theories of postmodernism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">poetries;</field><field name="subject">eclecticism;</field><field name="subject">nineties;</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006187/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The association between change styles and job satisfaction among teachers working in international schools</field><field name="creator">Davis, Marie E.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]This research was conducted among the population of teachers working in international schools around the world, focusing on change, job satisfaction and thetransition process. Change style is believed to be an innate aspect of personality, which influences the preferences, attitudes and emotions surrounding change (Musselwhite,2004). Although these change style preferences are manageable and fluid within our lives, knowledge of them can assist in greater self-awareness and professional satisfaction.The purpose of the study was twofold. First, it aimed to determine if an association exists between an individual&#8217;s change style and job satisfaction. Secondly, itaimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cultural, technical and political factors connected with professional satisfaction and the relocation process.The research was guided by an interpretivist lens. An exploratory case study was conducted, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis.Quantitative data collection included a psychometric assessment tool on change styles and a survey questionnaire, completed by 204 respondents. The qualitative element consisted of semi-structured interviews with seven volunteers, identified from thequantitative data set. Communication with participants was conducted through the Internet so as to reach a globally diverse sample of teachers. Qualitative responses wereseparated by themes, which in turn were refined into broader categories, leading to systematic interpretations of change styles among this specific group of internationalteachers. Quantitative data provided descriptive statistics with which to compare qualitative interpretations. Quantitative and qualitative data were compared and contrasted throughout, leading to greater credibility and applicability of the study.The research contributed to existing knowledge in three ways. Methodologically, it demonstrated the value of using mixed data sets in interpretive inquiry. Theoretically, itadded to the existing research into and application of change styles. Empirically, it offered understanding and interpretations of international school employees as theyexperience the relocation process and job satisfaction. Generally, the research contributes to a broader understanding of international school teachers which could enhance professional development opportunities and self-awareness and thereby promote increased levels of job satisfaction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">international</field><field name="subject">schools;</field><field name="subject">styles;</field><field name="subject">job;</field><field name="subject">satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006188/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental economic aspects of river basins and their
catchment. Identification and quantification of flood related land use externalities</field><field name="creator">Dorner, Wolfgang</field><field name="description">[Abstract]This thesis investigates a common problem of land use impacts on flood damage costs on a catchment scale. It does this through a particular case study, to quantify the technical upstream-downstream dependencies and highlights the externalities through hydroeconomicanalysis of flood damages and mitigation costs. The substantive content of the project is cross disciplinary.Peak and volume of river flows are functions of the catchment surface characteristics. This means that any impacts to the run-off regime (for example surface sealing or river training) could affect people and land users in the lower catchment. Thus, upstream activities cancause higher flood peaks, and also entail higher damages downstream. These damages are either borne by the affected parties or they are mitigated by state financed flood defence works or offset with financial compensation. These costs are usually not included in the economic considerations of the upstream land user who is partially causing them. In economic terms, these effects are referred to as unidirectional externalities. This means that a producer can export parts of his production costs to third parties and these are not included in the price of the product.The Herzogbach is a small tributary of the Danube River in Lower Bavaria. It is located in a rural area, dominated by intensive farming practices. Two villages (Bachling and Buchhofen) in the headwaters and middle section of the catchment and one city (Osterhofen) in the lowercatchment were analysed to determine the impact of upstream land use practices on the flood situation.A combination of hydrological and hydraulic modelling provided the core data to allow the interpretation of economic data, using methods of cost damage estimation. A hydrological model of the catchment provided hydrograph simulations based on (a) a regionalisation approach,(b) hydrologic flood routing and (c) hydrologic reservoir routing. A two dimensional stream flow model was then used to convert the hydrographs into flood levels, to simulatethe run-off in settled areas and determine the flood affected areas, flood levels and flow velocities. Estimates for flood damages or mitigation costs resulting from different hydrological scenarios were compared. The scenarios are based on different land uses and alloweconomic externalities to be estimated.It was found that intensive farming and river training increase the peaks, shape and volume of flood waves in comparison to extensive land use, grassland or forest. In the study area, especially river training reduced the detention effect of the river bed and the natural floodplain. These significant changes to the natural run-off regime directly affect land use in the lower catchment through flood damages and increased flood risk, and by reducing the effectiveness of planned or existing flood protection works.The thesis concludes with linked technical and economic findings which indicate a rich potential new area for research - &#8220;hydroeconomics&#8221;. The published literature shows few people have worked in this cross disciplinary area. The technical finding is that changes to land use, especially in agriculture, can increase the flood damages in downstream settlements or increase the cost of flood mitigation works significantly. From an economic point ofview, this is a unidirectional externality which should be considered in catchment and flood management. Possible solutions could include the control of land use and instruments such as separate waste water fees for rainwater and sewage or run-off certificates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environment;</field><field name="subject">economy;</field><field name="subject">river</field><field name="subject">basins;</field><field name="subject">catchment;</field><field name="subject">flood;</field><field name="subject">land;</field><field name="subject">externalities</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006189/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land tenure security and small scale commercial agriculture perfomance in Zimbabwe</field><field name="creator">Dube, Lighton</field><field name="description">[Abstract]The major objective of this study is to identify the effects of land tenure security on Small Scale Commercial agricultural productivity and development inZimbabwe. Using a probit model, the study draws the following conclusions:i. Under a more secure tenure system, farmers are likely to have some longterm investments, in this case in plantation crops.ii. The type of tenure system may not necessarily influence an investment in non-fixed assets like livestock.iii. Secure tenure is likely to influence investment in property improvement fixed assets such as fencing and woodlots.iv. Secure tenure is likely to positively influence an investment in permanent housing facilities but does not seem to influence an investment in associated infrastructure such as garages, workshops or shades.v. Secure tenure seems to be associated with a higher propensity to invest in improving existing farm infrastructure.vi. Freehold tenure system is associated with a higher propensity to access to credit.vii. Tenure security appears not to significantly affect medium term soil improvements. Medium-term and long-term investments on the farm do not seem to have any significant impact on the level of input use.viii.

The study uses the operating theatre of a regional hospital in Toowoomba (Queensland, Australia) as a case study. The theoretical framework for this study comprised socio-technical system theory and coordination theory. From the perspective of socio-technical system theory, each activity within the OTMP has two types of elements: social elements and technical elements. Coordination theory, on the other hand, considers the coordination between various elements of the activities. Time and motion study has been employed to analyse activities in terms of operation, transportation, delay and monitoring within the operating rooms. Subsequently, adapted lean thinking has been employed as an integrating approach to identify preventable delay and disruption within both value added and non-value added activities. Identifying preventable delay within the value added activities inside the operating room is one of the most important contributions of this study. This research uses an exploratory qualitative case study. The focus of this research is to study activities inside the operating rooms, rather than the whole OTMP. Notwithstanding the limited time available to the researcher within a Masters degree, the study sought to establish the direct link of the activities inside the operating rooms with patients&#8216; waiting time. Data were collected from 22 surgery cases through direct observations. In each surgery, the research team followed patient progress from the pre-operative holding area through to discharge. The researcher observed and recorded the timing of all the activities inside the operating rooms. As much detail as possible was observed and recorded to capture sufficient details to allow identification of problems. Moreover, initial observation results were verified and additional information was collected as necessary through communications and interviews with medical staff (surgeons, scrub nurses, technicians etc.) and review of documents. The study indicates that coordination, motion economy, consent form, protocol policy, and surgeon preference sheets were the major areas impacting on preventable delay in the operating theatre suite activities. With the application of lean thinking, the results suggest that preventable delay and disruption within both value added and non-value added activities could be eliminated or minimized through better work organization, motion economy training and better coordination of tasks. For further study, a benchmarking based study could be conducted to see if similar sets of preventable delay are observed in other healthcare institutions.

This, in turn, will help to improve OTMP efficiency and, accordingly, reduce the waiting time of waiting lists.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">operating</field><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">process;</field><field name="subject">lean</field><field name="subject">thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006196/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rare and tragic: Young women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer; a discourse analysis</field><field name="creator">Breaden, Katrina Margaret</field><field name="description">Recent research into advanced breast cancer has suggested that young women in general tend to have more aggressive disease, present at a later stage of disease progression and suffer many more issues and concerns than their older counterparts. Whilst breast cancer in women in general has been the target of a vast amount of research and public attention, values and beliefs surrounding advanced breast cancer have not been a focus of concern. 

The aim of this thesis is to explore scientific journals, the media and to listen to the young women themselves in order to identify the understandings of advanced breast cancer in young women and the ways in which these understandings are perpetuated and sustained over time. The goal is to illuminate the various discourses that are currently being drawn upon to understand this life-limiting illness and the impact these discourses have on the lives of young women concerned.

Poststructuralism is the theoretical perspective within which this thesis is located. This approach allowed for a focus on language, power and text. Discourse analysis of three data sets was used. These data sets were drawn from scientific and medical journals (251), medical texts (5), clinical practice guidelines (2), newspaper articles (230) and transcribed conversations with 12 young women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer. 

The main discourses identified within and across the various data sets were; the discourse of numeracy, the discourse of tragedy and several discourses of the body; the thin body, the declining body, the object body and the gendered body. While the emphasis of each of these discourses varied across the three data sets, they were all present in each to some degree, reflecting broader cultural stories within which the individual stories are located.

Young women diagnosed and living with advanced breast cancer are currently being portrayed as living with a tragic disease, controlled and constrained by the statistics and probabilities and played out within and on a body in &#145;perpetual disintegration&#146;. The discourses of tragedy, numeracy and the thin, object, gendered and declining body all relate to larger stories of what it is to be dying before one&#146;s time in Western society today.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">numeracy</field><field name="subject">tragedy</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">young women</field><field name="subject">advanced breast cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20091023.145507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of sport psychology consultant effectiveness within the consulting relationship</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Lee-Ann</field><field name="description">Within the field of sport psychology the need for effective evaluation is now one of the most pressing requirements, yet it is a need that is often overlooked (Strean, 1998). The evaluation of the individual sport psychology consultant has been neglected in favour of the assessment and evaluation of the methods employed by these individuals. Despite this neglect, the relationship that exists between the sport psychology consultant (SPC) and the athletes they are consulting with is regarded as a significant component in successful sport psychology interventions (Petitpas, Giges &amp; Danish, 1999). Clinical and counselling psychology literatures have demonstrated substantial evidence supporting the positive effect that an open, trusting and collaborative relationship between therapist and client has on therapeutic outcomes (e.g., Horvath, 2006). Yet little is known about the facilitative conditions needed to establish an effective collaborative relationship between the sport psychology consultant and athlete. The first purpose of this research project was to investigate SPCs, elite athletes and coaches' perceptions of the influence of SPC characteristics on the development of athletes' mental skills. The second purpose was to explore the facilitative conditions these individuals believed were necessary for establishing an effective consulting relationship. In order to accomplish these goals, four studies were conducted to assess what SPCs, athletes and coaches believed to be essential for effective consulting. The first study involved the completion of an online Consultant Effectiveness Form by 48 elite athletes; study two involved individual face-to-face interviews with nine elite athletes (6 male and 3 female, mean age = 32.67 years, SD = 11.05, mean competitive experience = 16.67 years, SD = 8.70) from a variety of sports (cricket, rugby, swimming, triathlon, dressage and wheelchair rugby) regarding their opinions of consulting effectiveness. In study three 13 accredited SPCs (9 males and 4 females, mean age = 44.8, SD = 10.6; mean years consulting experience = 11.1, SD = 4.7) were interviewed to examine their perceptions of consulting effectiveness. Finally, study four involved the interviewing of both members of four sport psychology consulting case studies regarding the effectiveness of their individual relationship. An inductive grounded theory approach was employed to analyse the interview data. Following extensive inductive content analysis the concepts and sub-categories that emerged were then organised into broader categories. Results indicated five categories important for an effective consulting relationship; (a) adopt a client-centred consulting approach, in which the SPC demonstrated trust, openness and a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities; (b) transference and countertransference were a reality of the consulting relationship which the SPC should be aware of; (c) an informal, flexible, collaborative relationship with clear boundaries and the SPC being friendly, but not friends with the client; (d) the client contributions to the consulting relationship included commitment, openness and honesty; and (e) the SPC contributed counselling skills, enthusiasm, fitted in with team culture and worked towards creating client independence. The findings provide clear guidelines for consulting practice to promote the development of effective consulting relationships between sport psychology consultants and their clients.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">consultants</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090827.122540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cultural transmission of cookery knowledge : from seventeenth century Britain to twentieth century New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Inglis, Raelene Margaret</field><field name="description">Underpinning most anthropological definitions of culture is the concept of the cultural transmission and diffusion of learned behaviour. Anthropological works generally emphasise the outcomes of this transmission rather than the processes, in part because the mechanisms are either ongoing or practically invisible. Recipes have proved a unique tool for tracking cultural transmission because of their inherent precision and characteristically datable contexts. This study uses recipes to explore the many paths of transmission and diffusion of culinary knowledge. The period under review is from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries and the focus is on British culinary traditions up-to and after, their transfer to New Zealand. It was found that culinary knowledge was disseminated around New Zealand through both formal and informal mechanisms. Formal transmission involved teachers, their school cookery classes and published teaching manuals, all of which played a major role in training school children to cook the dishes served at family meals. In contrast, informal publications such as cookery columns in magazines and newspapers were transmitting recipes for more fashionable dishes, especially baking, and these incorporated mechanisms that promoted innovation more than retention of traditional recipes. The significant role of material culture in cookery provided another pathway of transmission through appliance recipe books which translated established recipes into a form that could be made with the new technology, thereby preventing their disappearance from the culinary repertoires of cooks. It was established that community cookbooks, a common means of fund-raising, were a significant means of diffusing culinary information. The cookbooks produced by such efforts demonstrated change over time in their recipe content, especially if published as a series and such publications were tangible repositories of the cookery knowledge within the community. This study examined not only the pathways of culinary transmission but also the contexts in which it occurred. These circumstances were found to be influential in determining eventual acceptance or rejection of cookery knowledge and recipes, and provide valuable insights into processes of culture change.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food habits</field><field name="subject">cookery</field><field name="subject">community cookbooks</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090828.145727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular identification of membrane transporters associated with secretion in the ileum and colon of the common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="creator">Harfoot, Natalie Ann</field><field name="description">Electrolyte transport in the intestine of the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) differs from that observed in eutherian mammals. This study has used molecular physiology to identify and characterise the expression and distribution of membrane transporters potentially responsible for these differences in electrolyte transport in the possum intestine.
In the possum ileum, secretagogues stimulate an electrogenic Cl&#8315;-independent HCO&#8323;&#8315; secretory response but secretagogue-stimulated Cl&#8315; secretion does not occur in this tissue. Based on the ion dependence and pharmacology of the stimulated secretory response, the expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), pancreatic Na&#8314; HCO&#8323;&#8315; cotransporter (pNBC) and Na&#8314; K&#8314; 2Cl&#8315; cotransporter (NKCC1) were investigated in the ileum. Reverse transcription PCR experiments showed that CFTR, pNBC and NKCC1 mRNA transcripts were expressed in the ileal epithelium. It was then demonstrated by in situ hybridisation that both CFTR and pNBC were localised predominantly in the crypts and the levels of expression decreased along the crypt-villous axis towards the lumen. Significantly, the in situ hybridisation results showed that there were low levels of NKCC1 transcript in the ileal epithelium. Western blot studies confirmed that mature CFTR and pNBC proteins were expressed in the ileum, while NKCC1 protein was not detected. The findings of the present study suggest that the absence of Cl&#8315; secretion in the ileum is because NKCC1 expression is not elevated in the epithelium. The expression of mature CFTR and pNBC protein suggest that these membrane transporters are involved in the stimulated electrogenic HCO&#8323;&#8315; secretory response. The evidence also suggests that CFTR may mediate HCO&#8323;&#8315; efflux in the ileum.
In contrast, secretagogues do not stimulate an electrogenic secretory response in the proximal and distal colon. This study has shown that CFTR, NKCC1 and pNBC proteins are expressed in the proximal and distal colon. Both NKCC1 and pNBC transcripts were localised to the crypt base in the proximal colon. However, it was shown that CFTR has a punctate distribution and the transcript was predominantly observed in the upper crypt and surface cell region. This study indicated that NKCC1 and pNBC were distributed in a different region of the epithelium compared to CFTR. It was concluded that the distribution of these membrane transporters in different regions of the epithelium accounts for the absence of a stimulated electrogenic secretory response in the possum colon. Given that no stimulated electrogenic secretory response is observed in the colon, it is suggested that HCO&#8323;&#8315; secretion by the ileum may have an important physiological role in maintaining an appropriate fluid and pH composition for fermentation in the colonic lumen.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">biological transport</field><field name="subject">ileum</field><field name="subject">colon (anatomy)</field><field name="subject">secretions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090903.143108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The combination of probiotics, 12-monoketocholic acid (bile acid) and gliclazide in a rat model of type 1 diabetes : hypoglycemic effects, pharmacokinetics and transport studies</field><field name="creator">Al-Salami, Hani</field><field name="description">Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disorder characterized by destruction of the pancreatic beta-islet cells leading to complete loss of insulin production. Gliclazide is used in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) to stimulate insulin production but it also has beneficial extrapancreatic effects which make it potentially useful in T1D. In fact, some T2D patients continue to use gliclazide even after their diabetes progresses to T1D since it provides better glycemic control than insulin alone. About 30% of a gliclazide dose undergoes enterohepatic recirculation which may contribute to the observed high interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetics. This may limit its efficacy in T1D especially since diabetes can disturb the gut microbiota and give rise to changes in bile composition and enterohepatic recirculation. Improving the absorption of gliclazide through the use of bile acids and probiotics may reduce this variability and improve the efficacy of gliclazide in T1D. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the interaction between the semisynthetic bile acid, 12-monoketocholic acid (MKC) and gliclazide in terms of pharmacokinetics and hypoglycemic effects in a rat model of T1D with and without probiotic pretreatment. A parallel ex vivo (Ussing chamber) study was carried out to investigate the mechanism of the interaction.
Sensitive LC-MS and HPLC methods (Chapter 2) were developed to determine the concentrations of gliclazide and MKC in Ringer's solution and rat serum. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by intravenous (i.v.) alloxan (30 mg/kg). Rats with blood glucose concentration &gt; 18 mmol/l and serum insulin concentration &lt; 0.04 [mu]g/l, 2-3 days after alloxan injection were considered diabetic. A total of 280 male Wistar rats (Chapter 3) were randomly allocated into 28 groups (n=10) of which 14 were made diabetic. Then 7 groups of healthy and 7 groups of diabetic rats were gavaged with probiotics (10&#8312; CFU/mg, 75 mg/kg) every 12 hours for three days after which single doses of gliclazide (20 mg/kg), MKC (4 mg/kg) or the combination were administered either by tail vein injection (i.v.) or by gavage. The other 14 groups (7 healthy and 7 diabetic) were gavaged with saline every 12 hours for three days and then treated in the same way. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein for 10 hours after the dose and analyzed for blood glucose, serum gliclazide &amp; serum MKC concentrations. Serum concentration-time curves for gliclazide and MKC were used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters.
In the parallel ex vivo study (Chapter 4), 88 rats were randomly divided into 22 groups (n=4 rats per group, 8 chambers per rat), of which 11 groups were made diabetic. Of the 22 groups, 8 groups (4 healthy and 4 diabetic) were pretreated with probiotics as described above to study their influence on gliclazide and MKC flux, 8 groups (4 healthy and 4 diabetic) were used to investigate the interaction between gliclazide and MKC during transport, and 6 groups (3 healthy and 3 diabetic) were used to study the influence of selective inhibitors of the drug transporters Mrp2, Mrp3 and Mdr1 on gliclazide flux. 10 cm piece of the ileum was removed from each rat, the underlying muscle layer and connective tissue removed and the epithelial sheets mounted into Ussing chambers. Gliclazide, MKC or a combination were added to either the mucosal or serosal side and samples collected from both sides for 3 h to determine mucosal-to-serosal absorptive flux (Jss[MtoS]) and serosal-to-mucosal secretory flux (Jss[StoM]) of gliclazide and MKC as appropriate.
In diabetic rats, gliclazide alone had no effect on blood glucose levels (Ch3, exp2) whereas MKC reduced it from 23 &#65533; 3 to 18 &#65533; 3 mmol/l (Ch3, exp3) and the combination of gliclazide and MKC reduced it even further from 24 &#65533; 4 to 16 &#65533; 3 mmol/l (Ch3, exp4). In diabetic rats, probiotic treatment reduced blood glucose by 2-fold (Ch3, exp1) and enhanced the hypoglycemic effect of the combination of gliclazide and MKC (blood glucose decreased from 24 &#65533; 3 to 10 &#65533; 2 mmol/l).
The bioavailability of gliclazide was higher in healthy rats (53.2 &#65533; 6.2%) than in diabetic rats (39.9 &#65533; 6.0%) (Ch3, exp2). In healthy rats, MKC enhanced gliclazide bioavailability (82.7 &#65533; 8.2%) but in diabetic rats MKC had no effect on gliclazide bioavailability (Ch3, exp4). In healthy rats, probiotic pretreatment significantly reduced gliclazide and MKC bioavailabilities (p&lt;0.01) while in diabetic rats, probiotic pretreatment significantly increased the low bioavailability of gliclazide to a level similar to that in healthy rats (Ch3, exp2 &amp; 3). MKC showed clear evidence of enterohepatic recycling and probiotics delayed and reduced its systemic absorption (Ch3, exp3). In ileal tissues from healthy rats, Ussing chamber studies showed gliclazide is most likely a substrate of Mrp2 and Mrp3 (Ch4, exp5) and MKC significantly reduced gliclazide Jss[MtoS] probably through Mrp3 inhibition (Ch4, exp1). In ileal tissue from diabetic rats, MKC had no effect on gliclazide Jss[MtoS] and Jss[StoM] (Ch4, exp2) and none of the inhibitors had any effect of gliclazide flux (Ch4, exp6). This suggests that these transporters are dysfunctional in this model of T1D.
Probiotics and MKC have hypoglycemic effects that appear to be enhanced by gliclazide and all appear to interact at the level of ileal drug transporters. The combination of probiotic treatment, gliclazide and MKC exerted the greatest hypoglycemic effect in T1D rats. Accordingly, the application of this combination may have potential in improving the treatment of T1D.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">probiotics</field><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">bile acids</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">gliclazide</field><field name="subject">hypoglycemic agents</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090903.150030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Halal restaurants in New Zealand : implications for the hospitality and tourism industry</field><field name="creator">Wan-Hassan, Wan Melissa</field><field name="description">Approximately 98% of lamb and sheep, 60% of cattle and 85% of deer in New Zealand are halal slaughtered each year. The high production of halal meat in the country has lead Tourism New Zealand's Chief Executive Officer, George Hickton, to believe that it would be easier to promote New Zealand as a destination for Muslim travellers. However, research has shown that the majority of Muslim travellers find it difficult to obtain halal food in the country.
To understand why the access to halal food is limited for travellers, this study specifically investigates the management and promotion of halal food in restaurants. Data was obtained using a questionnaire that was administered through face-to-face interviews.Since the total population of halal restaurants in New Zealand was unknown, a snowball sampling method was chosen as it was the most efficient and economical way of locating a group of restaurants that was 'hidden'. The locations for sample selection were Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, which have the highest population of Muslims and are also major tourist destinations.
Results, obtained from a sample of 99 halal restaurants, indicate that nearly four out of ten respondents did not agree that the Muslim tourist market is significant to their business. Many were also reluctant to promote their halal food or put up the halal sign in front of their shop. Yet the number of halal restaurants in New Zealand has risen tremendously as a result of the rapidly growing domestic Muslim population. Given the increased risk of fraud, Muslim consumers in New Zealand are in urgent need of halal statutory regulations, as well as stronger guidelines pertaining to the issue of halal food. Additionally, there is also a need to establish and implement an effective halal certification system that is standard throughout the country. The issue of halal slaughter being associated with cruelty to animals will also need to be addressed. Concerted efforts should be made to understand this sentiment and to counter it with appropriate scientific information.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Halal food</field><field name="subject">Halal food industry</field><field name="subject">ethnic restaurants</field><field name="subject">restaurants</field><field name="subject">Muslims</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">dietary laws</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090903.155113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young tourists' perceptions of fear on holiday - a gendered perspective</field><field name="creator">Mura, Paolo</field><field name="description">This thesis explores young tourists' perceptions of fear while they are on holiday. This work is important because it sheds light on tourists' emotional experiences on holiday, adding to our overall understanding of tourist behaviour. While the importance of investigating perceptions of fear has been recognized within a number of different disciplines (e.g. psychology, sociology, criminology, marketing), perceptions of fear have remained relatively unexplored within the tourism experience. This thesis also investigates young tourists' perceptions of fear from a gender perspective. Although gender has been regarded as one of the most important factors influencing perceptions of fear, gendered perceptions of fear among tourists in the holiday environment in general, and young tourists in particular, have received little attention.
The thesis is based on three months of fieldwork conducted in the summer of 2007 on the island of Ios, Greece. The choice of Ios as a study site was based on the fact that the island is promoted as the 'party island of Greece' and attracts many young tourists. Twenty-five in-depth interviews were conducted among young tourists on the island. In order to explore gender-based similarities and differences in the perception and expression of fear, the interviews were conducted with 13 females and 12 males. Systematic observations were also carried out during the fieldwork.
The findings reveal that, although some respondents perceived fear as a negative emotion, others referred to fear as a positive component in the tourism experience. In particular, it was found that while on holiday on Ios young tourists participated in activities that they perceived as risky in order to experience fear. However, only optimal levels of fear were conceived as pleasant. With regard to gendered perceptions of fear, the results show that gender, despite having been traditionally constructed as a binary concept, did not play a major role in influencing young tourists' perceptions of fear on holiday. Rather, with the exception of women's concerns of sexual violence, the findings of this thesis demonstrate that more marked differences occurred in the perception and expression of fear among the various masculinities and femininities than between men and women.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">tourists</field><field name="subject">travelers</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Greece</field><field name="subject">Ios Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090904.110603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innervation of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum of the rat</field><field name="creator">Sizemore, Rachel J</field><field name="description">Cholinergic interneurons are relatively rare neurons in the rat striatum. These sparsely distributed neurons display a synchronous pause in their tonic firing pattern during reward-related learning. It has been hypothesised that a specialised fast-conducting crossed-corticostriatal pathway is involved in synchronising the pause in tonic firing of these interneurons. This study aimed to detail the innervation of cholinergic interneurons by mapping their proximal and distal inputs and to describe the innervation of the crossed-corticostriatal pathway in male Wistar rats. In vivo electrophysiological recording methods were used to label single crossed-corticostriatal neurons but inadequately labeled their axons. Thus, an anterograde neuronal tracing study was conducted. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA; 1.2 [mu]l) was pressure-injected into the left cerebral hemisphere. Six days later, the rat was perfused-fixed and the brain sectioned. BDA-labelled axons were traced to both the ipsilateral and contralateral striata. Cholinergic interneurons in the right striatum were double-immunolabelled using an optimised protocol including a polyclonal rabbit anti-m2-muscarinic receptor antibody and a monoclonal goat anti-choline acetyltransferase antibody. All sections were processed for transmission electron microscopy. Serial ultrathin sections were montaged and distal (from non BDA-labelled tissue) and proximal synapses were each mapped separately. A reconstructed distal dendrite from a cholinergic interneuron, located 225 [mu]m from the soma, was analysed. It had an average width of 1 .25[mu]m and 0.726 synapses per [mu]m. This was compared to dendrites in the same tissue and from BDA-labelled tissue. Two dendrites were presumed to be distal profiles of either cholinergic or somatostatin interneurons, while the third was thought to belong to another interneuronal cell type. In terms of surface area, there were less somal synapses compared to those made onto the distal dendrite of the cholinergic interneuron. Somal synapse counts were similar to those reported previously from our laboratory, where symmetric synapses were most common. Crossed-corticostriatal BDA-labelled axons were found to course across proximal dendrites and somas of immunolabelled cholinergic interneurons. Varicosities from these axons were found in close proximity to proximal dendrites and somas of cholinergic interneurons. Of all cholinergic interneurons in an adjacent section, 77% showed closely associated proximal varicosities. Of these, 76% of varicosities were associated with the soma, 11% to proximal dendrites and 13% to both locations. Twenty-nine BDA-labeled axons were analysed using transmission electron microscopy. Most were observed making asymmetric synaptic contact with unlabelled spines. In two cases spines were traced to medium spiny projection neurons. Two axon segments were seen touching the proximal regions of separate cholinergic interneurons. At these contact sites interrupted membrane thickenings were observed. It is proposed here that synapses may form at these sites during reward-related learning. However labelling of the contact sites with a postsynaptic marker would be necessary to confirm their synaptic nature. The current study has gathered information about the distal and proximal innervation patterns of these neurons and described the termination pattern of the crossed-corticostriatal pathway in relation to these neurons for the first time. These findings support the crossed-corticostriatal pathway as one possible anatomical substrate for synchronising the pause response on both sides of the brain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cholinergic mechanisms</field><field name="subject">interneurons</field><field name="subject">basal ganglia</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090915.155925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metalloid mobility at historic mine and industrial processing sites in the South Island of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Haffert, Laura</field><field name="description">Rocks of the South Island of New Zealand are locally enriched in metalloids, namely arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) and boron (B). Elevated levels of As and Sb can be found in sulphide minerals mostly in association with mesothermal gold deposits, whereas B enrichment occurs in marine influenced coal deposits. The mobility of these metalloids is important because they can be toxic at relatively low levels (e.g. for humans &gt;0.01 mg/L of As). Their mobilisation occurs naturally from background weathering of the bedrock. However, mining and processing of coal and gold deposits, New Zealand's most economically important commodities, can significantly increase metalloid mobility. In particular, historic mines and associated industrial sites are known to generate elevated metalloid levels because of the lack of site remediation upon closure. This work defines and quantifies geological, mining, post-mining and regional processes with respect to metalloid, especially As, mobility.
At the studied historic gold mines, the Blackwater and Bullendale mines, Sb levels in mineralised rocks were generally negligible (&lt;14 ppm) compared to As (up to 10,000 ppm). Thus, Sb concentrations in solids and in water were too low to yield any meaningful information on Sb mobility. In contrast, dissolved As concentrations downstream from mine sites were found to be very high (up to 59 mg/L) (background = 10&#8315;&#65533; mg/L). In addition, very high As concentrations were found in residues (up to 40 wt%) and site substrate (up to 30 wt%) at the Blackwater processing sites (background &lt; 0.05 wt%). Here, roasting of the gold ore converted the orginal As mineral, arsenopyrite, into the mineral arsenolite (As[III] trioxide polymorph) and volatilised the sulphur. The resultant sulphur-defficient chemical system is driven by arsenolite dissolution and differs significantly from mine sites where arsenopyrite is the main As source.
Arsenolite is significantly more soluble than arsenopyrite. In the surficial environment, arsenolite dissolution is limited by kinetics only, which are slow enough to preserve exposed arsenolite over decades in a temperate, wet climate. This process results in surface waters with up to ca. 50 mg/L dissolved As. In reducing conditions, dissolved As concentrations are also controlled by the solubility of arsenolite producing As concentrations up to 330 mg/L.
Field based cathodic stripping voltammetry showed that the As[III]/As[V] redox couple, in particular the oxidation of As[III], has a major control on system pH and Eh. Site acidification is mainly caused by the oxidation of As[III], resulting in a close link between As[V] concentrations and pH. Similarly, a strong correlation between calculated (Nernstian) and measured (electrode) Eh was found in the surface environment, suggesting that the overall Eh of the system is, indeed, defined by the As[III]/As[V] redox couple.
Once the metalloid is mobilised from its original source, its mobility is controlled by at least one of the following attenuation processes: (a) precipitation of secondary metalloid minerals, (b) co-precipitation with - or adsorption to - iron oxyhydroxide (HFO), or (c) dilution with background waters. The precipitation of secondary minerals is most favoured in the case of As due to the relatively low solubility of iron arsenates, especially at low pH (~0.1 mg/L). Observations suggest that scorodite can be the precursor phase to more stable iron arsenates, such as kankite, zykaite, bukovskyite or pharmacosiderite and their stability is mainly controlled by pH, sulphur concentrations and moisture prevalence. Empirical evidence indicates that the sulphur-containing minerals zykaite and bukovskyite have a similar pH dependence to scorodite with solubilities slightly lower than scorodite and kankite. If dissolved As concentrations decline, iron arsenates potentially become unstable. Their dissolution maintains a pH between 2.5 and 3.5. This acidification process is pivotal with respect to As mobility, especially in the absence of other acidification processes, because iron arsenates are several orders of magnitude more soluble in circum-neutral pH regimes (~100 mg/L). From this, it becomes apparent that external pH modifications, for example as part of a remediation scheme, can significantly increase iron arsenate solubility and resultant As mobility. In contrast to As, the precipitation of secondary Sb and B minerals is limited by their high solubilities, which are several orders of magnitude higher than for iron arsenates. Thus, secondary Sb and B minerals are restricted to evaporative waters, from which they can easily re-mobilised during rain events.
Metalloid adsorption to HFO is mainly controlled or limited by the extent of HFO formation, which in turn is governed by the availability of Fe and prevailing Eh-pH conditions. Thus, mineralisation styles and associated geochemical gradients, in particular pyrite abundance, can control the amount of HFO and consequent metalloid attenuation, and these can vary even within the same goldfleld. Furthermore, it was found that there is a mineralogical gradation between ferrihydrite with varying amounts of adsorbed As, amorphous iron arsenates and crystalline iron arsenates, suggesting that the maturity of mine waste is an important factor in As mineralogy.
Once dissolved metalloids enter the hydrosphere, dilution is the main control on metalloid attenuation, which is especially pronounced at the inflow of tributaries. Dilution is, therefore, closely related to the size and frequency of these tributaries, which in turn are controlled by the regional topography and climate. Dilution is a considerably less effective attenuation mechanism and anomalous metalloid concentrations from mining related sites can persist for over 10 km downstream.
The complex and often inter-dependent controls on metalloid mobility mean that management decisions should carefully consider the specific site geochemistry to minimize economic, health and environmental risks that can not be afforded.
On a regional scale, background metalloid flux determines the downstream impact of an anomalous metalloid source upstream. For example, the Bullendale mine is located in a mountainous region, where rapidly eroding slopes expose fresh rock and limit the extent of soil cover and chemical weathering. Consequently, the background As flux is relatively low and As point sources, such as the Bullendale mine, present a significant contribution to the downstream As flux. In contrast, the bedrock at the Blackwater mine has undergone deep chemical weathering, resulting in an increased background mobilisation of As. Thus, the Prohibition mill site discharge, for example, contributes only about 10% to the downstream As flux. This information is relevant to site management decisions because the amount of natural background metalloid mobilisation determines whether site remediation will influence downstream metalloid chemistry on a regional scale.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arsenic</field><field name="subject">antimony</field><field name="subject">boron</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">gold mines and mining</field><field name="subject">coal mines and mining</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090921.144328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese social institutions imitating nature? : an investigation of Chinese-Indonesian entrepreneurs' business strategies - insights from complexity theory</field><field name="creator">Sunaryo, Lenny</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a theoretical foundation explaining the long-standing paradox of Chinese-Indonesian entrepreneurs' highly successful economic behaviour. Combining Western and Eastern philosophies, this study examines the role of culture in prescribing beliefs and practices that affect human efforts to self-actualise, notably the motivations underlying these entrepreneurs' business practices. It applies Aristotle's notion of phronesis (practical knowledge or wisdom) to organisation studies (as suggested by Tsoukas and Cummings, 1997, and Flyvbjerg, 2006). The enquiry employs the concept of self-organising systems (drawn from complexity theory) to ground the Confucian organismic conception of the cosmos (Needham 1956).
The underlying empirical study investigated Chinese entrepreneurs' strategic actions in a particular field (Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia), an environment characterised by complexity, uncertainty and social instability. Primary data was collected through extensive field interviews, developed into narrative case studies and analysed using the explanation building technique (Yin 2003) based on Confucian modelling of social interactions to explain informants' trajectories in their life course.
The findings support the Confucian organismic conception of the cosmos, which emphasises the notions of complexity, continuity, irreversibility and unpredictability. When the future is highly unpredictable, people learn and progress by recourse to learned strategies that were effective in their own adaptive success in the past. Especially when facing tension or instability, the studied entrepreneurs' decision making and strategic actions were spontaneous, without explicit predetermined goals, but based on their pragmatic value judgment, phronesis (practical knowledge) of a situation and the capability of the individual actors within their social networks to control it. When faced with a higher level of instability (especially under extreme constraints), their actions were instinctively revolutionary, often requiring a jump to a new level of network with higher complexity (Holland 1998), returning them to a normal condition. The entrepreneurs' wulun-based social roles and guanxi-based social institutions legitimised all such decisions. Their strategies were therefore contextual and pragmatic, driven by the actors' instinct to enhance the survivability of the individual, family and society.
Chinese culture embraced the natural state of complexity, dynamism and unpredictability of the cosmos by establishing Confucian social institutions, specifically wulun and guanxi, that are learned and practiced from an early age and subsequently internalised as habitual and dispositional practices, including in business. Wulun functions as a social control mechanism for constraining people's behaviour and at the same time allowing people to increase their ability to adapt in order to self-organise in different contexts, whereas guanxi is practiced as a strategy to create a pool of interlocking resources that provides a feedback loop promoting continuous self-actualisation and self-transformation. Identity is associated with progression and transformation; when the self is developed, the family and the larger society are also transformed.
The contribution of this thesis is its integration of Western and Eastern, natural and social, complexity theory and organisation studies concepts to illuminate the relationship between the self-actualising behaviour of entrepreneurs and the cultural context within which they operate.

BB1 that was isolated from brown algae Durvillaea sp. and its partial gene identification, the exo-glucanase (ExoP) has been purified to homogeneity. Full gene identification of exoP was achieved by Southern hybridisation using a derived probe. In total, 7612 bp of the partial Pseudoalteromonas gDNA sequence was obtained, in which 6 coding regions including the full exoP sequence were identified. The exoP gene consists of 2523 nucleotides, which is translated into 840 amino acids. The first 27 amino acids are predicted to be a signal peptide in agreement with obtained N-terminal sequence of native ExoP. The molecular weight of the mature ExoP portion was calculated to be 89320.5 Da (813 amino acids), consistent with its mobility in SDS-PAGE (87 kDa). Interestingly a putative lichenase gene (licA) whose enzymatic function is related to ExoP was located only 50 bp upstream of exoP suggesting these two genes work co-ordinately. ExoP is classified as a glycosyl hydrolase GH3 family member and is homologous with a group of bacterial and plant enzymes of which barley ExoI is the best characterised.
Following the complete gene identification, exoP was successfully cloned, over-expressed in E. coli and purified. Biochemical characterisation of ExoP revealed that the native and recombinant proteins were identical with optimal temperature 30&#65533;C and optimal pH 7.0 for hydrolase activity. ExoP showed substrate specificity towards both 1,3-&#946;- and 1,4-&#946;-glucans but did not hydrolyse aryl substrates unlike other glucosidases in the GH3 family. The ExoP was designated as an exo-1,3/1,4-&#946;-glucanase (EC. 3.2.1-.).
The crystal structure of ExoP was successfully solved at 2.45 A&#778; resolution using a two step molecular replacement procedure. ExoP was found to consist of a distinctive three domain structure: an (&#945;/&#946;)&#8328; barrel domain A, an (&#945;/&#946;)&#8326; sheet domain B and a &#946;-sandwich domain X. The catalytic pocket is formed by domains A and B and this two domain structure is highly similar to that of barley exo-1,3/1,4-&#946;-glucanase ExoI.
Three potential subsites were observed in the structure: the -1 subsite that is identical to that of barley ExoI, the +1 subsite that contains an antiparallel tryptophan clamp formed by W294 and W436, and a putative +2 subsite that involves W494. This observation agreed with the prediction by subsite mapping. The function of domain X remains unknown. However it was discovered that this domain is common in marine bacterial GH3 enzymes, and that marine bacteria also produce an independent protein that consists of the C-terminal half of this domain. The analysis of ExoP structure showed not only the conserved features of the -1 and +1 subsites of GH 3 family enzymes but new insights such as the hinge action between domains A and X, mobility of a flexible loop near the catalytic site and a possible role of domain X contributing to the enzyme fidelity.
The second part of this project focused on glycosynthase activity generated by active site mutation. While ExoP showed no such activity the Glu to Ser mutant of exo-1,3-&#946;-glucanase (Exg) from Candida albicans was functional. Albeit native Exg shows high specificity towards 1,3-&#946;-glucans, using a donor 1-fluoro-&#945;-D-glucose (1FG) and an acceptor p-nitrophenyl &#946;-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) the mutant E292S-Exg glycosynthase preferentially forms a 1,6-&#946;-linked product. In this study, the crystal structure of E292S-Exg complexed with p-nitrophenyl &#946;-gentiobioside (pNPgent), E292S-Exg/pNPgent (the product formed by the above reaction) was solved at 1.60 A&#778;. Comparison of this structure with the previously solved complexed structure, E292S-Exg/1FG/pNPG did not explain why the 1,6-linkage was favoured by this enzyme but surprisingly revealed movement of glucose at the -1 subsite, which is organised by a complex hydrogen bond network, but did not show movement of glucose in the phenylalanine clamp (the +1 subsite). The presence of an aromatic clamp (Phe-Phe in Exg or Trp-Trp as seen in ExoP) in an exo-glucanase is seen to contribute to specificity but not explain it. Glycosynthesis using other acceptor oligosaccharides was also explored in this study. Exg glycosynthase showed broad specificity using p-nitrophenyl derivatised mono-saccharides. However, it remains unknown whether this broad specificity is acceptor dependent or intrinsically due to the mutation created in Exg.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glucans</field><field name="subject">microbiological synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090930.113205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The surface characteristics of spores from thermophilic bacilli isolated from a milk powder production line and their influence on adhesion to surfaces</field><field name="creator">Seale, Richard Brent</field><field name="description">Spores of thermophilic bacilli are a common concern during the manufacture of milk powder. Spores are believed to occur in high numbers in milk powder due to their ability to survive pasteurisation, attach to stainless steel surfaces, germinate, grow as biofilms and subsequently enter the product stream and thereby contaminate the final product.
In this study, thirty one thermophilic bacilli isolates were obtained from a New Zealand milk powder production line and identified as either Anoxybacillus flavithermus or Geobacillus spp. using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and species-specific PCR. Sporulation media and a polyethylene glycol two-phase separation system were modified to produce high yields of spores free from debris.
The spores of four Geobacillus spp. isolates (CGT-8, D4, E7 and E11) were characterised in terms of structure (electron microscopy), surface charge (zeta potential), hydrophobicity (contact angle and microbial adhesion to hexadecane) and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). Spores from three of the four isolates possessed an exosporium while the fourth did not. However the integrity of the exosporium varied over time. The spores were negatively charged (-10 to -20 mV) at neutral pH and high ionic strength (0.1 M KC1). Both hydrophobicity assays revealed that the spores of the four isolates were relatively hydrophilic while ATR-IR revealed the spores' surfaces consisted of protein and polysaccharides.
The influence of these spore characteristics on adhesion to a variety of substrata under high flow rates was examined using the extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. Spores generally attached in higher numbers to hydrophobic surfaces compared to hydrophilic surfaces, however this observation was more prevalent for isolate D4. This result indicated that a single mechanism could not describe the adhesion of spores from different strains.
A series of glass surfaces with modified characteristics were produced in order to test the antifouling properties on the adhesion of D4 spores. Spores suspended in a high ionic strength medium (0.1 M KC1) attached in greater numbers (1 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU cm&#8315;&#65533;) to positively charged and hydrophobic surfaces compared with negatively charged and hydrophilic surfaces. A clean in place (CIP) procedure, reduced spore numbers on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces by 1.5 and by 2.0 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU cm&#8315;&#65533;, respectively. When spores were suspended in milk, there was little difference in the number of spores attaching to the different surfaces (ie. 3.5 to 3.8 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU cm&#8315;&#65533;), and spore removal from surfaces via a CIP regime was unchanged (1.5 to 2.0 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU cm&#8315;&#65533; reduction) compared with spores that attached in simple 1:1 electrolyte media.
The effects of a caustic wash on spore surface characteristics and adhesion was determined. There was a significant reduction in spore viability (2 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU mL&#8315;&#65533;) after a 30 min caustic wash at 65 &#65533;C in the current study, however surviving spores displayed a greater propensity to attach to stainless steel. Surface characterisation results revealed an increase in hydrophobicity and a greater negative charge on the spores' surface after treatment with NaOH. Surviving spores could potentially recontaminate sections of the plant which are cleaned with this recycled caustic wash solution, thereby seeding surfaces with spores at the beginning of the next processing run.
In conclusion, while surfaces that reduce spore adhesion and enhance removal can be produced, exposure to complex solutions such as milk can reduce the anti-fouling effectiveness of such surfaces to spore adhesion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermophilic microorganisms</field><field name="subject">surfaces (technology)</field><field name="subject">dried milk</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">microorganisms</field><field name="subject">adhesion</field><field name="subject">bacterial spores</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091001.131237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Errol Morris and the art of history</field><field name="creator">Fossen, Pamela</field><field name="description">The work of documentary director Errol Morris can be approached in a variety of ways as it intersects and engages with many of the major themes of film and television scholarship - genre, authorship, and historical representation. But while his films and television episodes expose debates within film and documentary studies, they also call up major elements of postmodern debates within the historical discipline. Morris makes historical documentaries that do not simply render a (hi)story visually; he also attempts to draw viewers' attention to the conventions and construction of both visual media and of history. His work reveals both his keen awareness of postmodern historical debates, and a willingness to play, to confront basic assumptions, question boundaries, and to contribute to those debates.
In 'Errol Morris and the Art of History', I argue that Morris is a visual historian; his films and television episodes draw as much from his understanding of historiographical debates as they do from his knowledge and artistic approach to visual media. All of Morris' work challenges the notion of objectivity in both documentary filmmaking and history; he attempts to illuminate the limits and conventions of visual depictions of history; he uses strategies to denaturalise historical and narrative construction, the naturalising tendencies of visual media, and the conventions of documentary practice; and he attempts to promote increased critical reflection. This thesis closely examines Morris' documentary films and television episodes to consider the structure and strategies that characterise his work, and situate it within contemporary film and historical debates. I explore Morris' methods and approach to documentary and history, showing how his work relates to postmodern history debates, to written and visual representations of history, and to documentary history and theory, including more recent factual forms like reality television.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Errol Morris</field><field name="subject">documentary-style films</field><field name="subject">documentary films</field><field name="subject">reality television programs</field><field name="subject">motion pictures and history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091001.154456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeography of the kelp genus Durvillaea (Phaeophyceae: Fucales)</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Ceridwen</field><field name="description">Durvillaea, a kelp genus occurring only in the Southern Hemisphere, presents an ideal system for studies of marine connectivity and postglacial recolonisation. Durvillaea contains five currently-recognised species, four of which are non-buoyant. Whereas all non-buoyant species are restricted to the south-western Pacific, the sole buoyant species (D. antarctica) has a far wider, circumpolar distribution, strongly suggesting that long-distance dispersal in D. antarctica is achieved by rafting. This contrast in predicted dispersal ability among Durvillaea species provides an opportunity for natural phylogeographic comparisons, thereby assessing the effectiveness of rafting as a long-distance dispersal mechanism. Additionally, the inability of D. antarctica to survive in ice-affected areas, combined with its broad distribution, make it an ideal candidate for studies of postglacial recolonisation.
Phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within Durvillaea were here assessed using sequence data from mitochondrial (COI), chloroplast (rbcL) and nuclear (18S) DNA. Genetic data were obtained from more than 500 specimens, including representatives from across the geographic range of each recognised species of Durvillaea. Mitochondrial data for Durvillaea were found to be highly phylogenetically informative, with 117 variable sites observed over a 629 bp fragment of COI. Chloroplast and nuclear markers, on the other hand, showed less variation than COI, but nonetheless contributed useful phylogenetic information. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches.
Contrasting patterns of genetic diversity were observed across the range of D. potatorum in Australia, with genetic homogeneity throughout western sites versus relatively high levels of diversity in eastern populations. Based on these results, I hypothesise that D. potatorum recolonised much of the western part of its range postglacially, perhaps being entirely eliminated from western Tasmania during the last glacial period by altered oceanographic systems. Additionally, 'western' and 'eastern' D. potatorum haplotypes formed deeply-divergent clades, likely reflecting geographic isolation on either side of the Bassian Isthmus during Pleistocene marine regressions.
Substantial genetic diversity was observed across the range of the circumpolar species D. antarctica. Within New Zealand, phylogenetic and morphological analyses of D. antarctica indicate that two morphotypes ('cape' and 'thonged' forms) likely represent reproductively isolated species, with the 'cape' lineage apparently restricted to southern New Zealand. Whereas the 'cape' lineage showed little genetic variation throughout its range, the 'thonged' lineage exhibited marked phylogeographic structure, with high genetic diversity and a clear north - south genetic disjunction delineated by the Canterbury Bight.
On a broader, circumpolar scale, D. antarctica showed contrasting patterns of genetic diversity, with high levels of variation in low-latitude regions (e.g., continental coasts of New Zealand and Chile), versus near-homogeneity at high, subantarctic latitudes. These phylogeographic contrasts strongly suggest that D. antarctica recolonised much of the subantarctic region only recently, most plausibly following extirpation by ice scour at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Locations of putative recolonised islands relative to 'refugial' areas indicate that Antarctic sea ice was likely more extensive at the LGM than previous studies have suggested.
Latitudinal contrasts in genetic diversity were also observed among Chilean populations of D. antarctica, with a single mitochondrial haplotype detected throughout Chilean Patagonia versus high diversity in central Chile (32&#65533;-42&#65533;S). The Patagonian populations appear to have recolonised the region postglacially, following recession of the Patagonian Ice Sheet after the LGM. These populations show transoceanic ancestry, with a closer relationship to populations in the subantarctic and southern New Zealand regions than to those in central Chile. Substantial phylogeographic structure was evident across small spatial scales in central Chile, and the correspondence of major genetic disjunctions among central Chilean sites with the presence of long stretches of unsuitable substrate (beaches) strongly suggests that habitat discontinuity drives genetic isolation in this dispersive species.
Broad-scale molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that the current taxonomy of Durvillaea species requires substantial revision. Previously-recognised 'morphotypes' of Durvillaea (of D. potatorum in Australia, and D. antarctica in New Zealand), for example, were here found to be genetically distinct, likely representing reproductively-isolated species.
This phylogeographic research on Durvillaea kelp sheds new light on the historical impacts of climate change on Southern Hemisphere marine environments, and on the processes driving evolution in a marine macroalga.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fucales</field><field name="subject">kelps</field><field name="subject">brown algae</field><field name="subject">geographical distribution</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Durvillaea</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091002.131226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heritability and phenotypic analysis of high embryonic survival in prolific ewes</field><field name="creator">O'Connell, Anne R</field><field name="description">A significant proportion of potential lambs are lost (commonly 15-20%) between ovulation and day 30 of gestation. Moreover, little is known about factors associated with multiple birth capacity of the uterus which would be necessary to convert gains in ovulation rate to the birth of live lambs. This project has investigated the relationship between maternal uterine and hormonal environment as well as the heritability of embryonic survival (ES) in prolific ewes.
Litter size (LS) from known ovulation rate (OR) records (n=6393) collected over 16 years were analysed for heritability. ASReml analysis reported ES to be a trait of low repeatability (r&#65533; = 0.103) and heritability (h&#65533; = 0.04) which is consistent with earlier studies of this trait. However, pedigrees of outlier animals indicated a segregation pattern consistent with a single autosomal gene with a major affect on enhanced ES. From this flock, closely related high ovulation rate ewes with significantly different litter sizes (High ES; OR2.6/LS2.4 versus Low ES; OR2.9/LS1.6) were selected for further study.
The anatomy and gene expression of the uterus collected at day 14 of the oestrous cycle (n=5 High and n=5 Low ES ewes) and day 16 of gestation (n=14 high and n=10 Low ES ewes) as well as systemic concentrations of hormones indicative of uterine (activin-A, follistatin) and ovarian (inhibin-&#945;, progesterone) function during the oestrous cycle and early gestation were compared.
Progesterone concentrations were found to rise earlier in high ES ewes with a difference in number of ewes with detectable levels of progesterone apparent by day 4 of gestation. The peak concentration and slope of progesterone increase as well as plasma profiles of oestradiol and inhibin-&#945; were not different between groups.
A number of pathways worthy of closer investigation were implicated by microarray analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Pubmatrix, and candidate gene approaches. In particular, the altered expression of many immune cell factors suggests that high ES ewes have maternal gene expression of the inflammatory pathways favourable to embryo implantation.
The plasma concentration of activin, but not follistatin, was found to be significantly higher in low ES ewes, a difference that remained apparent when the concentration of follistatin was corrected for individual samples. Furthermore, the concentration of activin, but not follistatin, was significantly elevated on day 16 of gestation in the uterine fluid of low ES ewes.
Further investigation of the pattern of gene expression during the oestrous cycle and early gestation (day10-16 oestrus and days10-20 gestation) revealed that a significant increase in follistatin mRNA in the luminal epithelia and interacting trophoblast cells of the embryo occurs on day 18 and 20 of gestation. It is likely the appropriate balance between activin and follistatin during the time of implantation enhances embryonic survival in this line of ewes. This may be secondary to or concomitant with the observed earlier rise in progesterone concentration. The implication that embryo survival may be positively influenced by a single autosomal gene has important implications for New Zealand's agricultural industry.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">embryology</field><field name="subject">ewes</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">embryos</field><field name="subject">phenotype</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091009.160105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The association between rated intensity of 6-n-propylthiouracil and three health risk factors in a general population sample</field><field name="creator">McAnally, Helena M</field><field name="description">This thesis explored whether individual differences in taste perception (as measured by the rated intensity of 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP)) were associated with tobacco use, alcohol use and misuse and obesity in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study birth cohort at age 32. This cohort of 1037 participants was assessed at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26 and, most recently, at 32 years, when 96% of the living study members were interviewed.
At age 32, participants rated the intensity of a 0.0032mol/L solution of PROP using the general labelled magnitude scale (gLMS). PROP is almost tasteless to some but tastes bitter to others. As bitter tastes are aversive, due to their association with toxicity, it has been suggested that responses to PROP may reflect individual differences in taste perception that, in turn, have a protective effect on health.
Study One sought to establish correlates of rated PROP intensity in this sample. A model controlling for sex, childhood socio-economic status (SES), childhood IQ and gLMS use predicted approximately 12% of the variability in PROP ratings. This finding highlighted the importance of using appropriate covariates in research attempting to link PROP perception with health risk behaviours, as these factors have also been associated with tobacco use, alcohol use and adiposity.
Study Two did not find that greater perceived intensity from PROP was protective against smoking, as pack years smoked was not associated with PROP rating and ratings between groups of smokers were not significantly different. Differences in PROP perception were not protective against the lifetime smoking in this sample.
Similarly, Study Three found no evidence to suggest that greater intensity from PROP was associated with reduced alcohol misuse. Furthermore, the previously observed association between PROP and yearly alcohol consumption may be better explained by the fact that SES accounts for some of the variance in both measures.
In Study Four, rated PROP intensity was associated with Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference and body fat percentage, in women, but not in men. These associations were weakened after the inclusion of covariates in the models, but remained significant for both BMI and body fat percentage. Findings from Study Four indicate that taste perception may be associated with measures of adiposity in women.
Taken together, these results highlight the importance of using appropriate control variables in research and indicate that a single measure of PROP perception may not adequately reflect the full effect of individual differences in taste perception on tobacco use or alcohol use and misuse. Since PROP perception was associated with differences in adiposity in women, however, individual differences in taste perception may be of public health importance. Future research should use continuous measures of a wider range of taste stimuli, to establish how taste perception (rather than just bitterness perception) affects health. Research should also ensure that covariates associated with tobacco use, alcohol use and misuse and adiposity (such as sex, SES and IQ) are included in analyses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">taste</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">alcoholism</field><field name="subject">tobacco use</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091009.161623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cybercrime and risk for New Zealand organisations</field><field name="creator">Roberts, C. M</field><field name="description">The Internet is now fundamental to the global economy. Growing from an experimental and research network in the late 1960's, it is now the foundation of a wide range of economic, infrastructure support, communication and information sharing activities. In doing so it has also provided a vehicle for cybercrime. Organised cybercrime and state-sponsored malicious cyber activity are predicted to become the predominant cyber threats over the next five to ten years.
Corporate governance is playing an increasingly important role in ensuring compliance with the growing body of legislation and regulation, protecting the interests of stakeholders. At the same time there is a divergence in organisational awareness, understanding, strategy and application between business objectives, risk management and good security practices. Organisations are finding increasing difficulty in managing the scope and extent of the cyber-threat environment, exacerbated by confusion over risk tools, approaches and requirements.
This study provides a pragmatic and practical framework for organisational risk assessment, already proved over several years of use. This is supported by three national surveys which provide important data for sound risk identification and assessments. This survey data is organised through a Data Schema which is simple, rational and flexible enough to accommodate new technologies and types of cyber-attacks, as well as allowing for the decommissioning of technologies and the abandonment of attack methods.
For many organisations this risk framework will be sufficient to meet their corporate governance and risk management requirements. For organisations wishing to refine their approach, a Bayesian model has also been developed, building on previous work, incorporating data from the surveys and, through the Data Schema, allowing the incorporation of probabilities and other evidence to enhance the risk assessment framework.

Ever since 1986, when New Zealand was suspended from the trilateral Security Treaty Between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America (ANZUS), Australia has been New Zealand's closest ally. As a result, the thesis specifically focuses on trans-Tasman defence relations after 1986, with a particular emphasis on attitude trends towards the bilateral defence relationship. Overall, the thesis aims to find out whether there has been a drift in the bilateral defence relationship between Australia and New Zealand since 1986. In this regard, it examines two main questions: first, is the Australian-New Zealand defence relationship is less close today than it was in 1986? The thesis findings show that there has indeed been a visible drift in trans-Tasman defence relations. In both countries, the relationship is much less talked about today than it was in 1986. Second, do Australians and New Zealanders view the bilateral defence relationship any more negatively today than they did in 1986? As the results show, the disagreement over defence spending, New Zealand's decision to restructure the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) as well as the ANZUS split were the main factors that have brought about some distance between both countries' defence policies and priorities. However, beside the downs in the bilateral defence relationship, there have also been ups embodied by the sometimes rather elusive Anzac spirit, the optimism that surrounded the creation of Closer Defence Relations (CDR) in the 1990s and, most notably, enhanced trans-Tasman cooperation in peacekeeping, primarily in the immediate regional neighbourhood. Importantly, Australians and New Zealanders do not see the defence relationship any more negatively today than they did in 1986. Indeed, opinion trends at all societal levels have been remarkably constant over the last two decades. Based on these findings, the thesis concludes that the bilateral defence relationship may well become closer again in the future, especially if both countries continue their close cooperation in regional peacekeeping. This appears to be the most promising way ahead for the Anzac defence relationship in the 21st century.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">military relations</field><field name="subject">military policy</field><field name="subject">public opinion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091105.131723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocean cruising: a study of affirmative deviance</field><field name="creator">j.macbeth@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Modern day ocean voyaging in private sailing vessels dates back to the turn of the century. Despite this, the present thesis is the first academic study of ocean cruising to be completed. Of the thousands of people who make ocean voyages only a few hundred are committed to the lifestyle of cruising, that is, see cruising as a whole way of life that they will pursue indefinitely. The thesis first presents an ethnography of the lifestyle of cruising with particular attention to (1) what activities constitute the lifestyle, (2) why people cruise, and (3) what values, attitudes, and characteristics attach to the participants. Second, the thesis relates this ethnography to several theories in sociology and psychology.

In sociology, subculture and deviance theories are used to place cruising in the context of the wider scholastic study of society. Pearson (1979) and others are drawn upon in placing cruising in the context of subcultures while the work of Walter Buckley (1967) is used to modify deviance theory to account for the apparently positive nature of the deviance inherent in the cruising lifestyle.

In psychology, theories of autotelic rewards, enjoyment, and human satisfaction are used to understand the experience of and motivation to cruise. In addition, theories of personal growth developed by Hampden-Turner (1970) and others are applied to cruisers and their way of life.

The thesis concludes that cruisers, as cultural 'heroes', can be seen as affirmative deviants. That is to say, given an humanistic and western individualistic value system their deviance can be seen as contributing to their individual health and growth, and to positive social evolution.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subcultures</field><field name="subject">sailing</field><field name="subject">ocean sailing</field><field name="subject">yacht crusing</field><field name="subject">deviance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050628.120609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maree Clarke: reflections on creative practice, place and identity</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Maree</field><field name="description">I am connected to the Yorta Yorta, Wamba Wamba, Mutti Mutti and Boonurong people through my heritage. My connection to these four language groups provides the framework for my arts practice research project.  Totems are an important component of my work. Totems govern life in Koori tribal language groups. For example, they dictate who you can talk to and marry, and govern rights for making art, including men's business and women's business. This translates as 'Lore' in Koori culture. Lore is a Koori term meaning a way of being that encompasses kinship systems, responsibilities, and beliefs, as they interconnect with a particular area of country.    In the past, when the Museum acquired Aboriginal artefacts, they sometimes did not record all the details. This meant there was then a break in the knowledge. Aboriginal people have our own collection of artefacts in various cultural institutions, but we do not have that layer of information about what the designs were about.     The totems are not necessarily in the designs on the shields and artefacts. They are generally designs relating to those different areas. Gunnai/Kurnai can be quite different to Latje Latje, for example. Some of the designs on the banners may represent the totems. This can reflect an artist's interpretation of the meanings within such designs.

Cotton fabrics were pretreated with Chitosan and Cibafix ECO respectively, and then dyed with reactive and direct dyes with various amount of salt in a dye bath, to determine the optimum pre-treatment conditions of a reduced salt concentration.       Cotton fabric was dyed with two different classes of reactive dyes and a direct dye with 100%, 75%, 50% and 0% of the recommended amount of salt.  Various methods of pre-treatment application were trialed to determine the most effective and efficient method, as well as to determine the optimum conditions of the pre-treatments.  Exhaustion levels of the dye bath as well as Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels were measured.  Colour strength measurements were also studied along with colourfastness properties.       It was found that cotton fabric pre-treated with Cibafix ECO and dyed with 25% less salt was more effective than fabric pre-treated with Chitosan and dyed with 25% less salt.  Any greater reduction in salt has detrimental effects on the levelness of dyeing.  When using only 75% of the recommended amount of salt, the pre-treated fabrics showed higher extents of exhaustion compared with samples dyed without the pre-treatment.  At optimum pre-treatment conditions a saving of 25% salt usage was observed for cotton dyed with direct and reactive dyes.  In addition these samples also showed moderate to very high fastness properties.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reduced</field><field name="subject">Salt</field><field name="subject">Cotton</field><field name="subject">Fabric</field><field name="subject">Dyeing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091118.122559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring topology and shape   optimisation techniques in underground excavations</field><field name="creator">Ghabraie, Kazem</field><field name="description">Topology optimisation techniques help designers to nd the best layout of   structural members. When followed by shape and sizing optimisation, these   techniques result in far greater savings than shape and sizing optimisation   alone. During the last three decades extensive research has been carried   out in the topology optimisation area. Consequently topology optimisation   techniques have been considerably improved and successfully applied to a   range of physical problems. These techniques are now regarded as invaluable   tools in mechanical, aerostructural and structural design.   In spite of great potential in geomechanical problems, however, the application   of topology optimisation techniques in this eld has not been studied   thoroughly. This thesis explores the state-of-the-art topology and shape optimisation   methods in excavation design. The main problems of concern in   this thesis are to nd the optimum shape of an underground opening and to   optimise the reinforcement distribution around it. To tackle these problems,   new formulations for some topology optimisation techniques are proposed in   this thesis to match the requirements in excavation problems.   Although linear elastic material models have limited applications in excavation   design, these models are used in the rst part of this thesis to   introduce the proposed optimisation technique and to verify it. Simultaneous shape and reinforcement optimisation is considered as well. Using the   proposed optimisation techniques, it is shown that the computational effort   needed for this mixed optimisation problem is almost the same as the effort   required to solve each of shape or reinforcement optimisation problems alone.   In the next part of this thesis, reinforcement optimisation of tunnels in   massive rocks is addressed where the behaviour of the rock mass is in   uenced   by few major discontinuities. Although discontinuities exist in the majority of   rock masses, due to its complexities, optimising the excavations in these types   of rocks has not been considered by any other researcher before. A method for   reinforcement optimisation of tunnels in such rock masses is proposed in this   thesis and its capability is demonstrated by means of numerical examples.   Lastly, shape optimisation of excavations in elasto-plastic soil is addressed.   In this problem the excavation sequence is also taken into account. A stressbased   parameter is dened to evaluate the efficiency of the soil elements   assuming Mohr-Coulomb material model. Some examples are solved to illustrate   and verify the application of the proposed technique.   Being one of the rst theses on the topic, this work concentrates on the   theoretical background and the possibility of applying topology optimisation   techniques in excavation designs. It has been demonstrated that a properly   tailored topology optimisation technique can be applied to nd both the   optimum shape and the optimum reinforcement design of openings. Optimising   the excavations in various types of grounds including elastic homogeneous   rock masses, massive rocks, and elasto-plastic soil and rock media   have been considered. Different objective functions, namely, mean compliance,   oor heave, and tunnel convergence have been selected and successfully minimised using the proposed techniques. The results obtained in this thesis   illustrate that the proposed topology optimisation techniques are very useful   for improving excavation designs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">topology</field><field name="subject">excavation</field><field name="subject">shape optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091118.135631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Novel Carbonaceous Materials Synthesised Using Plasmas</field><field name="creator">Lau, Desmond</field><field name="description">Novel carbon materials such as carbon onions, nanotubes and amorphous carbon (a-C) are technologically important due to their useful properties. Normally synthesised using plasmas, their growth mechanisms are not yet fully understood. For example, the growth mechanism of the high density phase of a-C, tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C), has been a subject of debate ever since its discovery. The growth mechanism of carbon nanostructures such as carbon onions and nanotubes is also not well known. The aim of this thesis is two-fold. Firstly, to provide insight into the growth of carbon films, in particular, the driving force behind the formation of diamond-like bonding in a-C which leads to ta-C. Secondly, to investigate the growth of carbon onions and other sp2 bonded carbon nanostructures such as nanotubes.      To achieve the first aim, carbon thin films were deposited using cathodic arc deposition at a range of ion energies, substrate temperatures and Ar background gas pressures. These films were characterised using electron microscopy techniques to examine their microstructure, density and sp3 content. It was found that the formation of the ta-C is due to a stress-induced transition whereby a critical stress of 6.5&#177;1.5 GPa is needed to change the phase of the film from highly sp2 to highly sp3. Within this region, a preferentially oriented phase with graphitic sheets aligned perpendicular to the substrate surface was found.

The National Packaging Covenant (NPC), which was introduced in 1999, is based on the principle of shared responsibility for the 'life cycle' environmental impacts of packaging. This principle is commonly referred to as 'product stewardship' (PS).   The primary focus of the thesis is corporate environmental policies and practices, but within a broader institutional framework. The institutionalisation of PS as a relatively new framework for corporate behaviour is occurring within an 'organisational field' at several levels. At the broadest (macro) level it is being institutionalised through the interaction of the state, industry associations and environmental non-government organisations (ENGOs) in policy processes. Within the packaging supply chain (meso level) it is being institutionalised through changes to corporate policy and practice within different sectors of the packaging supply chain, including raw material suppliers, packaging manufacturers, product manufacturers (brand owners) and retailers. Within individual firms (micro level) PS is being institutionalised through the interaction of functional groups with different interests, allegiances and stakeholders.   At a macro level the institutionalisation of PS as the solution to the perceived 'packaging problem' is linked to the relative power of the industry coalition in policy negotiations and the deregulatory approach to policy making within federal and state governments. Within this environment, companies have sought to maintain or enhance organisational legitimacy by developing policies and practices that institutionalise PS in the way they do business.    The responsiveness of companies in different industry sectors is evaluated by examining the PS policies and practices of 30 large companies in the Australian packaging supply chain. The results show that companies are acting to reduce the environmental impacts of packaging, but most are only doing the minimum required to meet public expectations. The research also found a significant gap between the performance of the beverage and packaging manufacturers and retailers. This reflects, at least in part, the fact that beverage and packaging manufacturers have a longer history of exposure to interest group pressure on this issue. Decision-making within individual companies is also driven by corporate policies on environmental and social responsibility, which in turn appear to be linked to industry sector, company size and country of origin.    Most companies are focusing on strategies which achieve both environmental and financial savings. This reflects the competitive nature of the industry and the pressure being imposed on companies, by their customers, to reduce supply chain costs. It is also consistent with the voluntary and flexible nature of the NPC, which allows individual companies to choose strategies that support other business objectives. However, while this approach is likely to achieve incremental improvements, it may not meet the expectations of some government agencies and ENGOs for more rapid and substantial reductions in packaging waste. Companies in the packaging supply chain face a continuing challenge to maintain their legitimacy in the face of ongoing stakeholder concerns about their products.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Packaging</field><field name="subject">product stewardship</field><field name="subject">corporate social responsibility</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091119.112425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable Dwelling: A Phenomenography of House, Home and Place</field><field name="creator">Speed, Caroline Leigh</field><field name="description">In Melbourne, Australia, current debates regarding the ongoing provision of suburban residential development to meet housing demand tend to focus on its capacity to contribute to the overall achievement of sustainable development at the metropolitan scale. Within this context, sustainability issues are framed as an environmental problem, and the legislative proposals to address them, in general, are technology focused. However there is growing evidence that deeper changes in human behaviour and understanding are required to achieve a sustainable outcome at the residential scale, and that these 'sustainability issues' are in fact environmental symptoms of a wider human problem.    This thesis presents the results of an investigation of domestic architecture, as experienced by thirteen people, eleven of whom have voluntarily chosen to design, build and live in sustainable houses in and around Melbourne. The respondents' complex, multidimensional lived experiences of house, home, place and sustainability are explored within a framework based on theories of place.    The first of these theories is Heidegger's concept of Being, especially Being-in-the-World, and the way in which this relates to the human experience of place. The second is the related concept of Dwelling, which for Heidegger is the basic character of Being and is intimately connected with building. The third perspective draws heavily from Heidegger's concepts of Being and Dwelling to define place as the experience of rootedness, authenticity, and insidedness, and the absence of these as placelessness. The fourth theory is the genius loci of place, also referred to as the spirit of place. Dwelling is the point of departure for this theory which discusses the way in which architecture concretises the spirit of place, so place may be experienced as an integrated totality. The final theory, articulated by Bachelard, suggests that place, as memory, is the conflation of intimate experience, memory, and imagination. This perspective is explored through the experience of home, especially the memories of home.   Using phenomenography as a research approach, the qualitatively different ways the respondents describe their understanding and experience of house, home, place and sustainability, and the relationships between these, are explored. Insight into these understandings and experiences is achieved through the use of unstructured, in-depth interviews and a purposefully designed mixed-media package (cultural probe) which aims to provoke inspirational, creative and emotional responses. Conclusions are drawn regarding the interplay of notions of house, home and place and sustainability, and the ways in which the relationships between these phenomena influence sustainable behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">house</field><field name="subject">home</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">phenomenography</field><field name="subject">cultural probe</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091119.115312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of local government in the development of youth citizenship : three case studies</field><field name="creator">Stephenson, Peter James</field><field name="description">This study centred on three local governments which claimed to give priority to youth participation. Two of those municipalities were identified on the basis of employing youth participation officers, while the third was volunteered to participate in the study by the Mayor of the day who claimed that " their Council was streets ahead " of other local governments in their response to the issues of young people from within their municipality.         The study was designed to ascertain how the selected Councils engaged with young people and provided opportunities for them to participate fully in the community. I interviewed the key stakeholders of the three municipalities from which I had agreement to participate. During these frank, unstructured interviews, I asked a range of questions about engagement of young people within the community. Each interview was of approximately one hour duration.         Interviewees included elected councillors including the Mayor of each municipality; senior staff within Councils including each Chief Executive Officer; and youth work staff including those described as Youth Participation and Youth Development Officers.         I also examined corporate documents including Annual Reports, Annual Plans, and Council Meeting Minutes from each of the councils under study. These documents provided valuable information about Council priorities, budgets, achievements and future directions.         For another part of the study, I examined back copies of Leader newspapers published in each of the municipalities under study. Using a specially designed data collection form, I collected a range of information about all articles referring to young people, or which had young people as the main focus of the article. Following collection of newspaper data, I entered all of the information into a specially designed template I had previously created in the Statview statistical analysis program. A range of statistical calculations were then performed and frequency tables produced. This part of the study was conducted in response to a claim that newspaper reporting of youth issues in Kimberly was quite generous compared to other municipalities. Such a claim was' not proved to be statistically significant however. Nonetheless, the data showed that contrary to anecdotal evidence and other research related to young people and media, the nature of reporting of young people and their issues in the municipalities unde r study was overwhelmingly positive.         Despite the rhetoric espoused by each local government In relation to youth development within their municipalities, two Councils proved to be disappointing in respect to what they actually delivered. This demonstrated that simply hiring a youth worker and giving them the title of Youth Participation Officer will achieve little if the Council is not serious about youth participation.         For Athena and Burke City Councils, the rhetoric failed to concur with reality. Athena City Council demonstrated few opportunities for young people to participate in community activities and interviews with Athena staff revealed interference from elected representatives, compromising attempts to empower young people. Such interference has been blamed on Councillors trying to hurry a process to see results on the board for political gain.         This study showed that the Council with the least resources and the largest geographical area actually performed far better than the other two municipalities. That particular Council adopted a community development approach to working with young people within the municipality out of necessity. As a municipality comprising a number of towns over a large area, such an approach was the only way that the youth worker could service the community.         Despite individual failings, a major finding of this study is that we can conclude that local government does have a valid role in promoting the full participation of young people within their communities. This includes the involvement of young people in the development of programs and services that best meet their needs and wants. , Further, while the focus of this study was largely on the concept of social citizenship, it became apparent that a broader definition of political citizenship than simply voting or standing for office is as important for the development of young people and their participation in the community, and sometimes indistinguishable from, the concept of social citizenship.         Gleaned from the study is a range of conditions determined as desirable to be present for maximising young people's full participation in their communities. These conditions are more indicative of young people's development opportunities than any of the geographical or demographic traits. These conditions include a stated policy commitment to young people; a professional framework for delivery of programs and services; a holistic approach to the delivery of services, connected to sound planning and coordination; and a supportive elected leadership team that refrains from interfering for political gain. Further, a dedicated council officer with a commitment to positively promoting and empowering young people, and supported by the organisations' policies and practices is essential. That same officer would also require a liberal dose of autonomy and an approach to the development of young people that sees the participation in a process as important as any outcome, and indeed as an outcome in itself.         That local government is seen as key player within the community in relation to youth issues also became apparent from the study. Across Australia, a wide range of programs, activities and approaches were highlighted which relate to aspects of citizenship. This demonstrates an acknowledgement by local government as a sector that youth issues and youth development is no longer an optional extra, but is indeed 'core business'.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth work</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">citizenship</field><field name="subject">social citizenship</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091120.134152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Practice and Progress of Geelong as a Learning City</field><field name="creator">Wong, Shanti Margrietje</field><field name="description">This project aimed to demonstrate that a commitment by a community to improve access to  lifelong learning opportunities as a Learning City enhances the quality of life of its citizens  and improves its economic conditions through a more creative, stable and adaptable  community.           In May 2000, the newly elected Labor Government in Victoria launched the Victorian 'Learning Towns' Program. Based on a United Kingdom (UK) model that had been  developing since 1995 with demonstrable success, the nine (and later, ten) rural and regional  cities and towns in the Victorian pilot program were the first in Australia to receive funding to  support lifelong learning as an approach towards achieving sustainable economic  development and social inclusiveness. This research focused on the practice and progress of SmartGeelong - The Leaming City, one of the pilot programs. It presented an opportunity to evaluate the economic and social development of a community that has declared itself a Learning City by posing the following research questions:           1. What are the key characteristics of a Leaming City and what determines these?           2. What are the value added outcomes? How can the depth and breadth of participation be entrenched?           3. What are the indicators of success and effectiveness in a Leaming City?           Having made this observation however, the capacity for the cultural change in an ACE driven learning community to be sustainable is likely to be limited unless it engages local government in meaningful ways to ensure that those changes are long term. Currently, the contribution by local government to learning communities in Australia is varied and can be erratic. The experience in the UK supports the observation in Australian learning communities that where there is a commitment that is understood by local government, it is possible to improve social inclusion and local economic performance.           This research has concluded that its most significant finding is the effectiveness of the neutral space that a concept such as the Leaming City provides. By providing a conceptual space that  is non threatening, non competitive and belongs to the whole community rather than any one  organisation, it is possible to develop cross sectoral partnerships among organisations that  may be competitors in other environments, that add value to communities, overcome barriers  and develop creative responses that address local issues and build community capacity.           The research describes the experience of building a learning community, of lessons learned and insights gained. Through example, it provides a foundation for other communities that may be interested in pursuing this concept. However, while it is possible to develop a learning community through the commitment and initiative of local leaders, it is made more difficult in the absence of a national policy commitment to lifelong learning. Despite this, the research concludes that through the careful development and nurturing of all partners, the process of developing a learning community is effective, sustainable and makes a positive impact.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult learning</field><field name="subject">Lifelong learning</field><field name="subject">Community Education</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091124.162803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doing more with less? convergence and public interest in the New Zealand news media</field><field name="creator">Walker, Tamara</field><field name="description">The traditional news media is being reshaped by the phenomenon known as media convergence.

It specifically examined the impacts of both individual and collective remittances to the household and community level and on the broader society as a whole.  This study also identified the opportunities brought about by Filipino remittances from New Zealand to communities of origin in the Philippines and possible avenues for the enhancement of the impact of these remittances at the local community level and on society. Case study as a research methodology was used in the study in order to have an in depth, more exhaustive and more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.  It helped captured the emerging themes of remittance practices and development work of Filipinos and their Associations and Organizations in New Zealand to communities of origin in the Philippines.  It also helped understand the phenomenon in the real life context in which a one shot survey or observation failed to capture. The study found that while it was common for overseas Filipinos to send individual remittances to household members in the Philippines for household use and human investments for family members, this was not always the case for Filipinos in New Zealand.  Most Filipino migrants in New Zealand had their immediate family living with them in the host country and they sent individual remittances to the Philippines either as gifts for parents to maintain their livelihood, for investment, and support for the education of nephews and nieces.  With collective remittances, individual Filipinos and their Associations and Organizations in New Zealand were actively contributing in the pooling of resources for development works in communities of origins in the Philippines.  At the same time, they engaged with their recipient communities in the Philippines in order to establish and maintain their transnational ties for effective implementation of development projects in the home country. The study also found that individual remittances coming from New Zealand for family members in the Philippines had a greater impact on the family as a whole.  Remittances helped establish income generating activities in the family that have multiplier effects to the family such as a steady source of income, strong purchasing power and extra money for the health and education of children.  Individual remittances coming from New Zealand to support the family activities in the community also helped the name of the family in the Philippines in a good stead.  On a community level, collective remittances helped maintain culture and tradition as well as raised funds for the implementation of scholarship programs, medical missions, shelter for orphaned children, and basic infrastructures in the community such as school buildings, community roads and multipurpose halls.  Collective remittances also built communities and gave recipients hope for a brighter future through equitable housing scheme, community empowerment, health, and education programs. Filipino Associations and Organizations in New Zealand were good vehicles in finding opportunities in their communities of origin.  They must engaged with Filipino Associations and Organizations and local business people in their local communities and built partnership with them on community based development projects for the benefit of the wider community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Filipino diaspora philanthropy</field><field name="subject">Remittances</field><field name="subject">Filipino migration</field><field name="subject">Community development</field><field name="subject">Gawad Kalinga</field><field name="subject">Public policy</field><field name="subject">Guinsaugon</field><field name="subject">Remittances and development</field><field name="subject">Couples for Christ</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exegesis and screenplay for a film entitled: White Magnolia</field><field name="creator">Hong, Ki Myung</field><field name="description">Most new migrants choose New Zealand as their second home country because New Zealand provides peaceful, safe and relaxed life style and also quality education compared to their homelands.

As migrants adjust to the new culture, their traditional cultural values are increasingly challenged by New Zealand cultural values leading to some degree of personal change. As a result, most immigrants encounter many unfamiliar cultural values in the initial stage of immigration to a New Zealand culture. This story is about the impact of culture-shock on an ordinary Korean migrant family and their struggle adjusting in a new society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Screenplay</field><field name="subject">Drama</field><field name="subject">Immigrants</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Storytelling: circles and straight lines</field><field name="creator">Bronkhorst, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Storytelling: circles and straight lines is a qualitative, retrospective analysis of my thesis (a collection of iconoclastic New Zealand short stories, entitled In Transit), in which I define the scope of my creative work by: positioning my approach within the wider contemporary and literary contexts; explaining its conceptual framework; and describing my intention and process.

Although a wide range of monitoring methods have been investigated and developed, there has been very little migration of these innovations into industrial practice. The principal factor behind this phenomenon is the stochastic nature of the environment in which the system must function. A truly universal application has yet to be developed. The work presented here centres around the application of an unsupervised neural network model to the said problem. These networks learn without the aid of a human teacher or supervisor and learn to organise and re-organise themselves in accordance to the input data. This leads to the network structure reflecting the given input distribution more precisely than a predefined model, which generally follows a decay schedule. The dynamic nature of the process provides an evaluation of the underlying connectivity and topology in the original data space. This makes the network far more capable of capturing details in the target space. These networks have been successfully used in speech recognition applications and various pattern recognition tasks involving very noisy signals. Work is in progress on their application to robotics, process control and telecommunications. The procedure followed here has been to conduct experimental drilling trials using solid carbide drills on a Duplex Stainless Steel workpiece. Duplex Stainless Steel was chosen as a preferred metal for drilling experiments because of this high strength, good resistance to corrosion, low thermal expansion and good fatigue resistance. During the drilling trials, forces on the workpiece along the x, y and z axes were captured in real time and moments of the forces were calculated using these values. These three axial forces, along with their power spectral densities and moments were used as input parameters to the Artificial Neural Network model which followed the Self-Organising Map algorithm to classify this data. After the network was able to adapt itself to classify this real world data, the generated model was tested against a different set of data values captured during the drilling trials. The network was able to correctly identify a worn out drill from a new drill from this previously unseen set of data. This autonomous classification of the drill wear state by the neural network is a step towards creating a &#8220;universal&#8221; application that will eventually be able to predict tool wear in any machining operation without prior training.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SOFM</field><field name="subject">Drill wear</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holding the digital mirror up to nature - a practice-as-research project exploring digital media techniques in live theatre</field><field name="creator">Brannigan, Ross</field><field name="description">Is an actor performing live if that actor is out of sight in the wings and appears on stage as a computer-mediated representation?

and their work</field><field name="creator">Tyler, Mark A.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on research conducted with Technical and Further Education (TAFE) teachers from Queensland and Western Australia. The research is located atthe intersection where teachers&#8217; identities met the discourse of new vocationalism. Scholars have highlighted the tensions that this discourse has produced in therelationships between TAFE and its teachers, and noted that TAFE teachers are pressured to change their subjectivities to reflect themselves more effectively asworkers in an educational market focused on economic imperatives. This is often in contrast to these teachers&#8217; personal notions of themselves as liberal educators, with afocus on lifelong learning, personal transformation, collaborative relationships and social responsibility. This research was driven by the possibility that the concept of &#8216;critical spirit&#8217; might provide a means for TAFE teachers to stand their ground in relation to the continued reshaping of the TAFE teacher terrain produced by the adoption of the new vocational discourse.This interpretative research was conceptualised by synthesising sociocultural perspectives of discourse as a reality building tool (Gee, 2005) with notions of criticalthinker dispositions referred to as critical spirit (Siegel, 1988; Oxman-Michelli, 1992). The elements of critical spirit: openmindedness, independence of mind,wholeheartedness, intellectual responsibility and respect for others (Oxman-Michelli,1992) were used as central components to the development of a coding framework forthe explication of critical spirit from TAFE teacher artefacts and in positioning critical spirit as a discourse. An examination of 12 TAFE teacher case narrative artefacts revealed that elements of critical spirit were evident. Subsequent participantcredibility checks and semi-structured interviews provided diverse data related to teacher embodiment of a critical spirit in relation to the building of certain teacher identities. In some cases participants expressed that their identities were bolstered by engaging in a critical spirit discourse, others cautioned its public embodiment, suggesting that deploying critical spirit made them more visible to surveillance and control. The major finding of this research was that an explicit engagement with acritical spirit discourse was of value to these TAFE teachers. Furthermore, this critical spirit discourse was seen to perform the work of a borderland discourse (Gee, 2005; Alsup, 2006). It afforded a means to traverse the terrain &#8220;between disparate personal and professional subjectivities&#8221; (Alsup, 2006, p. 5).The research also uncovered other discourses pertinent to participant artefacts. These were identified as a test of fortitude discourse and a community of support discourse.It was postulated that these would extend the critical spirit discourse by adding to Oxman-Michelli&#8217;s (1992) five elements of critical spirit. The findings suggested littleevidence to support this position.The significance of this research was in: (a) the production of a methodological construct for explicating particular notions of critical spirit; (b) its contribution to furthering understandings of the professional lives of TAFE teachers and their workworld; and (c) the value that a critical spirit discourse had in strengthening these TAFE teachers&#8217; notions of themselves and their effectiveness. Its contribution tosubstantial knowledge was in its expansion of our understanding of teacher identities within the Vocational Education and Training sector in Australia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TAFE;</field><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">Technical</field><field name="subject">and</field><field name="subject">Further</field><field name="subject">Education;</field><field name="subject">Technical</field><field name="subject">and</field><field name="subject">Further</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">Queensland;</field><field name="subject">Western</field><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">vocationalism</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006204/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second language postgraduate writers in their academic community: links between disciplinary knowledge and writing skills</field><field name="creator">Gomez, Lesvia Patricia Salinas</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Academic standards in higher education require that all students, including L2 students, are able to write fluently, accurately, clearly, and logically. At postgraduate level, students&#8217; competence in written communication depends on appropriate knowledge and use of the discipline-specific genre, plus awareness of the convention-specific phrasing in the discipline. In addition, students need to develop critical thinking and conceptual abilities to satisfy the faculty demands. This research aims to articulate the strong interdependence between disciplinary knowledge and writing skills at postgraduate level. Specifically, this study provides a more explicit description of the role of discourse knowledge and writing skills in academic writing in the business sector. It also provides insights into the skills and challenges of L2 postgraduate writers and their inclusion in their academic community through their writing practice. The two main methods of data collection were: (i) in-depth interviews with students and their course lecturer, and (ii) text analysis of electronic corpora of two written assignments. These methods were chosen (a) to explore students&#8217; perceptions of the writing process and composing strategies in their academic writing production, and (2) to identify key rhetorical components recognising the complexity of the interaction among literacy and disciplinary elements in post-graduate writing. Exploration of the students&#8217; and lecturer&#8217;s perceptions about the students&#8217; writing practices as second language writers indicated students&#8217; experiences, difficulties, worries, weaknesses, strengths and learning processes. Their perceptions clarified the relationship between disciplinary knowledge about Management and Organisational Behaviour and successful writing skills. Findings of this study led researcher to propose two new models: one is based on theoretical principles of academic writing in a discipline and the second addresses specific applications in second language learning and teaching. The first, &#8220;A model for L2 postgraduate writing process: A metadiscourse perspective&#8217;&#8217; identifies the factors involved in the writing process including the metadiscourse of academic writing (Hyland, 1998, 1999a, 2001a, 2004b; Hyland &amp; Tse, 2004a). The second is &#8220;A model of learning academic writing: the second language writing process at post-graduate level&#8221;. This second model involves the stages of knowledge development for a writer in the discipline to be accepted in the academic community. The latter model illustrates the functions, context, the role and relevance of writing within the discourse practices of an academic community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second</field><field name="subject">language;</field><field name="subject">postgraduate</field><field name="subject">writers;</field><field name="subject">academic</field><field name="subject">community;</field><field name="subject">disciplinary</field><field name="subject">knowledge;</field><field name="subject">writing</field><field name="subject">skills</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006220/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accurate and robust algorithms for microarray data classification</field><field name="creator">Hu, Hong</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Microarray data classification is used primarily to predict unseen data using a model built on categorized existing Microarray data. One of the major challenges is that Microarray data contains a large number of genes with a small number of samples. This high dimensionality problem has prevented many existing classification methods from directly dealing with this type of data. Moreover, the small number of samples increases the overfitting problem of Classification, as a result leading to lower accuracy classification performance. Another major challenge is that of the uncertainty of Microarraydata quality. Microarray data contains various levels of noise and quite often high levels of noise, and these data lead to unreliable and low accuracy analysis as well as the high dimensionality problem. Most current classification methods are not robust enough to handle these type of data properly.In our research, accuracy and noise resistance or robustness issues are focused on. Our approach is to design a robust classification method for Microarray data classification.An algorithm, called diversified multiple decision trees (DMDT) is proposed, which makes use of a set of unique trees in the decision committee. The DMDT method has increased the diversity of ensemble committees andtherefore the accuracy performance has been enhanced by avoiding overlapping genes among alternative trees.Some strategies to eliminate noisy data have been looked at. Our method ensures no overlapping genes among alternative trees in an ensemble committee, so a noise gene included in the ensemble committee can affect onetree only; other trees in the committee are not affected at all. This design increases the robustness of Microarray classification in terms of resistance to noise data, and therefore reduces the instability caused by overlapping genes in current ensemble methods.The effectiveness of gene selection methods for improving the performance of Microarray classification methods are also discussed.We conclude that the proposed method DMDT substantially outperforms the other well-known ensemble methods, such as Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests, in terms of accuracy and robustness performance. DMDT is more tolerant to noise than Cascading-and-Sharing trees (CS4), particularywith increasing levels of noise in the data. The results also indicate that some classification methods are insensitive to gene selection while some methodsdepend on particular gene selection methods to improve their performance of classification.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">data</field><field name="subject">classification;accuracy;</field><field name="subject">robustness;</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006221/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using remotely controlled platform to acquire low-altitude imagery for grain crop mapping</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Troy</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Agricultural crops exhibit within-field spatial variation. This variation partly results from relevant bio-physical and environmental factors that influence thecrop during the growing season. The plant integrates the effects of nutrition, water, pests and disease, and displays the results in the foliage. Remote sensing techniques allow the foliage to be monitored and the crop status to be assessed.While the use of conventional remote sensing systems has found many applications in agriculture, it is constrained by a number of issues and problems related to spatial resolution, repeat cycle, minimum area acquired, timeliness of data, etc. Thus, this research explores the potential of developing and assessing low-cost sensing technologies to overcome these limitations. The specificobjectives were to: a) identify, evaluate, and analyse the different options for a low-cost low-altitude (LCLA) remote sensing system that has potential for precision agriculture, b) develop a LCLA remote sensing system that is appropriate for use in mapping selected crop attributes (i.e. grain protein, yield, maturity and crop type), and c) evaluate the accuracy of classification and prediction of the cereal crop attributes.A low-cost sensor system was developed that incorporated two consumer digital still cameras. One camera captured the colour portion of the spectrum, while the other one (with the addition of a band-pass filter) captured the nearinfrared light. Both cameras were modified to be remotely triggered and externally powered. This sensor arrangement utilised 1.0 megapixel cameras in the earlier investigations and then 5.0 megapixel cameras in most recent missions. The sensors were equally well suited to mounting on a remotely controlled aircraft or suspended beneath a helium balloon.Various approaches were taken to determine and evaluate the relationships between imagery and crop attributes. Statistical methods included the use of correlation and discriminant function analysis, along with partial least squares regression. Image analysis techniques included the use of both pixel-based (supervised approach) and object-orientated (multi-resolution segmentation) classifications.The results showed that low-cost low-altitude remote sensing systems (incorporating consumer digital cameras with helium balloons or remotely controlled aircraft) have great capacity to quantify variability in cereal graincrops. Excellent relationships were found between the &#8216;at-harvest&#8217; yield (R2=0.902) and protein content (R2=0.660) of wheat using a single image recorded at flowering. Partial least squares regression, using the crossvalidatedapproach, produced a stronger relationship with a prediction accuracy of 94.2% for yield and 88.5% for protein. This relationship exceeded all other studies reported in the literature.The same LCLA system has also accurately discriminated (using statistical methods) between: a) different nutrition levels in a wheat crop with 75.6% of the cases correctly classified, and b) between different cereal grain species (with differing nutrition levels) with 86.3% accuracy. These classification accuracies are comparable with, or exceeding other more expensive and/or complicated methods. Attempting to discriminate using image analysisprocedures, the pixel-based methods yielded an overall accuracy of 65.9% when classifying cereal grain crop species comprising of nine classes. When merged to six classes, the accuracy improved to 82.1%. Using an objectorientated approach has improved the overall accuracy to 81.0% for the ninecategory classification. This study also demonstrated LCLA&#8217;s ability to assessthe various growth stages of a barley crop prior to maturity with 83.5% of cases correctly classified.This study concluded that it is feasible to accurately assess selected cereal grain crop attributes using low-cost consumer technologies. The accuracies achievedusing this system were comparable with, or exceeded, other reported studies that used more complicated and expensive sampling systems. Further work is needed to continue refining the initial work on a fully autonomous unmannedaerial vehicle (UAV) started in the later part of this study, to extend the use of the LCLA system into broader scale applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remotely</field><field name="subject">controlled</field><field name="subject">platform;</field><field name="subject">imagery;</field><field name="subject">grain</field><field name="subject">crop;</field><field name="subject">mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006222/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The disposition to document: the lived experience of teachers who practice pedagogical documentation - a case of study</field><field name="creator">Kocher, Laurie L. M.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]In recent years there has been a great deal of attention paid in early childhood settings to pedagogical documentation, a practice that has developed in thepreschools of Reggio Emilia, Italy. Following upon the devastation of World War II, educators, parents and children began working in this small city to reconstructtheir society and to build an exemplary system of education for young children. This system has become known as the Reggio Emilia approach. A hallmark of theReggio Emilia approach, pedagogical documentation, is a way of making visible the learning processes by which children and teachers work in early childhood centres.It may include anecdotal observations, children&#8217;s work, photographs, audio and video tape recordings, and children&#8217;s voiced ideas. An integral part of thedocumentation is the teacher&#8217;s reflective commentary. Pedagogical documentation can also be a focus for linking theory and practice.This qualitative instrumental case study involved looking at the personal qualities that have enabled three particular teachers located at an early childhoodcentre in Seattle, U.S.A., to embrace with enthusiasm the practice of pedagogical documentation. What are the lived experiences of these teachers? Do these teachers demonstrate particular attributes that foster  &#8220;disposition to document&#8221;?Three teachers, along with two of the school&#8217;s parents, participated in a series of interviews which were analysed for significant themes. Subsequent conversations with the participants confirmed the initial themes I had drawn fromthe interview data.A relationship of reciprocity emerged - working with pedagogical documentation fostered dispositions that each teacher already had, while at the same time, these teachers were drawn to the Reggio Emilia approach because it resonated with them in an intuitive way. Pedagogical documentation demands a high level of intellectual commitment and a passionate engagement with one&#8217;steaching.

The degree of crop damage depends on seasonal conditions. Typically, high moisture conditions early in the season encourage seedling infection from stubble residues. Moisture stress later in the season leads to the production of unfilled &#8220;whiteheads&#8221;. Current control relies on cultural practices and sowing of partially resistant varieties. In order to understand the nature of partial resistance, I have examined the patterns of disease symptom development and pathogen spread in susceptible and partially resistant tissues of both pot-grown wheat, barley and oat seedlings and field-grown inoculated wheat trials. Further research was conducted to determine whether differences in pathogenicity occur amongst a small subset of Australian Fpg isolates. Seedling experiments confirmed that differences in disease ratings between susceptible and partially resistant genotypes are detected in younger leaf sheaths of older seedlings. At later harvest times differences between these genotypes are not significant in older leaf sheaths. Re-isolation of Fpg from inoculated seedlings has shown that each tissue was infected later in partially resistant genotypes compared to susceptible ones with a significantly lower number of isolations recorded at each harvest time in 42 day old seedlings. Barley cultivars were rapidly infected by the pathogen and exhibited high levels of disease symptoms. By comparison levels of infection in oats were low compared to all other genotypes. No significant differences between genotypes were observed in coleoptile tissues, either in fungal colonisation or development of disease symptoms. Disease development in the subcrown internode varied between lines/cultivars but was not representative of the relative susceptibility of each genotype. The pathogen did not appear to invade plant tissue via the vascular system but rather spread directly across the stem from leaf sheath to leaf sheath. Field trials were designed to study disease symptom development and localisation of Fpg hyphae in all expanded tissues (excluding head and roots) in wheat genotypes of known susceptibility to crown rot. Plants were harvested at approximately fortnightly intervals throughout the growing season. The main effects and interactions of harvest, genotype and tiller on each plant part were examined with a detailed statistical analysis of differences seen in these factors between susceptible and partially resistant wheat genotypes, in two inoculated field trials. While differences between genotypes were mostly not significant at each harvest when disease rating or isolations from leaf sheath tissues were examined, important differences between susceptible and resistant genotypes were seen in disease developments and Fpg infections of stem tissue in field trials. Restriction of pathogen growth and symptom development was more pronounced in the tissues of 2-49 (possesses seedling resistance) than in the field resistant Sunco. At present, the mechanisms that lead to these resistance responses are unknown. The pathogenicity study aimed to determine whether 7 Fpg isolates and a mixed inoculum differed in ability to cause crown rot in 9 wheat genotypes ranging in susceptibility to this disease. Although a genotype*inoculum interaction was significant, there is no evidence of stable pathogenic races in the isolates examined in these experiments. The growth of all isolates was partially inhibited in a consistent manner on resistant genotypes when compared to very susceptible genotypes. These results confirm significant differences in the aggressiveness of Fpg isolates on wheat, evidenced by variation in mean disease severity between isolates growing on a range of host genotypes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crown</field><field name="subject">rot;</field><field name="subject">disease;</field><field name="subject">crop;</field><field name="subject">seedling</field><field name="subject">infection</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006225/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meshless radial basis function method for unsteady incompressible viscous flows</field><field name="creator">Mai-Cao, Lan</field><field name="description">[Abstract]This thesis reports the development of new meshless schemes for solving timedependent partial differential equations (PDEs) and for the numerical simulation of some typical unsteady incompressible viscous flows.The new numerical schemes are based on the Idirect/Integrated Radial Basis Function Network (IRBFN) method which is fully meshless as no element-typemesh is required. The IRBFN method has been successfully applied to solve time-independent elliptic PDEs, some steady fluid flows and recently unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in streamfunction-vorticiy formulation using simple time integration methods (e.g. first-order backward Euler method). The main objective of the present research is to devise and implement meshless numerical schemes for unsteady problems in computational fluid dynamics where notonly the accuracy but also the efficiency and stability of the numerical schemes are of primary concerns. In addition, the effects of different parameters of theIRBFN method on the accuracy, stability and efficiency of the proposed numerical schemes are extensively studied in this research.As the first step in extending the IRBFN method to various types of timedependent PDEs, two numerical schemes combining the IRBFN method with high-order time stepping algorithms are developed for solving parabolic, hyperbolic,and advection-diffusion equations. Sensitivity analysis of the method to point density, time-step size and shape parameter are extensively performed to study the influence of these parameters to the overall accuracy of the method.A further extension of the IRBFN method for incompressible fluid flows with moving interfaces, especially for passive transport problems is accomplished in this research with a novel meshless approach in which the level set methodis coupled with the the IRBFN method for capturing moving interfaces in an ambient fluid flow without any explicit computation of the actual front location.Another contribution of this research is the development of two new meshless schemes based on the IRBFN method for the numerical simulation of unsteady incompressible viscous flows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. In the new schemes, the splitting approach is used to deal with the momentum equation and the incompressibility constraint in a segregated manner. Numerical experiments on the new schemes in terms of accuracy and stability are performed for verification purposes.Finally, a novel meshless hybrid scheme is developed in this research to numerically simulate interfacial flows in which the motion and deformation of the interface between the two immiscible fluids are fully captured. Unlike the passive transport problems mentioned above where the influence of the moving interface on the surrounding fluid is ignored, the interfacial flows are studied here with the surface tension taken into account. As a result, a two-way interaction between the moving interface and the ambient flow is fully investigated.All numerical schemes developed in this research are verified through a wide range of transient problems including different kinds of time-dependent PDEs,typical passive transport problems and interfacial flows as well as unsteady incompressible viscous flows governed by Navier-Stokes equations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meshless</field><field name="subject">schemes;</field><field name="subject">unsteady</field><field name="subject">fluid</field><field name="subject">flows;</field><field name="subject">computational</field><field name="subject">fluid</field><field name="subject">dynamics;</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">schemes</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006227/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic non-destructive dimensional measurement of cotton plants in real-time by machine vision</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Cheryl</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Pressure on water resources in Australia necessitates improved application of water to irrigated crops. Cotton is one of Australia&#8217;s major crops, but is also a large water user. On-farm water savings can be achieved by irrigating via large mobile irrigationmachines (LMIMs), which are capable of implementing deficit strategies and varying water application to 1 m2 resolution. However, irrigation amounts are commonly heldconstant throughout a field despite differing water requirements for different areas of a crop due to spatial variability of soil, microclimate and crop properties.This research has developed a non-destructive cotton plant dimensional measurement system, capable of mounting on a LMIM and streaming live crop measurement data toa variable-rate irrigation controller. The sensor is a vision system that measures the cotton plant attribute of internode length, i.e. the distance between main stem nodes(or branch junctions) on the plant&#8217;s main stem, which is a significant indicator of plant water stress.The vision system consisted of a Sony camcorder deinterlaced image size 720 &#215; 288 pixels) mounted behind a transparent panel that moved continuously through the cropcanopy. The camera and transparent panel were embodied in a contoured fibreglass camera enclosure (dimensions 535 mm &#215; 555 mm &#215; 270 mm wide) that utilised the natural flexibility of the growing foliage to firstly contact the plant, such that the top five nodes of the plant were in front of the transparent panel, and then smoothly andnon-destructively guide the plant under the curved bottom surface of the enclosure. By forcing the plant into a fixed object plane (the transparent panel), reliable geometric measurement was possible without the use of stereo vision. Motorisation of the camera enclosure enabled conveyance both across and along the crop rows using an in-field chassis.A custom image processing algorithm was developed to automatically extract internode distance from the images collected by the camera, and comprised both single frameand sequential-frame analyses. Single frame processing consisted of detecting lines corresponding to branches and calculating the intersection of the detected lines with themain stem to estimate candidate node positions. Calculation of the &#8216;vesselness&#8217; function for each pixel using the Hessian matrix eigenvalues determined whether the pixel was likely to belong to a stem (i.e. a curvilinear structure). Large areas of connectedhigh-vesselness pixels were identified as branches. For each branch area, centre points were determined by solving the second order Taylor polynomial in the direction perpendicular to the line direction. The main stem was estimated with a linear Hough transform on the branch centre points within the image. Lines were then fitted to the centre points of other branch segments using the hop-along line-fitting algorithm and these lines were selectively projected to the main stem to estimate candidate node positions. The automatically-identified node positions corresponded to manual positionmeasurements made on the source images.Within individual images, leaf edges were erroneously detected as candidate nodes (&#8216;false positives&#8217;) and contributed up to 22% of the total number of detected candidate nodes. However, a grouping algorithm based on a Delaunay Triangulation mesh of the candidate node positions was used to remove the largely-random false positives and to create accurate candidate node trajectories. The internode distance measurementwas then calculated as the maximum value between detected trajectories which corresponded to when the plant was closest to the transparent panel.From 168 video sequences of fourteen plants, 95 internode lengths were automatically detected at an average rate of one internode length per 1.75 plants for across row measurement,and one internode length per 3.3 m for along row measurement. Comparison with manually-measured internode lengths yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.86 for the automatic measurements and an average standard error in measurement of 3.0 mm with almost zero measurement bias.The second and third internode distances were most commonly detected by the vision system. The most measurements were obtained with the camera facing north orsouth, on a partially cloudy day in which the sunlight was diffused. Heliotropic effects and overexposed image background reduced image quality when the camera faced eastor west. Night time images, captured with 850 nm LED illumination, provided as many measurements as the corresponding daytime measurements. Along row cameraenclosure speeds up to 0.20 m/s yielded internode lengths using the current image processing algorithms and hardware. Calculations based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation indicated an overall algorithm run-time of 46 ms per frame which is suitable for real-time application.It is concluded that field measurement of cotton plant internode length is possible using a moving, plant-contacting camera enclosure; that the presence of occlusions and other foliage edges can be overcome by analysing the sequence of images; and that real-timein-field operation is achievable.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">irrigation;</field><field name="subject">crop;</field><field name="subject">cotton;</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">system;</field><field name="subject">machine</field><field name="subject">vision;</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006228/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Yumi pedagogy: pedagogy with cultural integrity in the Torres Strait</field><field name="creator">McMaster, John</field><field name="description">[The Mariner's Chart]I've chosen to use the metaphor of the mariners chart to highlight the characteristics that are the essential elements of this study. This metaphor also sits comfortably with the Torres Strait Islander people, both historically and contemporaneously. The document '(IN) THE BEGINNING: The mariner&#8217;s chart to the folio&#8217;, represents the chart which enables readers ofthis study to 'navigate' their individual progress through the study in ways that reflect the reader's motivation/s. As with most maritime voyages, destinations can be reached via a number of different routes. These routes will be partially determined by motivations including tides, winds, directness, the skill of the navigator and the whim of the skipper. These motivations also apply to any reading of this study. The essential starting point will bedetermined initially by reference to the chart. Being made aware of the elements of the folio (logs of the various voyages) will influence where the reader goes from there; in other words, what folio elements (logs of the voyages) the reader will go to first and the order they chooseto follow, subsequent to that. There is no necessary order in which the logs of the various voyages should be read, following the initial reference to the 'chart'.The mariner's chart identifies low water marks, channel markers, reefs, sandbanks, and unseen obstacles. These represent only a handful of the dangers the reader (mariner) will face on the voyage. Likewise the study has its share of 'dangers', both seen and unseen. Thewhole nature of the study is in a sense, dangerous. I anticipate that any reading of the study will necessarily reflect the idiosyncrasies of the reader, so that the conclusions that I have reached, represent only one view of the data. The identification of the data itself reflects a level of interpretation that is also very personal, highlighting the reality that others(readers/mariners) may see greater significance in aspects of the recorded data that the author has not. The log of the voyage, My Journey An Autobiographical Narrative, clearly identifies a very personal journey or series of journeys, all of which reflect a range of reefs and sandbars that the author has sometimes been stranded on, between tides, giving time for reflection on actions that have either proven unsuccessful or are cause for quietcontemplation. Each of the folio elements reflects this metaphoric mix of danger and clear passage, in many different ways and at many different levels, inviting the individual and equally legitimate reactions of each reader.Whilst Torres Strait Islanders historically navigated by the stars and the seasons today, electronic navigation charts have tended to replace these important and culturally significant practices. Torres Strait people have metaphorically experienced being stranded on reefs andshoals and being wrecked, especially in terms of the education processes they have been exposed to, by virtue of this cultural shift. The process, educationally, of replacing the reliable historic (navigation) practices of Torres Strait Islanders with contemporary, western(navigation charts) practices has frequently resulted in confusion, frustration and a failure to produce successful educational outcomes for Torres Strait Islanders - clear passage to the future. The reasons for this situation are explored in greater depth in this study.With these explanations in mind then, the reader is invited to engage on their own voyage through this study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yumi</field><field name="subject">pedagogy;</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">process;</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">integrity;</field><field name="subject">Torres</field><field name="subject">Strait</field><field name="subject">Islander</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006230/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The environmental regulation of mining: an international comparison</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Noeleen</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Over the past 15 years, significant sectors of the mining industry have undertaken the Global Mining Initiative.

As such the Poetics of Mosaic Narrative is designed to assist creators of new media narrative to design dramatically compelling screen based stories by drawing from established theories of cinema and emerging theories of new media. In doing so it validates the crucial element of cinematic storytelling in the digital medium, which due to its fragmentary, variable and re-combinatory nature, affords the opportunity for audience interaction. The Poetics of Mosaic Narrative re-asserts the dramatic and cinematic nature of narrative in new media by drawing upon the dramatic theory of Aristotle&#8217;s Poetics, the cinematic theories of the 1920s Russian Film Theorists and contemporary Neo-Formalists, the narrative theories of the 1960s French Structuralists, and the scriptwriting theories of contemporary cinema. In particular it focuses on the theory and practice of the prominent new media theorist, Lev Manovich, as a means of investigating and creating a practical poetics. The key element of the Poetics of Mosaic Narrative is the expansion of the previously forgotten and undeveloped Russian Formalist concept of cinematurgy which is vital to the successful development of new media storytelling theory and practice. This concept, as originally proposed but not elaborated by Kazansky, encompasses the notion of the creation of cinematic new media narrative as a mosaic &#8211; integrally driven by the narrative systems of plot, as well as the cinematic systems of visual style created by the techniques of cinema- montage, cinematography and mise-en-scene.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cinematography;</field><field name="subject">storytelling;</field><field name="subject">poetics</field><field name="subject">of</field><field name="subject">mosaic</field><field name="subject">narrative;</field><field name="subject">cinematic</field><field name="subject">stories;</field><field name="subject">digital</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006235/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated assembly of industrial transformer cores utilising dual cooperating mobile robots bearing a common electromagnetic gripper</field><field name="creator">Postma, Bradley Theodore</field><field name="description">Automation of the industrial transformer core assembly process is highly desirable. A survey undertaken by the author however, revealed that due to the high cost of existing fully automated systems, Australian manufacturers producing low to medium transformer volumes continue to maintain a manual construction approach. The conceptual design of a cost-effective automation system for core assembly from pre-cut lamination stacks was consequently undertaken. The major hurdle for automating the existing manual process was identified as the difficulty in reliably handling and accurately positioning the constituent core laminations, which number in their thousands, during transformer core construction. Technical evaluation of the proposed pick-and-place core assembly system, incorporating two mobile robots bearing a common gripper, is presented herein to address these requirements.     A unique robotic gripper, having the capability to selectively pick a given number of steel laminations (typically two or three) concurrently from a stack, has the potential to significantly increase productivity. The only available avenue for picking multiple laminations was deemed to be a gripper based on magnetism. Closed form analytical and finite element models for an electromagnet-stack system were contrived and their force distributions obtained. The theoretical findings were validated by experiment using a specially constructed prototype. Critical parameters for reliably lifting the required number of laminations were identified and a full scale electromagnet, that overcame inherent suction forces present in the stack during picking, was subsequently developed.      A mechanical docking arrangement is envisaged that will ensure precise lamination placement. Owing to the grippers unwieldy length however, conventional robots cannot be used for assembling larger cores. Two wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) compliantly coupled to either end of the gripper could be considered although a review of the current literature revealed the absence of a suitable controller. Dynamic modelling for a single WMR was therefore undertaken and later expanded upon for the dual WMR system conceived. Nonlinear adaptive controllers for both WMR systems were developed and subsequently investigated via simulation. Neglecting the systems dynamics resulted in analogous, simplified kinematic control schemes, that were verified experimentally using prototypes. Additional cooperative control laws ensuring the synchronisation of the two robots were also implemented on the prototype system.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electromagnetic</field><field name="subject">Gripper</field><field name="subject">Materials Handling</field><field name="subject">Laminations</field><field name="subject">Autonomous</field><field name="subject">Transformer</field><field name="subject">Mobile Robot</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091125.114646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low temperature wet oxidation and catalytic wet oxidation of specific organic compounds in highly alkaline solution (synthetic Bayer liquor)</field><field name="creator">Tardio, James Andrew</field><field name="description">Low temperature (165&#176;C) Wet Oxidation (WO) and Catalytic Wet Oxidation (CWO) of   12 organic compounds has been studied in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution   (simulating that encountered in the Bayer process used to refine alumina) for the first   time. Most (11 out of 12) of the 12 organic compounds studied (formic, acetic, propionic,   butyric, oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids) have   been identified in various worldwide Bayer liquors. The various aspects of WO and   CWO studied for each of the above-mentioned compounds were as follows;      -Extent of complete oxidation to carbonate (i.e. extent of removal of organic compound)       -Extent of overall oxidation (i.e. extent of complete oxidation and partial oxidation to stable products)       -The product(s) formed from partial (incomplete) oxidation      -The reaction mechanism occurring      -Why certain compounds undergo low temperature WO and/or CWO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution      -The ability of various transition metal oxides to catalyse the WO of the selected organic compounds      Of the 12 organic compounds studied only six (formic, malonic, citric, lactic, malic and   tartaric acids) underwent appreciable (&gt;2% overall oxidation) WO in isolation under the   reaction conditions used (4.4 -7.0 M NaOH, 165&#176;C, 500 kPa Po&#8322;, 2 hours). Each of these six compounds underwent some complete oxidation and therefore can be partly removed   from highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution using low temperature WO. The order   of extent of complete oxidation determined was as follows tartaric&gt; citric&gt; malonic&gt;   formic&gt; lactic&gt; malic. All of these compounds also underwent some partial oxidation   under the reaction conditions used, excluding formic acid, which only underwent   complete oxidation. Oxalic acid was a major product of partial oxidation of all of the   above-mentioned compounds (excluding formic acid), while acetic acid was a major   product of partial oxidation of citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids.       The WO of formic, malonic, citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids varied considerably   with NaOH concentration over the NaOH concentration range studied (4.4 - 7.0 M). The   extent of overall oxidation undergone by each of these compounds increased significantly   with increasing NaOH concentration. All of the compounds that underwent appreciable   WO under the reaction conditions studied contained hydrogen(s) significantly more   acidic then the compounds that did not undergo appreciable WO, thus indicating that only   organic compounds that contain acidic (albeit weakly acidic) hydrogens undergo low   temperature (165&#176;C) WO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution.       Two different reaction mechanisms were identified to occur during low temperature WO   in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution. Malonic and formic acids underwent WO   predominantly via a free radical based reaction mechanism, while citric, lactic, malic and   tartaric acids underwent WO predominantly via an ionic based reaction mechanism.       The six organic compounds that did not undergo appreciable WO in isolation (acetic,   propionic, butyric, oxalic, succinic and glutaric acids) all underwent appreciable WO   when in the presence of malonic acid undergoing low temperature WO. Hence, low   temperature WO of all of the above-mentioned compounds can be initiated by free   radical intermediates produced by malonic acid undergoing WO in highly alkaline, high   ionic strength solution.       The ability of several transition metal oxides to catalyse the WO of the chosen 12 organic   compounds was investigated. Of the transition metal oxides studied CuO was clearly the   most active. Five of the organic compounds studied (malonic, citric, lactic, malic and   tartaric acids) were catalytically wet oxidised by CuO in highly alkaline, high ionic   strength solution in isolation. The order of catalytic activity observed was malonic &gt;   tartaric&gt; lactic&gt; malic&gt; citric.       Two different catalytic reaction mechanisms were identified for CuO catalysed WO in   highly alkaline solution for the organic compounds studied. CuO catalysed the WO of   malonic acid predominantly by catalysing the formation of free radical intermediates.   CuO catalysed the WO of citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids predominantly via a   complexation-based reaction mechanism.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wet oxidation</field><field name="subject">catalytic wet oxidation</field><field name="subject">Bayer liquor</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091126.122251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doing more with less? convergence and public interest in the New Zealand news media</field><field name="creator">Walker, Tamara</field><field name="description">The traditional news media is being reshaped by the phenomenon known as media convergence.

As migrants adjust to the new culture, their traditional cultural values are increasingly challenged by New Zealand cultural values leading to some degree of personal change.

Instead the collection of tests into batteries is common place in clinical assessment. Clinical batteries range from fixed collections of tests administered unchanged to each client, to batteries flexibly constructed according to a process of hypothesis testing whic varies between clients. Reviews of clinical practice indicate that clinicians predominantly employ a semi-flexibly constructed battery, comprised of a core group of measures with the addition of others drawn as needed from an available pool. While this accommodates for clinical concerns, the psychometric characteristics of such a battery tend to be unevaluated and clinicians draw inferences without reference to the resultant associated measurement error. This has been duly noted in the research literature which increasingly cites the need for psychometric evaluation at the battery level. The current investigation was undertaken to address this difficulty of clinical practice and aimed to develop a psychometrically and practically driven actuarial model with practicing clinicians could structure and analyse cognitive batteries with due reference to reliability, validity and clinical utility. To this end, a review of psychometric literature was undertaken to dermine theorical guidelines for the control and measurement of error at the individual test and battery level. Reviews indicated that to successfully accommodate for the impact of random measurement error, clinicians must apply reliability theory to evaluation of the error associated with domain-based combinations of tests. Additionally, to ensure the validity of test-based inferences and avoid errors in decision-making, clinicians must apply empirically vaidated structures of cognitive function to guide test selection and combination. Given the pressing necessity of battery flexibility, it was concluded that clinicians could best accommodate psychometrid and clinical factors by the use of flexibly constructed composite scores. A reliable approach to psychological testing (RAPT) was proposed which applied psychometric theory and clinical factors to the development of a robust battery structure. The RAPT method focussed on the use of composite scores of domain-specific tests, grouped according to empirically validated domains and moderated by direct estimation of composite reliability. The RAPT was developed with the aim of facilitating the application of psychometric, actuarial methodology to a flexible collection of cognitive tests. In explicating the RAPT model, fifteen primary algorithms were derived from psychometric literature and outlined according to 3 stages of battery usage: test selection; test analysis; and, test interpretation. The utility of the RAPT was examined in terms of its capacity to improve psychometric robustness within a flexible battery. Specifically, using simulated demonstration, RAPT was demonstrated to provide a means of formalising empirically validated structure within a battery of tests, of controlling and improving the reliability of domain-based composite scores, of reducing the impact of artifactual errors on domain-based inferences and of applying actuarial methods typically associated with fixed batteries to a flexible collection of measures. Following this, RAPT was demonstrated to replicate existing psychometrically valid and stable interpretative structures. Specifically, RAPT algorithms were used to re-create the normative information provided for the Wide Ranbe Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WRAT-4)Reading Compoiste. Norms calculated using RAPT were compared with those provided in the WRAT-4 interpretative manual with minimal differences found. RAPT algorithms were then used to re-create normative and ipsative tables, summary scores intercorrelations, and reliability coefficients for the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III) summary scores: Full Scale IQ (FSIQ); Verbal IQ (VIQ); Performance IQ (PIQ); Verbal Comprehensive Index (VCI); Perceptual Organisation Index (POI); Processing Speed Index (PSI); and, Working Memory Index (WMI). Again, RAPT, was demonstrated to successfully replicate these data. Finally, the clinical utility of RAPT was demonstrated with the illustration of case examples which outlined the capacity of RAPT to apply psychometrically sound methodology to the tasks of modifying existing composites, modifying existing battery structure and developing battery structure and analyses according to a factor analysis investigation of an Australian normative sample (n=1045). These investigations provided comprehensive evidence of the capacity of the RAPT to enable the direct application of psychometric theory to semi-flexible battery construction in a manner suitable for use in current clinical practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive</field><field name="subject">test;</field><field name="subject">clinical</field><field name="subject">assessment;</field><field name="subject">psychological</field><field name="subject">assessment;</field><field name="subject">clinical</field><field name="subject">batteries;</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="subject">batteries;</field><field name="subject">psychometric</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006240/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a climate-based computer model to reduce wheat harvest losses in Australia</field><field name="creator">Nawi, Nazmi Mat</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Grain harvest represents a period of high risk and is also a bottleneck in a grain production. This study develops a climate-based systems simulation model toinvestigate the economics of high moisture grain harvesting in Australia. The optimum harvesting and drying strategies were determined. The role of grain aeration cooling was also examined. The model software was developed in MATLAB. This model was run on an hourly basis using 15 years of historical weather data (1991-2005) for three main wheat production areas in Australia, represented by Goondiwindi (QLD), Tamworth (NSW) and Scaddan (WA).The Wheat Harvest System Simulation Model (WHSSM) consists of four submodels of weather data, machinery performance, crop loss and economic calculations. Each submodel is represented by mathematical functions and supportedby available theoretical and field data. The weather submodel is used to predict dynamic grain moisture contents for a standing crop in the field. Machinerysubmodel was developed to calculate machinery performance and its operating costs at different grain and weather conditions. The main machinery involved are combineharvester, cooling aerator, and four categories of grain driers. Crop loss submodel is used to quantify grain losses involved during harvest and storage periods, including shedding (yield) losses, header losses, threshing losses, crop quality downgrading losses (due to rainfalls), and storage spoilage losses.The model has been used to predict and compare the possible return for different harvesting and postharvest management strategies. For the reference case (a 1000 ha farm with a high-capacity harvester and medium-capacity drier in Goondiwindi), it is found that the optimum harvest moisture content for using continuous flow drier and batch drier is 14 and 13% (wet basis) respectively. Foraeration simulation, it is found that the use of an aeration cooling system would slightly increase grower&#8217;s return when the drier capacity is inadequate. No positiveimpact can be achieved on return if growers use either high or medium capacity driers. Generally, high capacity harvester travelling at lower speed is preferred.It is also demonstrated that local weather conditions/rainfall patterns can have a very significant influence on grower returns. Growers in dry and warmlocation (e.g. Goondiwindi) will gain better return. It is predicted that at the given model control values, the long-term optimum harvest moisture contents for Goondiwindi, Scaddan and Tamworth are 14, 15 and 17% respectively.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">harvesting;</field><field name="subject">loss;</field><field name="subject">Australia;wheat;</field><field name="subject">climate-based</field><field name="subject">computer</field><field name="subject">model;</field><field name="subject">climate-based</field><field name="subject">system</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">model;</field><field name="subject">high</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">grain</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006241/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational change in Queensland small and medium size
enterprises (SMEs)</field><field name="creator">Poole, Nicole Lesley</field><field name="description">[Abstract]A substantial amount of change management research exists internationally and in Australia in relation to the causes, processes and outcomes of organisational change in large organisations. However this does not reflect the change scenarios in SMEs. Furthermore, the academic and professional discipline of organisational change in Australia, while well-researched in some areas, remains embryonic when translatedto SMEs in a dynamic environment. Very few large scale state-wide and national surveys have been conducted in Australia. This study is filling the theoretical gap inrelation to the theory and practice relating to the nature, extent and characteristics of organisational change in Queensland Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs).The objective of this study was to examine the nature and extent of organisational change in Queensland SMEs. Five research questions were developed to inform thisresearch objective, including: What are the forces of change in Queensland SMEs?; To what extent does the main change driver (change agent) in SMEs possess effectivechange management skills?; What mental models do Queensland SME managers espouse in relation to the management of organisational change?; What is the natureand prevalence of change interventions for achieving organisational change in Queensland SMEs? ; and What is the impact of organisational size on the nature andprevalence of organisational change in Queensland SMEs? Eleven hypotheses in relation to the last research question were developed and tested.To answer the research questions, the study employed the use of quantitative data which was collected through a state-wide mail survey of 1000 Queensland SMEs. A34 percent response rate was achieved. The survey was adapted from a previous validated questionnaire measuring employee management and organisational change practices in Australian SMEs.The results indicate that by far the most important factor in the decision to introduce change in Queensland SMEs was customer expectations for quality. The survey results also show that, overall, the SMEs were able to achieve the objectives they pursued when implementing significant changes. The findings indicate that the main change drivers in Queensland SMEs possess a moderate profile in relation to change management skills. Furthermore, the findings reflect the view that managers tend tosupport forms of limited employee participation and consultation.Change practices are only moderately represented in Australian SMEs. Taken together with low participation of employees in the decision to employ these changes; low levels of union membership; a low presence of specialist HR managers in SMEs; and the fact that the majority of SMEs that do have written strategic plans do not use it to develop operational plans and drive day to day operations; a &#8216;transforming&#8217; scenario in Queensland SMEs is unlikely. However, one very positive trend is the achievement by the majority of SMEs of change objectives pursued. Nevertheless, the fact that the mental models of Queensland SMEs favoured managerial prerogative is of more significance for the effectiveness of both the management of employees and the performance of SMEs.The findings show that organisational size is significant for the factors important in the introduction of organisational change, however size is not particularly significant in relation to the objectives pursued and achieved in the introduction of organisational change. Furthermore, size is also not significant in relation to the extent to which the main change driver (change agent) in SMEs possesses effective change management skills, and the mental models that Queensland SME managers espouse in relation to the management of organisational change. In contrast with these findings, the analysis suggests that organisational size is significant for the prevalence of change interventions/practices, with medium organisations employing change interventions to a significant greater extent. The thesis concludes with commentary on the practical implications for SME managers and policy and several directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational</field><field name="subject">change;</field><field name="subject">organizational</field><field name="subject">size;</field><field name="subject">small</field><field name="subject">and</field><field name="subject">medium</field><field name="subject">size</field><field name="subject">enterprises;</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006242/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">(Re)Birth of the self: ordinary women's complex journey into new motherhood.

In-depth ante- and postnatal interviews were conducted at the 2nd trimester of pregnancy and 8 months post-birth respectively. These women experienced the early motherhood journey as an unsettled period which necessitated the utilisation of four, often contradictory, maternal identities. The four identities, or voices, were Ideal Mother; Challenged, Practical Self; Extended, Spiritual Self; and Independent Self. This research has shown that becoming a mother for contemporary Australian women is simultaneously joyful, thrilling, confronting, depressing, constraining, and empowering. Thus, the transition to motherhood was a complex and chaotic experience which confronted their sense of self. Moreover, it is clear that young women are often under prepared for the paradoxes and intensity of their journeys. My thesis is that for these contemporary Australian women, becoming a mother necessitated drawing on four dominant, often contradictory voices or identities resulting in a complex transitional experience of individual and personal negotiation and integration. The complexity of this life-transition defies simple explanation and solution. Regardless, the findings suggest that all the stories of mothering need to be told to make them equally real, valid, valuable, and normal. Thus can we find and develop new and useful models of modern motherhood to enable policy makers and health practitioners to provide more informed, particular, and empathetic support for new Australian mothers, as well as strengthen future mothers for and feel positive about their mothering careers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">early</field><field name="subject">motherhood;</field><field name="subject">Queensland;</field><field name="subject">feminist</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006243/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling herbicide movement from farm to catchment using the swat model</field><field name="creator">Rattray, Danny James</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Water quality in Australia&#8217;s northern grains farming areas often exceeds water quality trigger values for suspended sediments, nutrients and some herbicides (CBWC, 1999). While there are many land uses in these areas that contribute to the resultant water quality, of particular concern for the grains farming industry is the widespread detection in rivers of chemicals used by their industry, namely atrazine and metolachlor. A comparison of Hodgson Creek catchment (South East Queensland, Australia) herbicide data with national water quality guidelines shows that trigger values are frequently exceeded. That water quality trigger values are exceeded is expected for a highly modified catchment such as Hodgson Creek, and the Australian New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) (2000) guidelines make provision that in such catchments, locally derived targets should be set. Natural resource managers therefore require skills in linking planned management with their ability to set or meet targets. The opportunity suggested itself for using catchment modelling to set realistic targets for water quality based on the adoption of best management farming practices. This study investigated the suitability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to fulfil this modelling role in an Australian context of land use management. To test the suitability of SWAT to fulfil this role, the study aimed to determine the feasibility of using the model to explicitly depict farm management practices at a paddock scale to estimate resultant catchment water quality outcomes. SWAT operates as two distinct sub-models. A hydrologic response unit (HRU) (the paddock scale model) generates runoff and constituents, and the output of many HRU are summed and routed through a stream network. The method for calibration of SWAT proposed in the user manual (Neitsch et al., 2001) is to calibrate against streamflow before calibrating sediment and then herbicides. The logic of testing in a process dependent order is sensible, however the method proposed by Neitsch et al. (2001) assumes that the HRU processes are reliable and calibration only need consider catchment scale processes. A review of the literature suggested that there had been limited testing of HRU process in studies where SWAT had been applied. Data available for model testing came from both paddock and catchment studies. The effects of cultivation management practices on runoff and erosion have been well characterised for the study area by Freebairn and Wockner (1996). Atrazine dissipation in soil and loss in runoff was available from a study of a commercial farm in the Hodgson Creek catchment (Rattray et al, 2007). An ambient and event based water quality monitoring for suspended sediments and herbicides provided data for the Hodgson Creek catchment for the period 1999 to 2004 (Rattray, unpublished data). The model required minimal calibration to achieve good predictions of crop yields and surface cover for winter crops. However, testing of summer cropping component revealed structural problems in SWAT associated with the end of a calendar year. Testing also revealed that perennial pastures and trees are modelled with unrealistic fluctuations in biomass and leaf area index. The model was able to represent hydrology well across a range of scales (1-50,000 ha). Catchment scale runoff data was well matched for a range of tillage treatments. The model was found to be able to attain a good prediction of monthly runoff at the catchment scale. This is consistent with the finding of most other SWAT studies. The model was able to represent average annual erosion reasonably well using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) when tested at the HRU scale (1 ha) against a range of tillage management data. When tested at the catchment scale the model was found to be able to match average annual sediment loads for the catchment however annual variability in sediment loads was poorly matched. Testing of the herbicide model for SWAT found that model compared poorly with paddock scale trial data. The reason for poor model performance can be attributed to an inadequate representation of processes and model output was unrealistic compared to our understanding of herbicide transport processes. When the model was tested at a catchment scale it was found to compare very poorly with catchment scale observations. This can be explained in part by the deficiencies of the HRU herbicide model, but is also due in part to difficulties in parameterisation of spatial and temporal inputs at the catchment scale. While SWAT provides a model with detailed physical processes, the capacity to apply the model is let down by an ability to practically determine the spatial and temporal extent of the farming practices (i.e. where and when are tillage and herbicides applied in the catchment). The challenge to applying SWAT is that farming practices in Australia vary markedly from year to year. SWAT requires the user to input crop practices in as a fixed rotation while Australia&#8217;s highly variable climate with unreliable seasonal weather patterns results in opportunistic farming practices. Hence this is a major limitation in the models ability to predict catchment outcomes, particularly for herbicides where off site losses are highly dependant on application timing. In attempting to validate herbicide losses at the whole of catchment scale it became apparent that uncertainty in the temporal variation of farm operations within the catchment poses a major limitation to accurately reproducing observations at the catchment outlet. It is concluded that that there is limited usefulness of SWAT for investigating the impacts of land management on catchment scale herbicide transport for Australian conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herbicide;</field><field name="subject">farm;</field><field name="subject">catchment;</field><field name="subject">swat</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006245/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Better characterisation of the underwater solar ultraviolet environment using a high-exposure dosimeter</field><field name="creator">Schouten, Peter</field><field name="description">[Abstract]This dissertation presents the development, testing and application of a chemical film UV dosimeter based on the polymer Poly (2, 6-dimethyl-1, 4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) prepared especially for long &#8211; term high &#8211; exposure underwater use. Initial testing of the dosimeter was performed in a water tank within a controlled laboratory environment with an artificial UV source in which various optical and physical properties of the film were rigorously tested such as UV dose and depth response, cosine response, interdosimeter variation, dose rate independence, dark reaction, watermarking effect, exposure additivity and visible and UVA wavelength response. In each of these tests the PPO dosimeter displayed results proving that it could be reliably used in aquatic environments at a level of accuracy only slightly lower than what could be expected for in &#8211; air dosimetric measurements. The use of a polyethylene derived neutral density filter (NDF) was then employed with the PPO dosimeter in order to extend exposure time. Results from this investigation showed that the polyethylene NDF could extend the effective life time of the PPO dosimeter by as much as five days in early autumn. Following this the PPO dosimeter was calibrated in the field to the solar erythemal action spectrum in &#8211; air and to the solar UVB spectrum in clear water, creek water, sea water and dam water over the duration of a year. In both the in &#8211; air and underwater calibrations it was found that the response of the PPO dosimeter lasted over a much greater amount of time when compared to the more commonly used polysulphone dosimeter and also varied with the modulation of the incident solar spectrum brought on by changing SZA and fluctuations in atmospheric column ozone. Additionally, it was discovered that in &#8211; air and underwater calibration regimes could not be interchanged and that the PPO dosimeter response underwater is dependent upon water type, but only when transmission spectra differed between two water types by a difference on average of more than 5% across the UVB waveband. As a final test, the PPO dosimeter was deployed over a year to take UVB exposure measurements with the use of a custom built submersible float in three different real &#8211; world field environments that included a creek, a sea water tank and a stagnant dam. Exposures could be measured reliably up to a depth of 5 cm in the creek water and the dam water and up to and possibly beyond a depth of 35 cm in the sea water. From the sea water PPO dosimeter measurements a series of attenuation coefficients were estimated for each season. These coefficients showed reasonable agreement when compared to attenuation coefficient calculations made using a calibrated spectrometer in the same sea water, further proving the usefulness of the PPO dosimeter.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">underwater;</field><field name="subject">solar;</field><field name="subject">ultraviolet;</field><field name="subject">environment;</field><field name="subject">dosimeter</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006248/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dimensions of organisational knowledge management (OKM). A study on malaysian managers using the multidimensional USQ KM scale</field><field name="creator">Skadiang, Barbara</field><field name="description">[Abstract]The case for knowledge management (KM) is firmly established in the wealth of extant literature available and is well corroborated in business best practices.However, the broad scope of KM and its multiple approaches in varied contexts,while credited for their diversity and flexibility, also call for greater universality and coherence in several areas, one of which is in the assessment of organisational knowledge management (OKM) practice. While literature attests to the dynamics of the different dimensions of KM, very limited research hasbeen conducted using a standardised multidimensional scale. This dissertation pertains to the application of an in-house developed instrument, called the USQ KM scale, to empirically study the three key dimensions of OKM identified through literature review, namely OKM strategy, OKM culture and OKM process/technology. The instrument was employed to assess the extent of OKM practice in organisations in Malaysia. Results of the survey on 153 managers provided insights into the state of OKM practice in Malaysia while confirming the mutually dependent relationship between the three dimensions of OKM andgiving rise to the researcher&#8217;s proposed conceptual tripartite OKM model. In addition, demographic factors such as the number of years of service in the organisation and years of service in a specific organisational role were found to have an impact on OKM, supporting previous empirically tested truths about OKM besides revealing a few unique traits in the Malaysian sample. The implications of the study for organisations in Malaysia as well as in other developing countries within similar contexts are especially meaningful for smaller local businesses without the benefit of multinational affiliations usually associated with superior KM capability afforded by greater economies of scale and more sizeable budgets for infrastructure support.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">management;</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006252/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of shear damaged reinforced concrete beams strengthened with external post-tensioning and clamping</field><field name="creator">Suntharavadivel, Thuraichamy Guganesan</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Over the last few decades, there has been a rapid increase in the volume and weight of heavy vehicles using national road networks. More than half of the bridges around the world are over forty years old. The deterioration of these existing bridges due to increased traffic loading, progressive structural aging, and reinforcement corrosion from severe environmental conditions has become a major problem in most countries. Several techniques have been used to strengthen these structures around the world. External post-tensioning is one of the widely used strengthening techniques in many countries due to its advantages over other methods. Furthermore, flexural strengthening using external post-tensioning has become a well established technique over the past few decades. However, when external post-tensioning is used to strengthen shear damaged reinforced concrete members, unlike flexural damage, the efficiency is significantly reduced by existing shear cracks.This research study was carried out to investigate the behaviour of reinforced concrete beams with existing shear cracks when strengthened by external means. The study consists of two parts: experimental investigations of reinforced concrete beams with different parameters and numerical analysis of reinforced concrete beams usingsimplified theoretical formulation and finite element modelling.To study the behaviour of shear damaged concrete beams, two different strengthening techniques, namely external post-tensioning and external clamping, were used. In addition to the strengthening, the effect of cracks on the behaviour of reinforced concrete beams was investigated by repairing such cracks using epoxy resin injection. Experimental results showed that existing shear cracks have a substantial effect on the member capacity when strengthened by external posttensioning. Although there are concerns about the practical applications of externalclamping, the experimental results suggest that external clamping could be a more effective technique than external post-tensioning to reduce the effect of existing shear cracks on the behaviour of concrete beams. Furthermore, proper repair of the shear cracks could significantly reduce their impact.In the numerical analysis, a simplified mathematical approach was developed to estimate the capacity of shear damaged reinforced concrete beam by expanding themodified compression field theory (MCFT). In addition to the simplified theoretical formulation, a finite element model was developed using the commercial finite element package, Abaqus. Comparison between the predicted behaviour using finite element analysis (FEA) and the experimental data illustrated that the developed finite element model could be used as a reliable tool to estimate the capacity of shear damaged reinforced concrete beams. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of different parameters such as concrete strength, amount of shear reinforcement and crack width, using the developed finite element model. From the numerical study, it was concluded that the simplified approach developedin this study can be used as a reliable and conservative technique to predict the member capacity of a cracked reinforced concrete beam strengthened by external means. Furthermore, the parametric study showed that crack width is the most sensitive parameter that affects the capacity of a cracked beam strengthened by external post-tensioning.Based on this research study it can be concluded that existing shear cracks have a substantial effect on the behaviour of reinforced concrete beams strengthened byexternal post-tensioning. The simplified mathematical approach developed in this study can be used to estimate the capacity of such beams.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">road</field><field name="subject">networks;</field><field name="subject">bridges;</field><field name="subject">traffic</field><field name="subject">loading;</field><field name="subject">structural</field><field name="subject">aging;</field><field name="subject">corrosion;</field><field name="subject">strengthening</field><field name="subject">techniques;</field><field name="subject">reinforced</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">beams;</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">cracks;</field><field name="subject">external</field><field name="subject">post-tensioning;</field><field name="subject">clamping</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006254/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destination segmentation: a recommended two-step approach</field><field name="creator">Tkaczynski, Aaron</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Market segmentation has been identified in the tourism marketing literature as an effective tool that can be used by management to meet the needs of a market more efficiently and effectively. It has been widely used by researchers seeking to develop tourism segments. Historically, most segmentation studies have developed tourism profiles at a destination using 1) a visitor questionnaire survey developed from studies in the literature or 2) secondary data. Very little research has taken a stakeholder approach to destination segmentation, despite many authors arguing the importance of utilising a stakeholder approach for destination management and marketing purposes. This research proposes a two-step approach to destination segmentation. It details this approach using one Australian destination. The two-step approach to segmentation begins with firstly understanding how tourism stakeholders at a destination segment their market before surveying tourists for the purposes of identifying segments. In contrast to previous tourist-focused segmentation studies, the two-step approach recommended and detailed in this study considers both tourism stakeholders and tourists. The segments devised from the proposed approach are then compared and contrasted with segments currently utilised by the destination marketing organisation (DMO). Step one involved interviewing 14 tourism stakeholders to determine how they segment the market. Based on these findings, a questionnaire survey was developed and data was collected from 852 tourists. This represented step two of the approach. Three tourism segments were identified through cluster analysis. Only one of these three segments was comparable with the segments defined by the DMO. The other two were not considered in the DMO segmentation. These segments represented over half of all tourists in the sample. Based on the sample in this study, the DMO segments target less than a quarter of the types of tourists visiting the destination. Contributions to theory and practice were identified. Firstly, it was recognised that different tourism stakeholders attract different tourists, not all stakeholders segment their market, and some stakeholders do not adhere to segments targeted by the DMO which may lead to an inconsistent message in the market. Secondly, the two-step approach is a new method incorporating a stakeholder view, which gives a more holistic view and a richer description for the segments obtained when compared with academic and practitioner segmentation approaches. The two-step approach can be utilised at other tourist destinations. The two-step approach to segmentation is capable of assisting tourism marketers to target more of the tourists frequenting the destination. This study suggests that many dollars may be wasted targeting tourists that are not likely to travel to the destination and not targeting those who would. Future research should be conducted at alternative destinations to further the understanding of the recommended two-step approach to segmentation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">market</field><field name="subject">segmentation;</field><field name="subject">stakeholder</field><field name="subject">theory;</field><field name="subject">TwoStep&#174;</field><field name="subject">cluster</field><field name="subject">analysis;</field><field name="subject">destination;</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">market</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006255/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Repositioning of a Stakeholder Issue applied at Pfizer Switzerland</field><field name="creator">Ulrich, Georges Simon</field><field name="description">[Abstract]How can a company implement its stakeholder orientation in the interaction with its stakeholders via the media? The study is a descriptive analysis of the starting point for a campaign-oriented approach using Pfizer Switzerland as a case study. In this paper, a framework is developed on the basis of the stakeholder and the campaigning approach. This allows a company to identify how its declared stakeholder orientation is perceived within the company, by the population and the media, in order to initiate a comprehensive stakeholder communication and encourage the stakeholders to communicate with the company in appropriate fields of interaction. To achieve this, the social-economic survey research was used as a process instrument. This is generally accepted as an objectification function. On a comprehensive structural level, it should enable management to understand its environment pertaining to a specific issue, and to communicate in such a way as to achieve the desired effect. The framework was applied to the issue of trust at Pfizer. The study concludes that the role of the media, in its primary function and in its role as a platform for initiating dialogues on appropriate interaction fields, contains potential for Pfizer. At the same time, a distinction was made between the relevance of the media, and the difference between the reports published by the media and the actual perception in the population. In particular, political orientation appears to be significant for the question of having trust in Pfizer. The framework, developed on the basis of empirical opinion research, has contributed toward the management of Pfizer seeing how the company is actually perceived in the population, thereby providing a basis for further critical reflection and decision making.At Pfizer, one is convinced that the media play an important role in the communicative implementation of a stakeholder-oriented vision. Challenges need to be met so that in the future a direct and mutual exchange with the relevant stakeholders will lead to the goal of actually being perceived by the population as a trustworthy company.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stakeholder</field><field name="subject">orientation;</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006256/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of the undrained vertical bearing capacity of shallow foundations</field><field name="creator">Quoc, Van Nguyen</field><field name="description">[Abstract]The bearing capacity of foundations is a fundamental problem in geotechnical engineering. For all structures placed on a soil foundation, geotechnical engineers must ensure that the soil has sufficient load carrying capacity so that the foundation does not collapse or become unstable under any conceivable loading. The ultimate bearing capacity is the magnitude of bearing pressure at which the supporting ground is expected to fail in shear, i.e. a collapse will take place.During the last fifty years various researchers have proposed approximate techniques to estimate the short term undrained bearing capacity of foundations. The majority of existing theories are not entirely rigorous and contain many underlying assumptions. As a consequence, current design practices include a great deal of empiricism. Throughout recent decades, there has also been a dramatic expansion in numerical techniques and analyses, however, very few rigorous numerical analyses have been performed todetermine the ultimate bearing capacity of undrained soils.In this study, finite element analysis has been used to analyse a range of bearing capacity problems in undrained soil. The numerical models account for a range of variablesincluding footing size, shape, embedment depth, soil layering and undrained bearing capacity of footings on slopes.By using the powerful ability of computers a comprehensive set of solutions have been obtained therefore reducing the uncertainties apparent in previous solutions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bearing</field><field name="subject">capacity;</field><field name="subject">foundations;</field><field name="subject">geotechnical</field><field name="subject">engineers;</field><field name="subject">theories;</field><field name="subject">undrained</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006257/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallisation spectrometer</field><field name="creator">Francis, Philip Sydney</field><field name="description">An improved crystallisation spectrometer has been designed, built and tested. It is to be used by others to gain new knowledge about the solidification of matter by study of the crystallisation of hard sphere colloid samples that are an established model for the behaviour of some aspects of atoms.   In this crystallisation spectrometer, expanded and collimated green laser light is Bragg scattered from the colloidal crystals as they form, and the diffracted light is focused by a liquid filled hollow glass hemispherical lens onto low cost CCD array detectors that are rotated about the optical axis to average the intensities around the whole Debye-Scherrer cone of scattered light. The temperature of the sample is controlled to +/-0.1&#132;a, and because of the ability to change the refractive index of the sample particles with temperature, this is utilised to control the amount of scattering from the sample   Also, this spectrometer uniquely exploits the refractive index match of the colloidal particles, the solvent, the bath liquid, and the glass used for both the sample bottle and the hollow glass hemisphere.   A unique facility has been incorporated to permit tumbling of the sample prior to the measurement commencing to shear-melt any pre-existing crystals. This ensures that the sample is completely fluid and is at the correct temperature at the start of the measurement.   The instrument is assembled on an optical table and is computer controlled.   Results presented show that this new spectrometer with its use of the whole Debye-Scherrer cone of Bragg scattered light and other enhancements gives insight into the crystallisation process more than one order of magnitude of time earlier than previous light scattering experiments, providing new knowledge about the crystallisation process.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bragg scattering</field><field name="subject">colloidal crystals</field><field name="subject">Debye-Scherrer crystallisation</field><field name="subject">colloids</field><field name="subject">hard-sphere</field><field name="subject">solidification</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20050617.121435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring contractors' business performance : effective use of a balanced scorecard approach</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Antony Johnson Jerytton</field><field name="description">It can be stated that performance measurement is the foundation of performance management in any construction organisation. Traditional financial performance measurement is not capable of capturing the true performance of an organisation. Thus the results of such financial performance measurement can not be used by managers to derive future performance in their organisations. The balanced scorecard (BSC) performance measurement approach used in other industries has been proposed for construction, as it takes into account critical wider perspectives. However, the construction BSC consists of four perspectives that are highly suitable for construction industry, namely business development, stakeholder management, process management, and innovation and learning. The primary objective of the research is to develop a balanced scorecard framework for construction contractors and measure performance of contractors using that framework. The results of the questionnaire s urvey carried out and follow-up interviews conducted among 34 senior managers in Melbourne revealed that the above performance measurement framework is appropriate to use in a contracting organisation. The respondents perceive that the process management perspective measurement is more desirable than others. The stakeholder management perspective received moderate rating, while business development and innovation and learning perspectives both received average importance rating by the respondents. An actual performance measurement carried out on seven contractors in Melbourne to illustrate the use of the BSC performance as a strategic performance management tool in construction reveals the following:   1.	Contractors' current performance levels in regard to process management and business development are moderately high, while stakeholder management and innovation and learning performance are perceived to be average. The contractors also perceive that performance in regard to stakeholder management is of higher significance for their business success, and    2.	Performance with regard to managing employees and launching knowledge management initiatives was found to be low, so there is much room for improvement.   Human resource management (HRM) is managing employees to develop and utilise their full potential in alignment with organisational objectives.   It is recommended that contractors have to introduce new strategies for HRM. The HRM strategies should focus on recruitment, training and development activities of employees. Apart from HRM, the knowledge management (KM) also needs attention. The KM can be stated as effective use of available resources to increase the level of learning and innovation in the organisation. To enhance performance of KM contractors have to conduct project reviews on completion of every project and document useful information. This would enable managers to discuss company-wide performance at management meetings and further scrutinise this information. Having separate Balanced Scorecards for HRM and KM is expected to bring enormous advantages for a contracting company.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">balanced scorecard</field><field name="subject">performance measurement</field><field name="subject">performance management</field><field name="subject">stakeholder management</field><field name="subject">innovation and learning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20040927.164737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conceptual framework : the views of natural shareholders in Australia</field><field name="creator">Myers, Paul James</field><field name="description">An enquiry into the relevance and reliability of accounting information that is provided to natural shareholders in Australia.

Subject of a timely and sustained international response, it was feted as a rare preventive success for the international community.  Whilst not necessarily decisive, this mobilisation helped ensure a non-violent transition to independence.  Yet, much to the surprise of outside observers, Macedonia would fall into conflict a decade after independence, when self-styled freedom fighters purporting to represent the local Albanian community launched an eight-month insurgency in the name of political and cultural equality.  Triggered by a coalescence of political, nationalist, ideological and criminal interests, the insurgency had complex roots, as much an intra-Albanian putsch as a struggle for greater group rights.        Regardless of their precise genesis, from the perspective of conflict prevention, the events of 2001 challenge popular assumptions of Macedonia as an international success story.  Above all, they reinforce the need for external actors to incorporate short-term strategies of prevention targeting immediate sources of instability within a more comprehensive, long-term framework that addresses structural, underlying conflict causes.  Indeed, whilst proximate threats to Macedonian stability were addressed, fundamental risk factors remained, namely social polarisation, a large ethnic minority disenfranchised with the state, economic under-development, high levels of organised crime and corruption, a weak rule-of-law and continuing regional uncertainty.  These were partly aggravated by the mistakes of a complacent international community, whose engagement in the country, accordingly, receded over time.  In particular, the dissertation is critical of the European Union for its initial failure to articulate a genuine  pathway to membership for Macedonia and the broader western Balkans, as well as the handling of NATO's military intervention in neighbouring Kosovo.  Of course, in any preventive endeavour, the international community can only do so much; in the first instance, responsibility lay with unresponsive Macedonian institutions, who failed to adequately address legitime Albanian demands dating from independence.  Be that as it may, the international community was culpable for its failure to sufficiently apply the formidable soft-power leverage it wields over a weak Macedonian state to implement reforms that, conceivably, could have precluded the outbreak of armed conflict.     As a case-study of prevention, Macedonia holds instructive lessons for scholars and policymakers.  Yet it remains under-researched.  Examining the period 1991-2001, this investigation analyses precisely why and how Macedonia avoided violence during the process of Yugoslav dissolution yet ultimately fell into conflict, and extrapolates broader lessons that may be applied to other at-risk societies.  Its purpose is to advance understanding of a poorly understood country, and contribute knowledge to key on-going international security debates.  Highlighting the inter-connectedness and trans-national character of contemporary security threats, it posits that the major powers have a practical interest in addressing emerging intra-state crises, even when the putative national interest appears marginal.  To facilitate more timely multilateral responses, it calls for the de-nationalisation of security, and its conceptualisation in international - as opposed to strictly national - terms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Republic of Macedonia</field><field name="subject">former Yugoslavia</field><field name="subject">conflict prevention</field><field name="subject">intra-societal conflict</field><field name="subject">insurgency</field><field name="subject">conflict management</field><field name="subject">conditions of intra-state peace</field><field name="subject">de-nationalisation of security.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090507.141532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Let's talk (discreetly) about sex.

The research outlined in this thesis approaches the issue of sexual health information provision for young people living in Vietnam from a participatory action research foundation. A key focus is investigation of the ways in which young people living in Vietnam can be included in the development of online sexual health communication tools by, for and about young Vietnamese.       As part of this investigation, this thesis describes research conducted with young Vietnamese in Australia and Vietnam to identify and elucidate their reproductive health information needs, as situated within the contemporary Vietnamese socio-cultural context. The research was undertaken in order to determine how an online resource might meet these needs. This exploratory process involved the utilisation of a range of research methods to determine the website's optimal content, style, features and tone in relation to the Vietnamese context and requirements of its target users.      It is hoped that the record of discovery resulting from this research journey will contribute to the existing body of knowledge on online health communication and participatory approaches to the development of context-sensitive health and behaviour-change communication.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">communications</field><field name="subject">sexual health</field><field name="subject">reproductive health</field><field name="subject">sex education</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">health communication.

This is mainly due to their high strength and light weight characteristics. But with all the advantages they have, they are prone to delamination or matrix cracking. These types of damage are often invisible and if undetected, could lead to appalling failures of structures. Although there are systems to detect such damage, the criticality assessment and prognosis of the damage is often more difficult to achieve. The research study conducted here primarily deals with the structural health monitoring of composite materials by analysing vibration signatures acquired from a laser vibrometer. The primary aim of the project is to develop a vibration based structural health monitoring (SHM) method for detecting flaws such as delamination within the composite beams. Secondly, the project emphasises on the method's ability to recognise the locatio n and severity of the damage within the structure. The system proposed relies on the examination of the displacement mode shapes acquired from the composite beams using the laser vibrometer and later processing them to curvature mode shapes for damage identification and characterization. Other identification techniques such as a C-scan has been applied to validate the location and size of the defects with the structures tested. The output from these plots enabled the successful identification of both the location and extent of damage within the structure with an accuracy of 96.5%. In addition to this, this project also introduces a method to experimentally compute the critical stress intensity factor, KIC for the composite beam. Based on this, a technique for extending the defect has been proposed and validated using concepts of fatigue and fracture mechanics. A composite specimen with a 40 mm wide delamination embedded within was loaded under fatigue conditions and extension of the defect by 4mm on either s ide of the specimen's loading axis was achieved satisfactorily. The experimental procedure to extend the defect using fatigue was validated using the SLV system. Displacement and Curvature mode shapes were acquired post-fatigue crack extension. Upon analysing and comparing the displacement and curvature mode shapes before and after crack extension, the extended delamination was identified satisfactorily.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural Health Monitoring</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Damage</field><field name="subject">Curvature Mode Shapes</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Response</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091002.143408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unsupervised Color Image Segmentation Using Markov Random Fields Model</field><field name="creator">Islam, Mofakharul .

The aim is to devise a robust unsu- pervised segmentation approach that can segment a color textured image accurately. Here, the color and texture information of each individual pixel along with the pixel's spatial relationship within its neighborhood have been considered for producing precise segmentation of color images. Precise segmentation of images has tremendous potential in various application domains like bioinformatics, forensics, security and surveillance, the mining and material industry and medical imaging where subtle information related to color and texture is required to analyze an image accurately. We intend to implement a robust unsupervised segmentation approach for color im- ages using a newly developed multidimensional spatially variant &#175;nite mixture model (MSVFMM) using a Markov Random Fields (MRF) model for improving the over- all accuracy in segmentation and Haar wavelet transform for increasing the texture sensitivity of the proposed approach.

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">The complexity in building massive scale parallel processing systems has re- sulted in a growing interest in the study of interconnection networks design. Network design affects the performance, cost, scalability, and availability of parallel computers. Therefore, discovering a good structure of the network is one of the basic issues. From modeling point of view, the structure of networks can be naturally stud- ied in terms of graph theory. Several common desirable features of networks, such as large number of processing elements, good throughput, short data com- munication delay, modularity, good fault tolerance and diameter vulnerability correspond to properties of the underlying graphs of networks, including large number of vertices, small diameter, high connectivity and overall balance (or regularity) of the graph or digraph. The first part of this thesis deals with the issue of interconnection networks ad- dressing system. From graph theory point of view, this issue is mainly related to a graph labeling. We investigate a special family of graph labeling, namely antimagic labeling of a class of disconnected graphs. We present new results in super (a; d)-edge antimagic total labeling for disjoint union of multiple copies of special families of graphs. The second part of this thesis deals with the issue of regularity of digraphs with the number of vertices close to the upper bound, called the Moore bound, which is unobtainable for most values of out-degree and diameter. Regularity of the underlying graph of a network is often considered to be essential since the flow of messages and exchange of data between processing elements will be on average faster if there is a similar number of interconnections coming in and going out of each processing element. This means that the in-degree and out-degree of each processing element must be the same or almost the same. Our new results show that digraphs of order two less than Moore bound are either diregular or almost diregular.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An In-Vehicle Data Acquisition System to Monitor the Service Conditions of Brake Systems</field><field name="creator">Fumi, Duncan .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) is marked by deficits in attention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The current DSM-IV conceptualisation of AD/HD as comprising of separate, but related, Inattention (IA) and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (H/I) dimensions have been supported in confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) studies. Despite being one of the most extensively studied childhood disorder, there is a lack of research on AD/HD in non-western populations. Research on AD/HD in Asian countries, particularly, is limited. To date, no study has comprehensively investigated the characteristics of AD/HD in a Malaysian sample. The current study had 4 major aims. The first aim of the study was to investigate how the IA and H/I symptoms groups vary by age, gender, and age by gender interaction. The second aim of the study was to obtain prevalence rates of DSM-IV AD/HD and the three subtypes (i.e., Predominantly Inattentive Type, AD/HD-IA; Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Type, AD/HD-H/I; and Combined Type, AD/HD-C) within this population. This was examined for boys and girls separately, and together. The third aim of the study was to investigate the internal validity of DSM-IV AD/HD using single source confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), while the fourth aim of the study was to examine trait, source and error variance of the AD/HD symptoms using the CFA multitrait (IA and H/I) by multisource (parent and teacher) approach (CFA MT-MS). All the CFA and CFA MT-MS analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls and used scores recoded via the binary method, as opposed to the ordinal scoring method. The sample consisted of 934 Malaysian schoolchildren aged 6-12 years (436 boys: mean age 8.86 years; and 498 girls: mean age 9.02 years) [...] There was more source than trait variance for parent rated H/I and teacher rated IA for girls. Unique to the current study is the use of binary as opposed to ordinal data to run the CFA and MTMS analysis. The implications of the findings for the conceptualisation, assessment, treatment, psychometric properties of AD/HD rating scales and the recognition of AD/HD in the Malaysian population are discussed.

A cycle that contains every vertex of a graph is called a hamiltonian cycle and a graph which contains a hamiltonian cycle is called a hamiltonian graph. The problem of the existence of a hamiltonian cycle is closely related to the well known problem of a travelling salesman. These problems are NP-complete and NP-hard, respectively. While some necessary and sufficient conditions are known, to date, no practical characterization of hamiltonian graphs has been found. There are several ways to generalize the notion of a hamiltonian cycle.

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">This research investigated the feasibility and capability of neural network-based approaches for predicting the direction of the Australian Stock market index (the target market). It includes several aspects: univariate feature selection from the historical time series of the target market, inter-market analysis for finding the most relevant influential markets, investigations of the effect of time cycles on the target market and the discovery of the optimal neural network architectures. Previous research on US stock markets and other international markets have shown that the neural network approach is one of most powerful techniques for predicting stock market behaviour. Neural networks are capable of capturing the non-linear stochastic and chaotic patterns in the stock market time series data. This study discovered that the relative return series of the Open, High, Low and Close prices of the target market, show 6-day cycles during the studied period of about 14 years. Multi-layer feedforward neural networks trained with a backpropagation algorithm were used for the experiments. Two major testing methods: testing with randomly selected test data and forward testing, were examined and compared. The best neural network developed in this study has achieved 87%, 81% 83% and 81% accuracy respectively in predicting the next-day direction of the relative return of the Open, High, Low and Close prices of the target market. The architecture of this network consists of 33 input features, one hidden layer with 3 neurons and 4 output neurons. The best input features set includes the relative returns from 1 to 6 days in the past of the Open, High, Low and Close prices of the target market, the day of the week, and the previous day&#8217;s relative return of the Close prices of the US S&amp;P 500 Index, US Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, US Gold/Silver Index, and the US Oil Index.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="subject">Stock price</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Stock index futures</field><field name="subject">Stock exchanges</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harambe : strategic alliance formation and performance evaluation in the tourism sector of travel</field><field name="creator">Pansiri, Jaloni .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to develop some new algorithms based on optimization techniques for solving some problems in some areas of telecommunications and the Internet. There are two main parts to this thesis. In the first part we discuss optimization based stochastic and queueing models in telecommunications network corrective maintenance. In the second part we develop optimization based clustering (OBC) algorithms for network evolution and multicast routing. The most typical scenario encountered during mathematical optimization modelling in telecommunications, for example, is to minimize the cost of establishment and maintenance of the networks subject to the performance constraints of the networks and the reliability constraints of the networks as well. Most of these optimization problems are global optimization, that is, they have many local minima and most of these local minima do not provide any useful information for solving these problems. Therefore, the development of effective methods for solving such global optimization problems is important. To run the telecommunications networks with cost-effective network maintenance,we need to establish a practical maintenance model and optimize it. In the first part of the thesis, we solve a known stochastic programming maintenance optimization model with a direct method and then develop some new models. After that we introduce queue programming models in telecommunications network maintenance optimization. The ideas of profit, loss, and penalty will help telecommunications companies have a good view of their maintenance policies and help them improve their service. In the second part of this thesis we propose the use of optimization based clustering (OBC) algorithms to determine level-constrained hierarchical trees for network evolution and multicast routing. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem with a non-smooth, non-convex objective function. Different algorithms are examined for solving this problem.

The work conveys the story of my life at this locale and pursues the motives behind the purchase of the country property, the experiences and remembrances that exist from this period of time and reflects upon the implications of a way of life over the last three decades. While considering the impact that a landscape can have on individual lives, it became important to consolidate the insights that surfaced for me with respect to my own life and works and compare it with that of other selected landscape artists. This comparison took into account personal and family backgrounds, artistic techniques, relationships with the land and the motivations that resulted in the depiction of particular landscapes.

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Mechanics&#8217; Institutes were an integral element of the nineteenth-century British adult education movement, which was itself part of an on-going radicalisation of the working class. Such was the popularity of Mechanics&#8217; Institutes, and so reflective of contemporary British cultural philosophy, that they were copied throughout the British Empire. The Ballaarat Mechanics&#8217; Institute, established in 1859, instilled a powerful, male-gendered British middle-class influence over the cultural, social and educational development of the Ballarat city. The focus of this study is to identify and analyse the significance of the contribution made by the Ballaarat Mechanics&#8217; Institute to the evolving cultural development of the wider Ballarat community, with a particular emphasis on the gender and class dimensions of this influence. This is done within the context of debates about &#8216;radical fragments&#8217; and &#8216;egalitarianism&#8217;. Utilizing a methodology based on an extensive review of archival records, contemporary newspapers held at the Ballaarat Mechanics&#8217; Institute, and previously published research, this study was able to show that, during the period from its inception in 1859 to 1880, the Institute became a focal point for numerous cultural, social and educational activities. As one of the few institutions open to all classes, it was in a position to provide a significant influence over the developing culture of the Ballarat community. The study has also identified the use made of the Institute&#8217;s School of Design by women and the contribution of these educational classes to preparing women for employment outside their traditional roles of wives and mothers. The thesis argues that despite some early radical elements, the Ballaarat Mechanics&#8217; Institute initially espoused liberal egalitarian values. By 1880, however, the Institute was more readily identifiable as reflecting British, male, middle-class values.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ballaarat</field><field name="subject">Ballarat</field><field name="subject">Mechanics' Institute</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comprehensive profile of elite tennis and strategies to enhance match play performance</field><field name="creator">Hornery, Daniel .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">This research investigated the feasibility and capability of neural network-based approaches for predicting the direction of the Australian Stock market index (the target market). It includes several aspects: univariate feature selection from the historical time series of the target market, inter-market analysis for finding the most relevant influential markets, investigations of the effect of time cycles on the target market and the discovery of the optimal neural network architectures. Previous research on US stock markets and other international markets have shown that the neural network approach is one of most powerful techniques for predicting stock market behaviour. Neural networks are capable of capturing the non-linear stochastic and chaotic patterns in the stock market time series data. This study discovered that the relative return series of the Open, High, Low and Close prices of the target market, show 6-day cycles during the studied period of about 14 years. Multi-layer feedforward neural networks trained with a backpropagation algorithm were used for the experiments. Two major testing methods: testing with randomly selected test data and forward testing, were examined and compared. The best neural network developed in this study has achieved 87%, 81% 83% and 81% accuracy respectively in predicting the next-day direction of the relative return of the Open, High, Low and Close prices of the target market. The architecture of this network consists of 33 input features, one hidden layer with 3 neurons and 4 output neurons. The best input features set includes the relative returns from 1 to 6 days in the past of the Open, High, Low and Close prices of the target market, the day of the week, and the previous day&#8217;s relative return of the Close prices of the US S&amp;P 500 Index, US Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, US Gold/Silver Index, and the US Oil Index.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stock price</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Stock index futures</field><field name="subject">Stock exchanges</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrokinetic remediation of arsenic contaminated soils</field><field name="creator">Mewett, John .

It also identifies and comments on shortcomings in Kristevan theory. Donaldson's fantasies are dominated by male protagonists, one of whom is a leper while the others are rapists or murderers or else engaged in some form of violence or sexual perversion. This thesis not only offers an interpretation for this representation of disease and gross physical abuse, but also looks to the implication such corporeality brings to bear on the amatory relationships that the novels attempt to establish. "The thesis is organized into three broad sections. The first considers the ways in which the concept of the mother manifests in Donaldson's text and how the male protagonists respond to the maternal dynamic established in these books. [...] The second section of the thesis examines the role played by Donaldson's father figures.

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Arid areas are often overgrazed and dysfunctional with poor recruitment of desirable species, diminished control over resources and altered soil properties. Restoration ecology re-establishes these valued processes. State-and-transition models summarise knowledge of vegetation dynamics and tools for restoration, and encourage the incorporation of new information. The model developed here for semi-arid woodlands of north-west Victoria highlighted the unknown cause of observed, natural recruitment and the need for a technique, other than direct seeding and handplanting, for enhancing the recruitment of desirable species. I pursued these knowledge gaps for two dominant, woodland trees: Allocasuarina luehmannii and Casuarina pauper. Natural recruitment of juvenile C. pauper was found to be limited and primarily from root suckers. Extensive recruitment of A. luehmannii was shown to be mostly seedlings established following substantial reductions in grazing pressure since 1996. Seedlings were associated with areas devoid of ground flora near a female tree. The importance of competition between seedlings and ground flora, spatial variation in soil moisture and individual variation in the quantity of seed produced deserves further investigation to enhance future restoration success. Root suckers of both C. pauper and A. luehmannii can be artificially initiated, albeit in low numbers and this was found to be a feasible, new tool for restoration. Suckers are preceded by the growth of callus tissue on exposed or damaged, living, shallow roots. Both male and female trees can produce suckers and spring treatments may be more successful. Genetic fingerprinting of mature A. luehmannii and C. pauper trees in six populations did not identify any clonal individuals indicating that recruitment in the past has been from seedlings. Despite this, the high level of gene flow suggests that the impact of introducing small numbers of root suckers into existing populations is unlikely to impact negatively on the population genetics of these species.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Restoration</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual Art: evoking the numinous using a 3D computer game engine</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Christopher .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">A desire to more fully understand the impact of altered states of spiritual health on the general health of patients has been a focus of recent research activity. Studies have explored the meaning of spirituality held by patients and nurses, the spiritual needs of patients, and methods of providing spiritual care in nursing. However, few studies have investigated nurses&#8217; own spiritual health and the significance this may have on the provision of holistic nursing care. The aim of this study, therefore, was to inform nursing regarding the spiritual health of nurses and the influence that nurses&#8217; own spiritual health has on their ability to provide holistic nursing care to their patients. The study was conducted in two phases using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Phase one consisted of a survey of Division 1 nurses currently employed in the Grampians region of Victoria to describe key dimensions of their spiritual health. This survey provided biographical data and, through the use of the &#8220;Shalom Measure of Spiritual Health&#8221;, discovered the ideal of spiritual health held by nurses as well as the nurses&#8217; perception of patient needs pertaining to the achievement of spiritual health. Phase two utilised Naturalistic Inquiry to further explore the meaning of spirituality and spiritual health held by nurses, and the methods of achieving these for nurses and patients. The findings revealed that although nurses perceive the spiritual dimension of patient care to be important, they feel ill-equipped to provide this aspect of care. In addition, the major support for nurses, who themselves experience spiritual distress whilst at work, comes from colleagues. Further, prevailing health care systems in place do not always lend themselves to holistic approaches to care. This study identifies the need for nurse education to redress the clearly inadequate preparation nurses are given for this aspect of their role. Health care policy-makers and administrators also have a responsibility to consider all dimensions of care when designing and implementing health care guidelines and systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holistic nursing</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Spiritual health</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generalist telephone counselling and referral call data as a social indicator : a lifeline to social support?</field><field name="creator">Watson, Robert . University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">The aim of this Australian Research Council Linkage doctoral project with industry partners UnitingCare-Lifeline Ballarat and Lifeline Australia was to investigate whether calls to Lifeline &#8211; a generalist telephone counselling and referral service &#8211; could be used as valid and reliable social indicators of health. The Lifeline Australia service receives approximately 1,000 calls a day and key details of each call are recorded on its Client Services Management Information System (CSMIS). A number of research questions directed this study: (1) What are the characteristics or attributes of callers to Lifeline?; (2) How do the patterns of calls to Lifeline vary spatially?; and (3) What is the statistical relationship between calls to Lifeline and other measures of community health? This thesis presents a detailed descriptive summary and analysis of Lifeline&#8217;s national CSMIS call data (N = 90,128 cases) from 01-04-2003 to 29-06-2003. It explores this and other sources of call data, such as the Telstra Exchange data, for their potential to be used as social indicators. The project created a model of generalist telephone counselling and referral use (MGTCRU). The MGTCRU was used as a theoretical base to a call rate indicator, named the Lifeline Indicator of Social Need (LISN), which reflects the community&#8217;s capacity to provide social support to its most socially isolated residents. The LISN was found to have useful attributes and a potential for use as a social indicator of community strength. The call rate indicator showed a statistically significant relationship with the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia, measures of socio-economic disadvantage, and suicide rates. However, the CSMIS database was found to have certain limitations. The thesis presents recommendations for this situation to be addressed. While acknowledging that there are limitations to telephone counselling call data it is clear that these call data can be used to create cost effective, rapid, reliable, and potentially valid social indicators. This thesis has made a number of significant empirical and theoretical contributions to knowledge on telephone counselling and referral. The descriptive summary of the CSMIS data provided in this thesis might be used in innovative ways by social researchers. The LISN could be used on its own or included in other social indices. The MGTCRU provides a theoretical framework for understanding telephone counselling and referral services use and may assist these services to organise their operations and meet the needs of their callers. This project may have particular application to a current upgrade of Lifeline Australia&#8217;s telephony and call data systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counseling</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Social service</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sun-moths (lepidoptera: castniidae) of Victoria, with a detailed study of the pale sun-moth (Synemon selene klug, 1850)</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Fabian . University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">The sun-moths (family Castniidae) are a distinctive group of monocot-feeding diurnal Lepidoptera that contains a high proportion of threatened species worldwide. Seven of the eight Victorian Synemon species are considered as threatened. This study has determined through extensive fieldwork that most of these species are now restricted to very small remnants of their particular habitats. These findings have been integrated into a review of the current distribution, biology and habitat requirements of all the Victorian species. This has enabled recommendations for their long-term conservation and management to be made. Special attention was paid to the Pale Sun-moth (Synemon selene Klug, 1850) because it appeared to be nationally endangered and without a government strategy for its conservation. Also, there was strong circumstantial evidence of complete parthenogenesis within all of its Victorian populations. The Victorian occurrences are shown to be parthenogenetic, although specimens of both sexes are known from a ?now-extinct population near Two Wells, South Australia. It was also established that these parthenogenetic populations include five distinct morphs, two or three of which occur sympatrically at four localities in the Wimmera area. Parthenogenetic populations of these morphs cannot interbreed, this potentially restricting their genetic diversity. The extent of genetic diversity was examined with all parthenogenetic Victorian morphs of S. selene. DNA sequencing of 1515 bp of the COI gene revealed a maximum divergence level of 12 bp between some of the morphs and 1 to 2 bp within some morphs. This level of genetic diversity implies that these morphs have continued to evolve in the absence of males through time. This study has highlighted the special academic interest of S. selene and the urgent need for its adequate conservation. Some important directions for future research on the species are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Window on an era : Geelong : a post-industrial city</field><field name="creator">McNeice, Kelly .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I have researched what I believe is the powerful, catalytic effect of poetry on the creative work of some artists. I have chosen three, Australian painters; Sidney Nolan, James Gleeson and Brett Whiteley. I have looked carefully at how the works of various poets have influenced and inspired these artists. I have put forward the idea that this engagement with the poetic realm has greatly enhanced the artist&#8217;s creative form-making. Indeed these artists have acknowledged their strong links with the world of poetry. I have touched very briefly on the ideas of some renowned philosophers who stress society&#8217;s need for fine works of art. In my opinion great works of art can come from this linking of painting with poetry and therefore, this nexus is to be encouraged. I have in my own painterly works looked to the poets for inspiration. In The Wimmera Series of landscape works, I read Brian Edwards&#8217; and Homer Reith&#8217;s poetry, and found in their imagery a rich source of creative ideas. I continued to read the works of the poets and found that the poetry of Ezra Pound, Dante Alighieri, Judith Wright and the works of many others, were an inspirational and catalytic force. I have also discovered on this artistic journey that the very writing of poetry, my own attempts in this field, seemed to bring to my painting, a sharper, a more analytical and critical focus. Renowned art critics and art historians have criticised contemporary art for its lack of the poetic, and its boring shallowness. I would urge artists to engage with the poetic realm, and this interplay between painting and poetry, may produce fine works of lasting greatness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-linear analogues of Lagrange functions in constrained optimization</field><field name="creator">Giri, Jason .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">The high rates of depression and suicide among older adults have given rise to research which aims to identify factors that protect older people from mental illness. Recently, Bailey and McLaren (2005) developed and tested a model which investigated the relationships between engagement in various leisure activities performed alone or with others, sense of belonging, depression, and suicidal ideation. The present study examined an extended version of the mental health model, incorporating the additional variables of perceived freedom in leisure and physical health status. A sample of Australian males and females (N = 379) aged 65 years and over (M age = 77.23, SD = 7.48) completed the Perceived Freedom in Leisure Questionnaire, the Yale Physical Activity Survey,the Duke Health Profile, the Sense of Belonging Instrument, the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depressive Scale, and the Suicide Subscale of the General Health Questionnaire. Results indicated that the model was invariant for gender, and accounted for 56% of the variance in suicidal ideation. The model indicated that physical health had direct relationships with each variable in the model. Perceived freedom in leisure predicted engagement in physical activity, sense of belonging-antecedent, and depression, whereas sense of belonging psychological state predicted depression and suicidal ideation. Results suggest that interventions aimed at improving older adults&#8217; perceptions of freedom and personal choice with regard to their leisure experiences, maintaining optimal health, and increasing opportunities to foster feelings of belonging and relatedness with others, should protect against the development of mental ill health.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clinical psychology</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Suicide</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of glycerol hyperhydration on run performance within an Olympic distance triathlon</field><field name="creator">Van Ewyk, Gerald . University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">This study was designed to determine the impact of glycerol hyperhydration, compared with a placebo hyperhydration, on the run performance during an Olympic distance triathlon. Ten competitive triathletes (mean peak oxygen consumption, VO2 peak = 65.5 &#177; 5.5 ml.kg.-1min-1) undertook two simulated Olympic Distance Triathlons in 31&#176; C and 61% relative humidity. The trials were split into two work phases: a fixed workload phase comprising a 18-20 min swim and a 60 min cycle and, a self regulated time trial run over 10 kilometres conducted on a treadmill. One hundred and fifty min prior each trial, either a glycerol solution (1 g.kg.-1 body mass (BM) in a 4% carbohydrate &#8211; electrolyte drink) or a placebo of equal volume of the 4% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution was ingested over one hour. The total fluid intake in each trial was 23 ml.kg.-1 BM. A randomised, double blind, cross over design was used. Due to either 1) the arduous nature of the trials 2) the side effects associated with the ingestion of glycerol 3) or the combination of the two aforementioned reasons, only five of the 10 subjects completed the final 10 km self regulated time trial for both treatments. Only the data obtained from these five subjects were reported in this study. Glycerol ingestion expanded body water over the placebo by 154 ml (26%). At 60 and 90 min after the start of drinking, urine output was significantly higher with glycerol than placebo treatment (216.4, 366.4 ml vs 81.0, 242.0 ml, respectively) but significantly higher at 120 min in the placebo (421.6 ml vs 131.2 ml). There were no significant differences in heart rate and rectal temperature during the swim and cycle phases. However, there were significant increases in heart rate (at 5, 10, 15, 25 and 30 min) and rectal temperature (at 5, 20 and 30 min) during the 10 km run in the glycerol trial. The mean 10 km run time for the placebo trial was 40 min 21 sec (&#177; 2.9 min) while the glycerol trial was 39 min 22 sec (&#177; 2.0 min). The mean difference of 2.1% in finishing time between trials was not significant. Three of the five subjects in the glycerol trial improved their 10 km time by 7.0, 2.4 and 2.7%, respectively. The finishing time for one subject did not change for both trials while another subject had deteriorated by 2.3% in the glycerol trial. In the glycerol treatment, five subjects complained of bloating and nausea while only one subject complained of feeling unwell in the placebo treatment. Data from this study have shown that glycerol hyperhydration did not significantly improve performance while plasma volume expansion and subsequent lower rectal temperature and lower heart rates were not evident. The exact mechanisms of how glycerol hyperhydration can improve performance warrant further investigation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water-electrolyte balance</field><field name="subject">Triathlon</field><field name="subject">Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Athletes</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Underwater kicking following the freestyle tumble-turn</field><field name="creator">Clothier, Peter . University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Swim turns are a component of competitive swimming where considerable advantage can be gained or lost. This thesis investigates underwater dolphin and flutter kicking techniques and their application to exits following the turn in freestyle swimming. Five separate investigations were conducted to examine the kinetics and kinematics of each underwater kicking technique and are presented in expanded journal manuscript form. Studies one, two and three involved the comparison of freestyle turns when using flutter and dolphin kicking wall exit techniques. The results obtained indicated that freestyle turns using flutter kicking were faster than dolphin kicking in age-group swimmers. For this group, significant and equal improvements were made to flutter and dolphin kick turn performances following six weeks of dolphin kick and dolphin kick turn training. However, no difference in turn times were observed between kicking conditions by older and more highly skilled swimmers. Study four involved a kinematical comparison of maximal underwater free-swimming dolphin and flutter kicking. Results showed dolphin kick to be a superior underwater free-swimming technique. Greater foot width, increased ankle range of movement and greater vertical displacement of the ankle and foot during kicking were shown to be highly predictive of faster underwater dolphin kicking. Investigation five compared the drag forces and kinematics between the dolphin and flutter kicking techniques while subjects were towed at velocities representing those experienced following wall turn push-off. Results favour the dolphin kick as a superior underwater technique at these higher velocities. Increased underwater dolphin kicking efficiency, as measured by decreased net towing force, was found to be associated with larger kick amplitude &#8211; rate ratios, and higher kick amplitude &#8211; streamline length ratios.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swimming</field><field name="subject">Starts and turns</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sexual Beliefs, Attitudes And Script Of Men Convicted Of Sexual Offences Against Children: An Empirical Investigation</field><field name="creator">Owen, Karen</field><field name="description">Community concern about sexual offending places continued pressure on correctional services to refine treatment and reduce re-offending. While cognitive processes have been identified as a key element in the development and maintenance of sexual offending, more research on the precise nature of these processes is required. The current study, based on Ward and Siegert&#8217;s Pathways Model, involved 100 male offenders of various types: 25 intra &#8211; familial sex offenders against children, 25 extra-familial sex offenders against children, 25 sex offenders who chose adult victims, and 25 convicted of non-sexual offences. There was also a control group of 25 non-offenders. The quantitative data, derived from a series of questionnaires concerning childhood and sexual experiences, provided evidence that the two types of child sex offender differed from the other groups with respect to their expectations of sexual behaviour among children, their experience of sexual abuse and neglect as children themselves, and, paradoxically, their current high self-esteem. In addition, scripts relating to hypothetical consenting adult sexual relations and sexual contact with a child were collected from the 50 sex offenders against children. The script content suggested that, compared with intra - familial offenders, extra-familial offenders had notably unrealistic, na&#239;ve and romanticised scripts for adult relationships and more sophisticated scripts for offences against children. The latter suggested that scripts might serve as a mediating function in offending behaviour and that offenders acquired a degree of task domain expertise. Despite some inherent problems undertaking research with the sex-offender population, the findings confirmed that sex-offenders do not constitute a homogenous group and that the pathways model offers a unique perspective on how males become and develop their capacity as sex-offenders, how they sustain a positive view of themselves, and how they continue to commit offences. Finally, the model was considered in terms of its capacity to suggest ways to better target treatment efforts to specific groups of sexual offenders to further reduce their rate of recidivism</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classification of HTML Documents</field><field name="creator">Xie, Wei . University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Text Classification is the task of mapping a document into one or more classes based on the presence or absence of words (or features) in the document. It is intensively being studied and different classification techniques and algorithms have been developed. This thesis focuses on classification of online documents that has become more critical with the development of World Wide Web. The WWW vastly increases the availability of on-line documents in digital format and has highlighted the need to classify them. From this background, we have noted the emergence of &#8220;automatic Web Classification&#8221;. These mainly concentrate on classifying HTML-like documents into classes or categories by not only using the methods that are inherited from the traditional Text Classification process, but also utilizing the extra information provided only by Web pages. Our work is based on the fact that, Web documents, contain not only ordinary features (words) but also extra information, such as meta-data and hyperlinks that can be used to advantage the classification process. The aim of this research is to study various ways of using the extra information, in particularly, hyperlink information provided by HTML-documents (Web pages). The merit of the approach, developed in this thesis, is its simplicity, compared with existing approaches. We present different approaches of using hyperlink information to improve the effectiveness of web classification. Unlike other work in this area, we will only use the mappings between linked documents and their own class or classes. In this case, we only need to add a few features called linked-class features into the datasets, and then apply classifiers on them for classification. In the numerical experiments we adopted two wellknown Text Classification algorithms, Support Vector Machines and BoosTexter. The results obtained show that classification accuracy can be improved by using mixtures of ordinary and linked-class features. Moreover, out-links usually work better than in-links in classification. We also analyse and discuss the reasons behind this improvement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HTML</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Support Vector Machines</field><field name="subject">BoosTexter</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Littoral macroinverterbrates in relation to native and exotic riparian vegetation in streams of central Victoria, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jayawardana, Chandamali .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">The Enhanced Primary Care Package aimed to improve health and quality of life through enhancing primary health care for those over 75 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders over 55 years and those with chronic conditions and multidisciplinary needs. A multi-level approach was implemented to promote the package. West Vic Division of General Practice conducted the General Practice Education Support and Community Linkages implementation program for the package in Western Victoria and focused on health assessments for those over 75 years. This research investigated what factors affected change in rural general practitioner practice through surveying general practitioners and collecting Health Insurance Commission data prior to and following the program. Patients were also interviewed to determine acceptance of health assessments and nurse involvement. The program increased awareness, but had little effect on increasing uptake, as only 53% of general practitioners began undertaking health assessments. However the general practitioners indicated an increased frequency of health assessment prescription. Health Insurance Commission data suggested an immediate increase in the use of the assessments, however the rate fluctuated and then declined. Lack of sustained uptake of the program was not associated with remuneration, as 77% of general practitioners did not regard finance as a barrier. Respondents&#8217; major barrier was time (40% pre-education, 73% post-education). This data reflected a rural environment where general practitioners face competing priorities, time constraints, workforce shortage and long consultation lists. A notable change did however occur from practice nurse employment as the involvement of a practice nurse generally resulted in patient satisfaction with the assessment. It was apparent that a complex multifaceted and longer-term view is needed to address factors which limit rural general practitioners&#8217; ability to change. This needs to be addressed at the Commonwealth level and not in isolation in order to produce an integrated framework to enhance and promote, rather than demand change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicare</field><field name="subject">Insurance</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of multiple perspectives and knowledge in adverse drug reaction decision-making : Volume 1</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Michelle . University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Injury and illness associated with drugs are major problems in Australia and around the world, despite significant developments in the area of adverse drug reaction (ADR) decision support technology. The aims of this thesis are: to investigate the ADR decision domain; to determine factors that may assist in the prevention, detection and management of ADRs; and, to inform the pre-requirements analysis phase of the development of decision support systems. An approach has been taken that permits open and grounded study of the decision environment. This approach can then be used to frame and inform the design of an ADR decision support system. Fifteen case studies that comprise self selected consumers, the treating medical practitioner/s and expert perspectives of a single instance of an ADR (fifteen in-depth consumer interviews, eight in-depth medical practitioner interviews and 30 expert written questionnaires), have been collected and analysed using a grounded theory approach, a symbolic interactionist theoretical framework and a social constructionist epistemology. The analysis was performed from three perspectives: individual case study analysis (all interviews for an instance of an ADR); group analysis (consumer, medical practitioner and expert views) and analysis combining the individual case studies and groups of data. Concepts, themes and theory have emerged from these data in the following areas: &#8226; the contribution of the differences in understanding of the core concepts within this domain, to misunderstandings between decision-makers; &#8226; the consumer as a diagnostic decision-maker in the ADR decision domain; &#8226; differential diagnostic strategies used by the consumers and medical practitioners; &#8226; complexities in the ADR decision domain that make diagnosis difficult; &#8226; the role of ADR information in consumer and medical practitioner decision-making; &#8226; decision types used by consumers and medical practitioners in the ADR decision domain; &#8226; resources used by consumers, medical practitioners and experts to inform their ADR decisions; &#8226; decision-making with partial knowledge of the consumer case history, drug behaviour and diseases; &#8226; the impact of suspected ADRs on consumers and on future decision-making; &#8226; medical practitioner/consumer decision-making models; and, &#8226; reasons for low ADR reporting and the impact on the development of new ADR knowledge. The results above suggest the following: &#8226; The ADR decision domain is more complex than the current ADR decision support focus and that broadening this focus may assist in providing a more complete and useful decision support solution. &#8226; Improving the prevention, detection and management of ADRs requires more than providing prescribers with up to date ADR information. Other important factors are sharing of information, awareness of the role of the consumer, a collaborative approach between the consumers and medical practitioners, and generation of new ADR knowledge. &#8226; A grounded theory analysis of case study data using the theoretical perspectives of social constructionism and symbolic interactionism provided insight into this domain from the perspectives of multiple decision-makers. This may be an approach that can be used by systems analysts to inform the requirements analysis phases of decision support within other domains. The results of this qualitative work are preliminary. Future work is required to confirm and expand these results.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drugs</field><field name="subject">Side effects</field><field name="subject">Pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The floristic composition and regeneration characteristics of Buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii) woodland of the Wimmera, Victoria</field><field name="creator">Macaulay, Lisa Ann .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how women, as agents of change, contest the male-dominated structures at the organisational and practitioner levels of rural medicine in Australia. The premises for this study are that females now outnumber males as medical graduates and general practice trainees, yet women are significantly less likely than men to occupy rural and remote practice positions in Australia. Furthermore, the organisation of medicine remains strongly patriarchal. A feminist qualitative design underpins this empirical study involving: in-depth interviews with seventeen women activists and thirteen rural women general practitioners; grounded theory analysis of transcribed interviews; and interpretation of findings through a feminist poststructural lens. Findings uncover the gendered organisational and practitioner environment through which change is negotiated. At the organisational level, male exclusionary practices &#8211; played out through the &#8216;male as norm&#8217; and the &#8216;problem is women&#8217; discourses &#8211; position women in highly contradictory ways and marginalise their voices. Yet simultaneously, activists are challenging entrenched interests through individual and collective strategies of change which include: initiating gender-awareness projects; claiming legitimacy by using male-centred tactics and women-defined discourses; developing female-friendly initiatives; and mentoring of and building alliances between women. At the practitioner level, results reveal how women&#8217;s everyday lives as rural general practitioners are shaped by oppositional tensions. However, beyond the struggle of &#8216;fitting in&#8217;, women are altering rural medicine by (re)shaping meanings and (re)constructing work practices. Furthermore, their narratives suggest that rural spaces are integral to ways women carve out women-defined practice. A key innovation of this thesis is analysis of change at dual levels, both organisational and practitioner. This thesis marks a significant advancement upon the usual themes that attend only to the marginalisation of women and rural areas. It highlights the transformative process through which women (re)create the discursive spaces of rural general practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physicians</field><field name="subject">Rural health services</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of commuting status upon community involvement of professionals in rural North West Victoria</field><field name="creator">Devers, Deanna .

Quantitative data, which was gathered via a mail-out questionnaire (response = 54 per cent) that was issued to 1,040 occupationally diverse professionals who worked in fourteen towns throughout north-western Victoria, was analysed to determine whether commuting and non-commuting professionals differed significantly in their community involvement. To explain why certain relationships emerged from survey analysis, face-toface interviews were subsequently undertaken with 24 questionnaire respondents. The key finding of this study is that there is a significant relationship between commuting status and the retention of rural professionals.

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) have become a major success in telecommunications during the last few years, due to advantages such as mobility, flexibility, and easier maintenance. A device called an access point (AP) acts as a base station in WLAN for connecting a group of users to the network via radio signal. During the planning of such a network an important problem is to determine the optimal number of these devices and their placement/distribution so that coverage, capacity, and physical security are maximised at minimum cost. In this thesis we are using continuous optimisation techniques to optimise the number of APs and their distribution while cost of deployment is reduced and physical security of the network is enhanced. To find the number and placement of APs, we developed a multi-objective functions model based on path losses and power for free space environments. The two functions in the models are combined by using a balancing parameter. Since it is recognised that some of the objectives can be handled one at a time, in another approach, we followed a step-by-step procedure. We start with a novel optimisation model based on path losses for indoor environments including obstacles. Cost of deployment is saved by finding the minimum number of APs ensuring that the path loss at each test point/receiver is below the given maximum path loss. Next, the physical security of the network is enhanced by placing the APs far from places accessible to unauthorised users to reduce the risk of intrusion into the network. This is achieved in the framework of the model by introducing potential unauthorised users in unauthorised areas for whom coverage is minimised. Due to the presence of obstacles in indoor buildings, the path loss function is discontinuous. Therefore, the objective functions are very complicated and most of the existing optimisation algorithms cannot be applied to solve the problem. We use a global optimisation algorithm that is not used by other researchers to solve the same problem. To validate the accuracy of the optimisation model and performance of the numerical methods, we run tests on several indoor buildings and use wide range of WLAN parameters. The results demonstrate the quality of our model and algorithm. Based on the proposed model and algorithm, we developed a software to assist the network designers in planning wireless LANs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless LANs</field><field name="subject">Network analysis</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'And for harmony most ardently we long' : musical life in Ballarat, 1851-1871</field><field name="creator">Doggett, Anne .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">"This project has, for its central component, an epic poem, 'A locale of the cosmos'. The accompanying exegesis examines epic as an ancient, but continually evolving form. It argues that, as a contemporary example of the genre and, as a sustained poetic rumination on landscape and memory, 'A locale of the cosmos' represents a significant development within the modern tradition of autobiographical epic. In broader terms, 'A locale of the cosmos' privileges the landscape and history of a region of Australia, the Wimmera region of north-western Victoria and, in doing so, explores the cumulative effects of the physical environment as a site for sustained poetic treatment. The poem is, therefore, an epic of both historical narrative and philosophical reflection, giving meaning to and interpreting ideas of space, place and locale. "Furthermore, it explores, in particular, the psychological and spiritual effects of vast horizontal distances, created by a landscape in which endless plains and immense horizons form an analogue of the wider cosmos. The poem's themes, therefore, bear not only on the prominences of the visible locale, but also explore the salients of an interior world, a landscape of the mind to which the poetry gives shape and meaning."</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epic poetry</field><field name="subject">Wimmera</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progress in Australia over the 20th century : the ups, downs and reversals that occurred in Australian human wellbeing over the 20th century</field><field name="creator">Gathercole, Michael .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">The cost of adverse drug reactions to society in the form of deaths, chronic illness, foetal malformation, and many other effects is quite significant. For example, in the United States of America, adverse reactions to prescribed drugs is around the fourth leading cause of death. The reporting of adverse drug reactions is spontaneous and voluntary in Australia. Many methods that have been used for the analysis of adverse drug reaction data, mostly using a statistical approach as a basis for clinical analysis in drug safety surveillance decision support. This thesis examines new approaches that may be used in the analysis of drug safety data. These methods differ significantly from the statistical methods in that they utilize co variability methods of association to define drug-reaction relationships. Co variability algorithms were developed in collaboration with Musa Mammadov to discover drugs associated with adverse reactions and possible drug-drug interactions. This method uses the system organ class (SOC) classification in the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC) data to stratify reactions. The text categorization algorithm BoosTexter was found to work with the same drug safety data and its performance and modus operandi was compared to our algorithms. These alternative methods were compared to a standard disproportionality analysis methods for signal detection in drug safety data including the Bayesean mulit-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), which was found to have a problem with similar reaction terms in a report and innocent by-stander drugs. A classification of drug terms was made using the anatomical-therapeutic-chemical classification (ATC) codes. This reduced the number of drug variables from 5081 drug terms to 14 main drug classes. The ATC classification is structured into a hierarchy of five levels. Exploitation of the ATC hierarchy allows the drug safety data to be stratified in such a way as to make them accessible to powerful existing tools. A data mining method that uses association rules, which groups them on the basis of content, was used as a basis for applying the ATC and SOC ontologies to ADRAC data. This allows different views of these associations (even very rare ones). A signal detection method was developed using these association rules, which also incorporates critical reaction terms.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Drug reactions</field><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Signal detection methods</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into Spring Water</field><field name="creator">Purtill, Marie .

As a non&#8211;Indigenous Australian migrant, my knowledge of Indigenous Australian spiritual and cultural matters was limited, as was knowledge of Indigenous Australian history, both pre- and post-European settlement. As a migrant, I have many memories and experiences of spring water at European wells, springs and places of pilgrimage where healing, both physical and spiritual was sought. In childhood, I enjoyed reading the many myths and legends that surround the magical, mysterious and often invisible resource of spring water. Realising that my current knowledge of spring water relied more on folklore and anecdotal information than on fact, I decided that the topic of spring water offered worthwhile opportunities for research. [...] The availability of spring water is being challenged on more than one front. This research explores and investigates the abundance of (particularly) art references to spring water in Indigenous Australian culture and traditions, while noting the dearth of art references relating specifically to spring water in non-Indigenous Australian culture; although an abundance of art references to water in general is revealed. In the latter context, references to art depicting aspects of the hydrologic cycle have been substituted and explored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community response to shading a Phragmites australis reedbed</field><field name="creator">Colville, Sonia .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Safety culture has risen to prominence over the past two decades as a means by which organisations may enhance their safety performance. Safety culture may be conceptualised as an interpretive device that mediates between organisational safety rhetoric and safety programs on the one hand, and local workplace cultures on the other. More recently, risk-awareness has emerged as a cultural approach to safety. Front line workers are encouraged to become risk-aware through programs designed to prompt them to undertake mental or informal risk assessments before commencing work. The problem is that risk-awareness programs have not been the subject of systematic research and the impact of these programs on the culture of safety and the resultant level of risk is unknown. Therefore, this ethnographic study of two sites within a large contract maintenance organisation in Australia explored what impact risk-awareness programs have upon the culture of safety and the resultant level of risk. The researcher spent two months in the field and data was collected through participant observation, semistructured interviews and through a review of organisational documents. This study found that managers focused upon collecting the paperwork associated with the program as proof that workers had a safer workplace, whereas workers preferred to rely upon their common sense rather than the paperwork to keep them safe. As a consequence, the riskawareness program resulted in a culture of paperwork and varying levels of risk reduction because the paperwork associated with the program created an illusion of safety for managers as much as common sense did for workers. The results of this study have implications for safety culture, risk-awareness programs and for organisational learning. They also have implications for organisations wishing to improve their safety culture by encouraging risk-awareness in front-line workers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial safety</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Risk perception</field><field name="subject">Safety management</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiculturalism : (re) intellectualising teaching</field><field name="creator">Edmonds, George .

I have cast a line of inquiry into eastern, western and primitive art practices, observing the journey of chance accelerated by developments in technology. Traditionally artists utilized modes of spatial convention and techniques according to the specific cultural traditions of the time and place of their production. By contrast, contemporary artists know no such boundaries, and are able to select from a range of spatial options relevant both to current forms of expression and to a personal visual language. My own art practice has been enriched and extended, increasing my ability to challenge the notion of still life composition by reversing the traditional hierarchy of form and space through the application of a series of experiments brought about by extensive research into this spatial evolution.

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Whilst the notion of the &#8216;Reflective Space&#8217; could arguably encompass many conceptual positions and propositions, for the purposes of this research investigation the &#8216;Reflective Space&#8217; referred to in the title of this exegesis will focus upon what I consider as an emerging and growing consciousness of the natural world. As a theoretical and conceptual construct, the investigation considers how this growing consciousness can be seen to be expressed through the medium of representations of the Australian landscape. This work considers a number of contemporary theoretical positions and a number of relevant social and political questions; it also acknowledges that within such spheres of reflection, the issue of being sustainable in relation to our interactions and perceptions of this natural world looms as perhaps one of the most pressing of our time. While it will be acknowledged that the depiction of landscape enjoys a long-standing tradition within the Australian cultural mind, the suggestion will be made that certain aspects of these visualisations can be seen to be &#8216;reflective&#8217; of a visual, cultural and physical degradation, and indeed even an apprehension of the physical &#8216;space&#8217; that is represented as landscape. The investigation considers and reflects upon what can be observed as contentious and ambivalent attitudes expressed towards landscape perceived through works of art. Strategies for adopting a perceptual visual ethic grounded within the concepts and principles of sustainability will be presented for consideration. By applying such modes of interpretation to perceptions of land and landscape depiction, new appreciations for the cultural &#8216;space&#8217; that is landscape will be developed. Such understandings will consider and reflect upon the temporal nature of our natural world. The thesis is this: that to be able to think and act in a sustainable fashion in relation to our environment, our perceptions and interpretations of visualisations of landscape must include a recognition that the land is a &#8216;temporal&#8217; space, in which past and possible futures are immanent in the present.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Program behaviour modelling with flexible logical entity abstraction</field><field name="creator">Andrews, David .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Traditional financial theories see capital structure as a result of mainly financial, tax and growth factors (Modigliani &amp; Miller, 1958). But corporate governance theories (Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976) and business strategy theories (Barton &amp; Gordon, 1988) suggest that ownership structure and ownership concentration, product diversification and asset specificity may also influence capital structure. Focusing on the examination of the determinants of capital structure in Chinese listed companies, this research goes beyond financial factors and considered business strategy and corporate governance approaches, and their impact on capital structure, in a transitioning Chinese context where institutions, expertise and regulatory processes are different to, but converging on, Western approaches. A panel data set of 1,098 Chinese listed companies for the period of 1991 to 2000 was collected from published sources, and conventional and innovative econometric methodologies were used to model a range of relationships between capital structure and its financial and non-financial determinants. The statistical approaches used in this study included Ordinary Least Squares Model and also Linear Mixed Model, which is a powerful tool to examine panel data where independence of explanatory variables is not assumed. The analysis also involved Hox&#8217;s model building procedures to measure model fit. The capital structure of listed companies in both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Securities Exchange is positively related to a firm&#8217;s tax rate, growth and capital intensity and negatively related to a firm&#8217;s profit and size. Other financial factors such as tangibility, risk and duration are non-significant. The capital structure of listed companies, particularly in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, is positively related to product diversification and negatively related to asset specificity. The capital structure of listed companies in the Shanghai Securities Exchange is positively related to government ownership and ownership concentration of the largest shareholder and negatively related to legal person ownership and ownership concentration of the ten largest shareholders. The data and modelling support financial and non-financial determinants of capital structure. In particular, information asymmetry, business diversity and asset specificity have a significant impact on capital structure. In addition the empirical work in the study supports agency cost explanations of debt and equity. Finally the research demonstrates that the two main financial markets in China, Shenzhen and Shanghai, have operated differently but are converging towards a common norm. The research contributes to the general field of capital structure and provides valuable insights into the nature of the Chinese firm and the evolution of the Chinese financial system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Corporations</field><field name="subject">Finance</field><field name="subject">Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/12728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conducting suicide research in Australia in relation to the operation of themes Research Ethics Committees</field><field name="creator">Macgill, Jennifer .

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Work/life balance researchers have documented the low take-up rates of corporate work/life balance policies at the same time as there are reports of persistent work/life pressures. This research aims to provide more comprehensive explanations of the phenomenon of low policy take-up than those currently available in the work/life balance literature which focus on organisational and individual factors. The research project is based on a critical review of the work/life balance literature which focuses on organisational solutions and starts from the assumption that the organisational approach to researching and addressing work/life conflicts is inherently limited, mainly because it does not theorise gender as a social structure and does not take into consideration the social and political context in which work/life arrangements are negotiated but focuses, instead, on individual employees and organisations. I integrated my critical review of the organisational work/life balance literature with concepts in the feminist literature, most importantly the gendered public/private divide, to create an explicit &#8216;gender lens&#8217; which guides the interpretations of my findings. I applied this gender lens to Habermas&#8217; model of societal evolution to operationalise it as an analytical tool for this research. From this theoretical basis, I designed a comparative research project, using Australia and Sweden as country case studies, which compares the approaches to work/life balance in the two countries. The focus of the analysis is on parental leave as one important example of work/life balance policies. The data for this research includes the parental leave legislation, public documents released by governments and associated bodies as well as national surveys on the take-up of parental leave provisions in both countries. This material is analysed in the light of the conceptual framework.

The introduction of a secular education system in Victoria, together with enthusiasm among producers for technological innovation and skill development, led to changes in the nature and conditions of paid work, as well as to a push among workers and their sympathizers for greater appreciation of past contributions by older workers and the needs of the ill and/or incapacitated.

University of Ballarat.</field><field name="description">Western research dominates in areas of theories and models which describe organisational behaviours, human resource management and workplace participation. However the 21st century brings new challenges. Findings to-date suggest that attitudes and values are strongly culture specific therefore many facets now require re-thinking by human resource specialists and organisational behavioural theorists. For instance, the globalisation of the market economy has dramatically changed the contemporary business environment. As a direct consequence of the globalisation process, the nature of organisational structures and workforce diversity has also changed. Such changes may make the application of Western theories less relevant to explain behaviours and attitudes of contemporary employees around the world. Therefore, there is a need for expanding our cross-cultural understanding in order to provide practical knowledge to enhance people and business management so that organisations can remain successful nationally and internationally. Comparative cross-cultural studies are required to expand on Western theories and models. The present study acknowledged and regarded the importance of cross-cultural studies to date, and endeavoured to expand on the extant knowledge by providing specific information relating to two diverse countries. The aim of the research project is to examine two measurable areas of organisational behaviours namely leadership styles and managerial career aspirations of female and male managers in Malaysia and Australia to explore the similarities and differences between the groups. The study found differences within and between female and male managers in Malaysia and Australia in terms of leadership styles, perception of effectiveness, perceptions towards managerial career aspirations and perceived promotion opportunities during the quantitative and qualitative data collection stages. The study concludes by providing empirical evidence to refute the universality of Western theories and models in all cultures. The analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data revealed significant differences in terms of values, behaviours and attitudes of managers in the two diverse cultures which have important implications for work and employment. This suggests that Western theories and models of organisational behaviour and workplace participation are not universally applicable, appropriate or relevant in all cultural environments. Implications for theory and practice in the light of an enhanced cross-cultural understanding were recommended.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career development</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/2117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sleep, Sister</field><field name="creator">Breen, Karen</field><field name="description">This submission is in two parts.

The second and main part of this submission is the first draft of a novel, Sleep, Sister, which I have written over the course of the last year.  The exegesis explores issues such as the history of the road novel, alienation and loneliness within society, and in particular within families. It also discusses the novel as a coming of age story, with its main characters being members of Generation X, those born between 1960 -1980. This was the first generation of New Zealand children for whom divorced parents and blended families were common experiences. The exegesis also describes how the themes of the story have informed the style, narrative and characterisation of the book. It concludes with the main question of the novel; whether the two main characters &#8211; sisters &#8211; can overcome their damaging past.  The novel is set in New Zealand, predominantly in the year 1987, although there are flashbacks to the girls&#8217; 1970s childhood.

When they meet Sam is cynical about university, dedicated to sports and to his drinking companions, but unresolved in almost all other areas of his life. He desperately wants to free himself from the well-to-do St Heliers home where he still lives with his parents, and move out into the world with a more secure set of values and ambitions. He has liberal ideas, bordering at times on Socialist, fuelled by the political events of the day, but not yet translated into any actions.

Despite this, wrack removal from sandy beaches is a widespread and increasingly common practice globally, and there is little information regarding the ecological effects of such wrack removal on sandy beaches. The aim of this thesis was to establish the ecological importance of wrack in South Australian (SA) sandy-beach ecosystems. As a first step in furthering our understanding of the effects of wrack removal, I aimed to assess the importance of wrack, independent of the effects of wrack removal. The second over-riding aim of this thesis was to assess the ecological effects of wrack removal on aspects of these systems. 

To date, the methods used for quantifying the size of wrack deposits on sandy beaches have had limited use due to the time and expertise required to conduct thorough sampling. In Chapter 2, I thus tested the accuracy of a rapid &#147;photopoint&#148; method to visually estimate percentage wrack cover as well as provide an archived record. Comparisons of results obtained from conventional transects with those from photopoints indicated that the photopoint technique can be used to rapidly and accurately estimate % wrack cover on sandy beaches. The photopoint method has a wide range of potential applications and represents a valuable advance in the field. 

Currently our knowledge of the amounts and types of wrack on SA shores is limited, despite these accumulations being a feature of some SA beaches. Wrack deposits in three biogeographical regions of SA were thus repeatedly surveyed to assess spatial (between and within regions) and temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variation (Chapter 2). Both wrack cover and the composition of wrack deposits varied spatially and temporally. Wrack deposits contained a diverse array of seagrass, algal, other biotic materials and anthropogenic debris. The South East region of SA had distinctly-different wrack deposits compared to the Metropolitan and Fleurieu Peninsula regions; in general, the cover of wrack was higher, and the diversity and biomass of kelps, red algae and green algae was higher in this region compared to the other two regions. South Australian wrack deposits are thus dynamic and complex. 

The amount of wrack deposited and retained on a beach may be affected by the beach morphology but, to date, few studies have investigated this link. I assessed wrack cover on beaches with a range of morphodynamic types and found that beaches that were more dissipative in nature had a greater cover of wrack than beaches of the reflective type. I also examined whether wrack deposits affected the sediment characteristics of underlying and nearby sediments. Wrack deposits had little measurable effect on underlying sediments and did not affect particle-size distribution or organic-matter content. There was, however, a trend for beaches in the South East region of SA to have higher organic matter content in their sediments, and these beaches also have higher wrack cover and higher proportions of algae in their deposits. There was also a trend for beaches with higher wrack cover to have less compacted sediments, although this trend was not consistent. 

Overnight pit-fall trapping surveys of the macrofauna on four SA sandy beaches indicated that local macrofaunal communities were diverse (representing 72 species from 19 Orders in total), abundant, and variable in both time and space. The macrofauna encountered were mostly terrestrial taxa with only 2 truly marine species, and spanned multiple trophic levels, concurring with the results of previous studies. Macrofaunal abundances were higher where associated with wrack than in bare sand, and macrofaunal communities differed between the driftline of wrack and wrack patches away from the driftline. Within the driftline itself, there were few differences between bare sand and wrack-covered areas, suggesting that the entire driftline area is important as a habitat and food resource. Thus, wrack deposits provide an important habitat and food source for macrofauna, and the driftline provides an area of beach with concentrated resources, which in turn concentrates a distinct macrofaunal community. 

Wrack deposition on sandy beaches varies spatially and is affected by morphological features on the beach-face such as cusps. In Chapter 5, I thus tested a series of hypotheses regarding the differences in wrack deposits, sediments and macrofaunal communities between cusp bays and horns. Bays had greater cover and larger pieces of wrack than horns. Sediment organic-matter content was greater on horns than in bays but mean particle size did not differ consistently between bays and horns. Macrofaunal diversity was higher in bays and this pattern was probably driven by differences in the cover of wrack between bays and horns. Cusp morphology thus influences the distribution of wrack on the beach-face, which in turn influences the distribution of macrofauna. Studies of sandy beaches with cusps should therefore be explicitly designed to sample cusp features and their associated wrack deposits. 

Chapter 6 assesses the incorporation of wrack into beach and nearshore ecosystems via two pathways: decomposition and incorporation into trophic webs. I assessed the decomposition of algal and seagrass wrack using litterbag experiments and found that after a very rapid initial loss of mass, likely due to cell lysis and leaching, the rate of decomposition of wrack was much slower. Most release of nutrients from organic matter decay thus appears to occur in the first few days after deposition and the processes affecting the rate and nature of wrack decomposition vary among taxa (i.e. algal versus seagrass and among species). Stable isotopes of C and N were used to assess whether beach macrofauna or nearshore macro-invertebrates and fish might rely on wrack as a source of nutrition. I found that seagrasses did not provide a food source for any consumers but algae, particularly brown algae including kelps, appeared to be potential sources of nutrition for beach and nearshore consumers. The incorporation of wrack into beach and nearshore ecosystems may thus occur primarily through consumption of algal wrack by herbivores such as amphipods and dipterans, with predation on them being important pathways for the transfer of nutrients and energy into higher trophic levels. The amount of wrack in the surf zone did not affect the abundance and species richness of fish and invertebrates netted there. 

The aim of Chapter 7 was to determine the effects of wrack removal on sandy beach macrofaunal communities. In the first study the effects of large-scale commercial harvest of wrack on the macrofaunal communities at Kingston were assessed. The macrofaunal communities present in the &#145;Natural&#146; area of Kingston beach were far more diverse and abundant, and included different species, compared to the &#145;Cleared&#146; area at Kingston. In the second part of Chapter 7, I experimentally removed wrack from the driftline of beaches to assess short-term effects on macrofaunal communities. The experimental treatment did not appear to have any measurable
effects on the macrofaunal communities. I also analysed material that was removed from the beach in the raking experiments and found that a large proportion of the material (e.g. 81% of the DW) was sand. I recommend that future studies into the effects of wrack removal use large cleared areas of beach, attempt to use the same wrack removal methods and/or machinery used locally, and assess the macrofaunal communities repeatedly and over longer times following wrack removal activities. 

In Chapter 8, I attempt to assess the effects of removal of wrack for beach &#145;cleaning&#146; or commercial &#145;harvest&#146; of wrack by comparing key indicators from Chapters 2 to 7. Implications and recommendations for the management of wrack are discussed, including with regard to the techniques used in this thesis and their applicability in managing wrack deposits. I attempt to identify the shortcomings of this research as well as directions for further research. 

Thus I have demonstrated that wrack in SA provides an important link between offshore habitat and nearshore, beach and terrestrial habitats via the transfer of organic matter and nutrients. Wrack interacts with beach morphology and sediments, provides habitat for macrofauna, remineralises nutrients through its decomposition, and provides the basis of a complex trophic web. I conclude that wrack is a key component in beach ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">beach-cast wrack</field><field name="subject">beach morphology</field><field name="subject">macrofauna</field><field name="subject">macrophyte detritus</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20091125.143045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The US-China Trade: Capitalism, Consumption and Consumer Identity</field><field name="creator">Dappert, Claire P.</field><field name="description">Since the fifteenth century the rise of capitalism and the expansion of global trade networks have ensured that a wide range of consumer goods has become available to people from all walks of life. Paralleling these developments, our attitudes and beliefs about consumer goods have also changed: goods that were once considered luxuries have become commonplace in domestic households. This study celebrates the diversity of this material culture and the variety of symbolic meanings people attach to it. The US &#150; China trade, as a facet of the Spice Trade, is inextricably linked to the development of capitalism and long-distance shipping that ensured the movement of consumer goods to markets around the world. Inevitably, many of these ships sank and archaeologically their cargoes and the artifacts associated with their crew provide an opportunity to glimpse the development of our modern world. This thesis uses the shipwreck Frolic (1850) as a case study to discuss how those
involved in, and those who were supplied through, this trade used a range of consumer goods to construct distinct identities for themselves and those around them. This study also draws on a wide variety of source material, including material culture (museum collections and archaeological assemblages), images and documentary sources (courtesy literature and newspapers) to paint a broader picture of the US &#150; China trade and consumer society than any one source is capable of doing itself. This study ultimately argues that the range in consumer goods
associated with the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century US &#150; China trade is symptomatic of the increasing complexity of consumer markets able to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of a wide array of consumer identities, necessary under the many new social, economic and ideological relationships constructed under capitalism.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">historical archaeology</field><field name="subject">maritime archaeology</field><field name="subject">material culture</field><field name="subject">capitalism</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">consumer identity</field><field name="subject">Frolic</field><field name="subject">US-China Trade</field><field name="subject">Spice Trade</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20091117.131742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ignatian renewal : a case study of a long-term, multi-phase process of educational change</field><field name="creator">Sharkey, Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis drew upon the resources of philosophical hermeneutics to construct a conceptual framework for understanding the process of educational change. The experience of a particular case of change was then analysed from the perspective of the hermeneutic change agency framework.        The conceptual framework for the thesis was developed from the writings of Hans-Georg Gadamer and also from writers who engaged with Gadamer, most notably, Paul Ricoeur and Jurgen Habermas. The retrieval orientation in Gadamer's hermeneutics was balanced by the critical analyses of Ricoeur and Habermas. Gadamer's notion of the 'fusion of horizons' was presented as the culmination of the change process: a fusion between the horizon of the change text, and the horizons of the change process participants. The thesis explored the potential of hermeneutic strategies such as play and conversation as a means to animate a hermeneutic form of change agentry.         The case investigated in this thesis was a change process comprised of four strategies conducted over the years 1980 to 1996 at a Jesuit school located on the east coast of Australia. The change strategies aimed to promote the Jesuit ethos of the school and hence have been described in this thesis as 'ethos strategies'. The purpose of the thesis was not to evaluate the success of the ethos strategies, it was to explore how insights derived from philosophical hermeneutics could illuminate an analysis of the lived experience of a particular case of change. The subject matter of this thesis is timely because many Catholic schools are currently in a period of transition from a leadership exercised by Religious (nuns, brothers or priests) to a leadership exercised by lay people. The thesis situated the ethos programs in their theological and demographic contexts by presenting relevant theological developments from the Second Vatican        Council and by describing the sharp decrease in the numbers of Religious personnel available to work in the schools. The teacher response to the ethos programs was considered in the context of the many practical difficulties associated with the scheduling of teacher development programs in fast-moving and busy schools.         Although this thesis was particularly focused on change strategies that were conducted in the context of Jesuit education, the thesis is more generally situated in the research literature on educational change. The hermeneutic orientation of this thesis highlighted the elements of understanding, interpretation and meaning, and these elements are given some prominence in the more recent research literature on the change process. The complexity of change and the cultural dimension of the change process has been emphasised in the most recent educational change research literature and these themes have also found expression in this thesis.         Participant observation, document analysis and qualitative interviews were used as data collection strategies for the case study in this thesis. The researcher was actively involved in the events investigated in the case study, and a case narrative was developed from the researcher's experience as a change agent responsible for implementing one of the change strategies at the case site. The case narrative was written in the first person and from the perspective of the researcher as a change manager. The methodology of the research was grounded in the hermeneutic insight that understanding and tact lies at the heart of the research process, rather than procedure and method. Hermeneutic research relies upon a capacity to identify and respond to the question that is presented by the expression of life being understood.         Change agentry was presented in this thesis as unfolding in a middle space between the familiarity of current practice and the unfamiliarity of the new world that a change process seeks to open up. Hermeneutics has long understood that that interpretation would be impossible if the expressions of life were totally alien and unnecessary if there was nothing alien in them. A hermeneutic approach to change agentry seeks to discover points of commonality and points of challenge between the world of current practice and the world that the change process would open up. This thesis points to the tactful and dialogical dimensions of change agency when it is considered from the vantage point of philosophical hermeneutics.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational change</field><field name="subject">Ignatian education</field><field name="subject">Jesuit</field><field name="subject">Change management</field><field name="subject">Philosophical hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Gadamer</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091127.110948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Process capability assessment for univariate and multivariate non-normal correlated quality characteristics</field><field name="creator">Ahmad, Shafiq</field><field name="description">In today's competitive business and industrial environment, it is becoming more crucial than ever to assess precisely process losses due to non-compliance to customer specifications. To assess these losses, industry is extensively using Process Capability Indices for performance evaluation of their processes. Determination of the performance capability of a stable process using the standard process capability indices such as   and   requires that the underlying quality characteristics data follow a normal distribution. However it is an undisputed fact that real processes very often produce non-normal quality characteristics data and also these quality characteristics are very often correlated with each other. For such non-normal and correlated multivariate quality characteristics, application of standard capability measures using conventional methods can lead to erroneous results.   The research undertaken in this PhD thesis presents several capability assessment methods to estimate more precisely and accurately process performances based on univariate as well as multivariate quality characteristics. The proposed capability assessment methods also take into account the correlation, variance and covariance as well as non-normality issues of the quality characteristics data.    A comprehensive review of the existing univariate and multivariate PCI estimations have been provided. We have proposed fitting Burr XII distributions to continuous positively skewed data. The proportion of nonconformance (PNC) for process measurements is then obtained by using Burr XII distribution, rather than through the traditional practice of fitting different distributions to real data. Maximum likelihood method is deployed to improve the accuracy of PCI based on Burr XII distribution. Different numerical methods such as Evolutionary and Simulated Annealing algorithms are deployed to estimate parameters of the fitted Burr XII distribution.   We have also introduced new transformation method called Best Root Transformation approach to transform non-normal data to normal data and then apply the traditional PCI method to estimate the proportion of non-conforming data. Another approach which has been introduced in this thesis is to deploy Burr XII cumulative density function for PCI estimation using Cumulative Density Function technique. The proposed approach is in contrast to the approach adopted in the research literature i.e. use of best-fitting density function from known distributions to non-normal data for PCI estimation. The proposed CDF technique has also been extended to estimate process capability for bivariate non-normal quality characteristics data.   A new multivariate capability index based on the Generalized Covariance Distance (GCD) is proposed. This novel approach reduces the dimension of multivariate data by transforming correlated variables into univariate ones through a metric function. This approach evaluates process capability for correlated non-normal multivariate quality characteristics. Unlike the Geometric Distance approach, GCD approach takes into account the scaling effect of the variance-covariance matrix and produces a Covariance Distance variable that is based on the Mahanalobis distance. Another novelty introduced in this research is to approximate the distribution of these distances by a Burr XII distribution and then estimate its parameters using numerical search algorithm. It is demonstrates that the proportion of nonconformance (PNC) using proposed method is very close to the actual PNC value.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Process Capability Indices (  and  )</field><field name="subject">Non-normal multivariate data</field><field name="subject">proportion of non-conformance (PNC)</field><field name="subject">Correlated data</field><field name="subject">Burr XII distribution</field><field name="subject">Best Root Transformation approach</field><field name="subject">Cumulative Density Function technique</field><field name="subject">Simulated Annealing</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary algorithm</field><field name="subject">Geometric Distance method (GD)</field><field name="subject">Generalized Covariance Distance (GCD).</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091127.121556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Greywater treatment by Fenton, Photo-Fenton and UVC/H2O2 processes</field><field name="creator">Wee Hong, Chin</field><field name="description">Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been used to treat drinking water and wastewater but their application to greywater is limited to photocatalysis. Therefore, three homogeneous AOPs were investigated in this project: Fenton, photo-Fenton, and UVC/H2O2 processes. Alum and ferrous sulphate coagulation were also compared and their supernatants were treated by UVC/H2O2. The process comparisons were based on the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), treatment type (physical separation versus chemical oxidation), sludge formation, complexity in operation, required pH, visual aesthetic of effluent and energy requirement.    Treating greywaters collected from the researcher's home or laboratory, alum coagulation achieved 73% COD removal and was more effective than ferrous sulphate coagulation (49%) and the Fenton process (45%). The photo-Fenton process removed 83% COD, compared with 87% by overnight settlement and subsequent UVC/H2O2 treatment. Using ferrous sulphate and alum, sequential coagulation and UVC/H2O2 treatment removed 91% and 98% COD, respectively.    Overnight settlement generated little sludge and the subsequent UVC/H2O2 treatment removed most organic contaminants by oxidation. All other processes produced a large quantity of chemical sludge from coagulation which requires appropriate disposal. Also, the residual iron in some treated water was not aesthetically desirable.   The Fenton and photo-Fenton processes were complex and involved the optimisation of multiple parameters. Their requirement for different procedures according to the greywater type presents a major challenge to process design and operation.   Due to the non-selectivity of the hydroxyl radicals (&#9679;OH), the UVC/H2O2 process was capable of treating all greywaters collected by the researcher, and its operation was moderate in complexity. The COD removal was modelled as a pseudo first-order reaction in terms of H2O2 dosage: The rate constant (k&#180;) increased linearly up to 10 mM H2O2, above which the excess H2O2 scavenged the &#9679;OH and reduced the rate. The overall kinetics of COD removal followed a second-order equation of r = 0.0637 [COD][H2O2].    In contrast to the literature, operation of UVC/H2O2 in acidic conditions was not required and the enhanced COD removal at the initial pH of 10 was attributed to the dissociation of H2O2 to O2H-. Maintaining the pH at 10 or higher resulted in poorer COD removal due to the increased decomposition rate of H2O2 to O2 and H2O. The performance of the UVC/H2O2 treatment was unaffected for initial pH 3 - 10 with the initial total carbonate concentration (cT) of 3 mM. For initial cT &#8805; 10 mM, operating between pH 3 and 5 was essential.    After 3 hours of the UVC/H2O2 treatment, the effluent met the requirement of Class B reclaimed water specified by the Environment Protection Authority of Victoria, and less than 1 org/100 mL of Escherichia coli survived. A subsequent treatment such as filtration may be required to meet more requirements for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), turbidity and total suspended solids. Since the biodegradability (as BOD5:COD) of the greywater was increased from 0.22 to 0.41 with 2 hours of UVC/H2O2 treatment, its integration with a subsequent biological treatment may be viable to reduce the costs and energy consumption associated with the UVC/H2O2 process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greywater</field><field name="subject">Fenton</field><field name="subject">photo-Fenton</field><field name="subject">UVC/H2O2</field><field name="subject">AOPs</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091127.145052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Economic Analysis of the Auction Market for Australian Art: Evidence of Indigenous Difference and Creative Achievement</field><field name="creator">Coate, Bronwyn</field><field name="description">This thesis explores factors that determine the price for Australian art sold at auction. Using a large data set that comprises over 20,000 sale observations of Australian paintings sold between 1995 and 2003 characteristics associated with the artist, the work and auction are included in a series of hedonic models. In addition to modelling the overall market, differences within defined market segments for Indigenous and Non-indigenous art are explored. The role of artist identity and critical acclaim, the period in which art works are created and the event of an artist death are areas of specific focus within the analysis along with an investigation of the risks and returns associated with Australian art investment.       It is found that artist identity is a crucial factor that drives price. Further, the most highly valued Non-indigenous art works are found to be created prior to 1900, although the market for Contemporary art produced post 1980 is associated with relatively high prices also. Distinctions emerge between Indigenous and Non-indigenous art as we consider the period in which works are created and the influence this has upon price. Almost 90 per cent of Indigenous art sold at auction has been created since 1970 and it is works from the 1970s that command the highest prices for Indigenous art sold at auction. This is not unexpected given the rise of Indigenous art in the early 1970s coinciding with the emergence of the Papunya Tula art movement.           The death of an artist also proves to have a different influence upon price when we compared Indigenous and Non-indigenous art. For Non-indigenous art there is clear evidence of a death effect upon art prices, where prices typically rise around the time of an artists death before falling back somewhat with the passing of time. For Indigenous art the influence of a living artist's conditional life expectancy upon price proves to be of greater relevance in explaining price where as the artist ages and the term of their life expectancy reduces prices tend to rise.           The analysis within this thesis finishes with the construction of a number of short term art price indices where it is found that returns to investment in Indigenous art are generally higher and less risky compared to Non-indigenous art. Australian art generally and Indigenous art in particular is found to have a relatively weak correlation with the stock market suggesting that Australian art has a role to play in a balanced investment portfolio especially taking into account the aesthetic utility that can also be derived as a result of holding art.           The research contributes to understanding how the auction market for Australian art operates with emphasis paid to the distinctions and similarities observed within the sub-markets for Indigenous and Non-indigenous art. Insights from this research have the potential to inform public policy on a number of issues including the effect of resale royalties upon the operation of the auction market, and how indigenous economic development may be facilitated through a strong market for Indigenous art.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art prices</field><field name="subject">auction prices</field><field name="subject">Australian art</field><field name="subject">Indigenous art</field><field name="subject">hedonic pricing method</field><field name="subject">repeat sales method</field><field name="subject">trade to trade regression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091127.160406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping Spatial Behavioural Risk in Port Campbell National Park.</field><field name="creator">Dave, Naishadh Rushikeshbhai</field><field name="description">Humans are inherently drawn to places of naural scenic beauty. Alone in Australia's national parks; the demand on these locations is increasing because of increased population plus increasing regional domestic travel. It is important to understand how tourists are utilising nature-based tourism resources to ensure that tourist attractions, facilities and services provided in parks are not exposed to loss events. Environmental and human losses, when combined with their likelihood of occurrence, will constitute risk.    Heavy use of popular sites in particular times of the year, beyond the carrying capacity, may result in an irreparable environmental loss. Besides, human risks in terms of becoming lost in the wilderness or falling down from the cliff are significant factors that park managers are considering. It is becoming utmost important to investigate how these visitors are interacting with the natural environment, in what ways at highly vunerable sites.       Park managers are now required to understand the needs, demands, preferences and motivation of visitors to vist the parks. A proactive planning to manage potential risk particularly in relatively more fragile and vulnerable environments is needed.      This thesis documents a study of visitors to Loch Ard Gorge Site within the Port Campbell National Park, Victoria. Visitors were monitored for their spatial behaviour using the GPS receivers. Visitor's attitude, interests, opinions and motives to travel to the study location is surveyed using onsite self-administrated questionnaire. Total 102 individuals were surveyed to determine their preferences and to obtain their socio-demographical profiles.These were latter coupled with their GPS track movements in order to derive their elicited spatial behaviour.      It is well-established fact that visitors' attitude, preferences, and socio-demographical profiles are important factors to identify risk taking spatial behaviour. Hence, this research underpins the exhibited spatial behaviour of tourist to deliver their associated spatial behavioural risk typologies. Statistical classifications of visitors, based on survey responses were categorised using K-means Cluster Analysis. As a result, six different tourist types were obtained. They are;    &#149;	Mid-Allocentics possibly Risk Takers.   &#149;	Allocentrics and confirmed Risk Takers.   &#149;	Mid-Psychocentrics and Risk Averters.   &#149;	Allocentrics and Dependent Risk Takers.   &#149;	Psychocentrics and confirming Risk Averters.   &#149;	Psychocentrics and Risk Averters Mass Tourists.    The mean values of all clusters (cluster centroids) are interpreted to understand tourist's risk taking and/or risk averting preferences.       Visitors' actual spatial behavioural were spatially analysed using movement pattern maps. The typologies subsequently were verified using Discriminant Function Analysis and in this process tests of equality of group means (Significance of F-test), ANOVA classification are discussed. The final part of Discriminant Function Analysis is to determine the linear regression equations for prediction of group membership of data points in future using classification Function Matrix (Fisher's Linear Disceriminant Function).      The developed tourist typologies may help park managers to regulate and mitigate human risk prior to its occurrence by understanding the visitors personality and preferences and their risk taking probabilities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risks</field><field name="subject">nature-based tourist destinations</field><field name="subject">attitude</field><field name="subject">recreation planning and tourist spatial behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091127.163118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-scaling methods applied to population models</field><field name="creator">Grozdanovski, Tatjana</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents several applications of the multi-scaling (multi-timing) technique to the analysis of both single and two species population models where the defining parameters vary slowly with time. Although exact solutions in such cases would be preferred, they are almost always impossible to obtain when slow variation is involved. Numerical solutions can be obtained in these cases, however they are often time consuming and offer limited insight into what is causing the behaviour we see in the solution. Here an approximation method is chosen as it gives an explicit analytic approximate expression for the solutions of such population models. The multi-scaling method was chosen because the defining parameters are varying slowly compared to the response of the system. This technique is well-established in the physical and engineering sciences literature; however, it has rarely been applied in the area of population modelling.   All single species differential equation population models incorporate parameters which define the model - for example, the growth rate r and the carrying capacity k, for the Logistic model. For constant parameter values an exact solution may be found, giving the population as a function of time. However, for arbitrary time-varying parameters, exact solutions are rarely possible, and numerical solution techniques must be employed. Here we will demonstrate that for a Logistic model where the growth rate and carrying capacity both vary slowly with time, an analysis with multiple time scales leads to approximate closed form solutions that are explicit. These solutions prove to be valid for a range of parameter values and compare favourably with numerically generated ones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multi-Scaling Method</field><field name="subject">Logistic</field><field name="subject">Gompertz</field><field name="subject">Harvesting</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091130.102832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular modelling of peptide folding, misfolding and aggregation phenomena</field><field name="creator">Todorova, Nevena</field><field name="description">In this thesis we present computer modelling studies that were implemented to investigate protein behavior in various environments causing their folding, unfolding and aggregation. Applications related to two important proteins - insulin and apolipoprotein C-II (ApoC-II) are presented.    The use of atomistic simulation methodologies based on empirical force fields has enhanced our understanding of many physical processes governing protein structure and dynamics. However, the force fields used in classical modelling studies are often designed for a particular class of proteins and rely on continuous improvement and validation by comparison of simulations with experimental data. In Chapter 4 we present a comprehensive comparison of five popular force fields for simulation of insulin. The effect of each force field on the conformational evolution and structural properties of the protein is analysed in detail and compared with available experimental data.   A fundamental phenomenon in nature is the ability of proteins to fold ab initio to their functional native conformation, also known as their biologically active state. Due to the heterogeneity and dimensionality of the systems involved, it is necessary to employ methodologies capable of accelerating rare events, specifically, configurational changes that involve the crossing of large free energy barriers. In Chapter 5, using the recently developed method BE-META we were able to identify the structural transitions and possible folding pathways of insulin.   Another interesting phenomenon is the misfolding of proteins causing their aggregation, that may lead to formation of either amorphous compounds or structures of elongated-unbranched morphology known as amyloid fibrils. The deposition of amyloid fibrils in the human body may cause many debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, thus making this field of research important and urgent. The human plasma protein apoC-II serves important roles in lipid transport, and it has been shown to form amyloid-like aggregates in solution. We have performed computational studies to investigate the effect of mutations, such as Met oxidation and the residue substitutions to hydrophobic Val and hydrophilic Gln, on dynamics of apoC-II(60-70) peptide. The conformation features relevant to the amyloidogenic propensities of the peptide were identified and presented in Chapter 6.   The involvement of lipids at the various stages of development of amyloid diseases is becoming more evident in recent research efforts. In particular, micellar and sub-micellar concentrations have showed to have different effect on fibril growth and kinetics of native apoC-II and derived peptides. In Chapter 7 we investigated the influences of phospholipids at various concentrations on the structure of apoC-II(60-70) using MD and umbrella sampling methods. The molecular mechanisms of lipid effects on the peptide conformation and dynamics were identified.    In Chapter 8 preliminary results on the structural stability of pre-formed oligomeric composites of apoC-II(60-70) peptide of different sizes  and arrangements were also presented. The effects of mutation (oxidised Met, Met60Val and Met60Gln) on the most stable cluster was also investigated.   	To conclude, several ideas for continuation of research in the protein folding and aggregation field are discussed in the Future Work section of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular dynamics</field><field name="subject">protein folding</field><field name="subject">protein aggregation</field><field name="subject">amyloid fibrils</field><field name="subject">apolipoprotein C-II</field><field name="subject">insulin</field><field name="subject">mutation</field><field name="subject">lipids</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091130.111240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ANALYSIS OF CHANGING STAKEHOLDER BEHAVIOUR:
CASE STUDY OF THE CONSULTATION PROCESS FOR THE VICTORIAN ALPINE RESORTS 2020 STRATEGY</field><field name="creator">Tomsett, Paula May</field><field name="description">This study explored stakeholder behaviour during consultation processes for development, implementation, and evaluation of multi-faceted tourism strategies, using the Victorian Alpine Resorts 2020 Strategy as a case study. Stakeholders were classified using six stakeholder types (Government/Semi-government, Alpine Resort Management Board, Industry Group, Ski Club, Community-based Organisation, Individual) and five behaviour groups (allied, cooperative, neutral, competitive, threatening). An examination was made of stakeholder behaviour across the consultation process from engagement in the development of the Strategy to implementation and in attitude toward participating in an evaluation of the Strategy, behaviour recorded and factors contributing to changing behaviour analysed.
Stakeholders displayed complex behaviour patterns moving between behaviour classifications during and across the consultation process. Stakeholder behaviour and commitment to strategy implementation changed; neutral, competitive or threatening behaviour often led to less commitment to strategy success and higher levels of cynicism in the consultation process, allied or cooperative behaviour supported strategy development but did not always lead to a commitment to strategy success. Behaviour toward an evaluation of the strategy often reverted to that exhibited during development.
The majority of the stakeholders exhibited behaviour changes in both positive and negative directions and key factors in this change were associated with the consultation process itself to varying degrees of disappointment or satisfaction with the content of the final strategy document. However, negative or positive stakeholder behaviour bore no relation to stakeholder commitment to the Strategy.
The findings of this study have added the element of behaviour to stakeholder theory and analysis of stakeholders, which is currently limited to describing and identifying stakeholders. Using this understanding a model of stakeholder behaviour has been developed comprising four behaviour groups (allied, disconnected, guarded and neutral), with indicators of behaviour and suggested consultation strategies to overcome negative responses. The model may facilitate the management of stakeholder consultation processes for positive long-term outcomes, the result of which would be the ongoing support and commitment of stakeholders to strategy or policy development and implementation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stakeholders</field><field name="subject">alpine resorts</field><field name="subject">consultation</field><field name="subject">stakeholder behaviour</field><field name="subject">tourism strategy</field><field name="subject">stakeholder analysis</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090922.101514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power characterisation of a Zigbee wireless network in a real time monitoring application</field><field name="creator">Prince-Pike, Arrian</field><field name="description">Zigbee is a relatively new wireless mesh networking standard with emphasis on low cost and energy conservation.  It is intended to be used in wireless monitoring and control applications such as sensors and remotely operated switches where the end devices are battery powered.  Because it is a recent technology there is not sufficient understanding on how network architecture and configuration affect power consumption of the battery powered devices. This research investigates the power consumption and delivery ratio of Zigbee wireless mesh and star networks for a single sink real time monitoring system at varying traffic rates and the beacon and non beacon mode operation of its underlying standard IEEE 802.15.4 in the star network architecture. To evaluate the performance of Zigbee, the network operation was simulated using the simulation tool NS-2.  NS-2 is capable of simulating the entire network operation including traffic generation and energy consumption of each node in the network.  After first running the simulation it was obvious that there were problems in the configuration of the simulator as well as some unexpected behaviour.  After performing several modifications to the simulator the results improved significantly. To validate the operation of the simulator and to give insight on the operation of Zigbee, a real Zigbee wireless network was constructed and the same experiments that were conducted on the simulator were repeated on the Zigbee network.  The research showed that the modified simulator produced good results that were close to the experimental results. It was found that the non beacon mode of operation had the lowest power consumption and best delivery ratio at all tested traffic rates.  The operation of Zigbee mesh and star networks were compared to the results for IEEE 802.15.4 star networks in non beacon mode which revealed that the extra routing traffic sent by the Zigbee networking layers does contribute significantly to the power consumption, however even with the extra routing traffic, power consumption is still so low that it the battery life of the device would be limited by the shelf life of the battery, not by the energy consumption of the device. This research has successfully achieved its objectives and identified areas for future development.  The simulator model for NS-2 could be improved to further increase the accuracy of the results as well as include the Zigbee routing layers and the experimental results could be improved by a more accurate power consumption data acquisition method.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Power characterisation</field><field name="subject">Zigbee</field><field name="subject">IEEE 802.15.4</field><field name="subject">Mesh network</field><field name="subject">Simulations</field><field name="subject">NS-2</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal and Informal Controls of Government over Social Security Expenditure-An Analysis</field><field name="creator">Grose, Robert</field><field name="description">While a significant amount of research has examined the more traditional budgetary and procedural controls used by governments to maintain control over social security expenditure, very little research has examined the more obscure formal social controls used to achieve the same purpose.      The primary aim of this study was to fill this research vacuum by examining both the formal and informal mechanisms used by governments to maintain control over social security expenditure and to achieve longer-term public policy appropriation. In particular the study focused on the payment of Job Newstart and Youth Allowances and how the social control discourse of marginalisation was used to achieve such control.       The study was undertaken in two stages. In stage one, an e-mail questionnaire was distributed to Job Network consultants (n = 739) employed at 66 not-for-profit Job Network Providers throughout Australia. In stage two, focus group interviews were conducted to expand on the responses previously obtained from the e-mail questionnaire survey.       The study produced several significant findings from the views of Job Network consultants. Most significantly the results support Foucault's discourse on marginalisation. That is the results help to explain how consultants identify and single out people who do not fit the norm and therefore represent a case for special treatment. The effect of this marginalisation process is that governments are able to assert power and authority over welfare claimants and that the process is justified from the government's viewpoint. It would also seem that society and the individual accept such institutional arrangements. The techniques of marginalisation are disciplinary in their nature and relate to the multiplication of social security rules and procedures and a correlative division of the claimant population in accordance with constitutive criteria of status and entitlement. The study also concluded that Job Network consultants recognised that the breaching regime should be modified longer-term to take account of the i nformal ethical and moral criteria of fairness, justice and the rights of individuals. Having said this however, the same group of consultant's indicated in very strong terms that recipients' of Newstart and Youth Allowances should comply with their mutual obligation requirements and that they should be penalised in those instances where they do not comply with these requirements.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formal controls</field><field name="subject">informal controls</field><field name="subject">social security expenditure</field><field name="subject">marginalisation</field><field name="subject">ethics.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080627.102004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The environmental regulation of mining: an international comparison</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Noeleen</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Over the past 15 years, significant sectors of the mining industry have undertaken the Global Mining Initiative.

Further, the World Bank has highlighted the need to help the poor achieve self-sustainability as much more than just a social issue. In fact, in their view, the long-term financial growth of the Developed countries will be largely determined by the expansion of the Third World as their future client base. Those who are interested in economic development in the less developed countries strongly believe that microfinance will be an effective tool of alleviation of poverty and developing prosperity for the poor. For this reason microfinance is considered as one of the effective way of achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Central to the success of microfinance is the distribution of capital from the wealthy to the poor in a manner which encourages accountability and responsibility from therecipient, while at the same time allowing donors to see appropriate stewardship of their funds. This is measured through the achievement of financial independence ofthe group being studied. The role of implementing agencies in facilitating this efficient and accountable transfer of capital is seen to be crucial to the ongoing development of microfinance. The interrelation between donors and these agencies requires a high degree of trust and mutual accountability, in many cases built up through years of hard work and experimentation.The policy framework and legislative environment for microfinance is still evolving. For instance some countries are still developing the regulatory environment to monitor the transparency of the industry. Furthermore, there are some growing concerns on the level of efficiency of the delivery of microfinance in making an impact on projects or at least making an impact on alleviation of poverty. In order to contribute to the latter, this study investigates a major microfinance operation in thePhilippines to examine whether it is consistent with the wider international practices, particularly in achieving the MDGs.The study uses a survey tool developed by the donor agency to monitor the quantitative and qualitative aspect of the microfinance operation and benchmark them against similar operations within the Asian region. The results show that, in the majority of cases, the Philippines operation has outperformed their counterparts. However, there is considerable room for improvement to maintain the sustainability of the operation.These experiences of successes and failures need to be recorded and delineated to build on existing achievements and support an environment geared towards substantial growth in the funding of microfinance in the future. It is the intention of this study to highlight these experiences and draw attention to the very real achievements currently being experienced through some effective microfinanceprojects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microfinance;</field><field name="subject">World</field><field name="subject">Bank;</field><field name="subject">Asian</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Bank;</field><field name="subject">less</field><field name="subject">developed</field><field name="subject">countries;</field><field name="subject">third</field><field name="subject">world;</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">development;</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006289/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of marker assisted selection for the introgression of quality traits from Australian into Chinese wheats</field><field name="creator">Watson, Benedette</field><field name="description">[Abstract]Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for polyphenol oxidase and xanthophyll have a significant impact on variation in wheat flour for noodle colour and colour stability. QTLs from two Australian wheat cultivars, Sunco and Tasman, have been backcrossed into two Chinese wheat varieties, Chuanmai 22 and Mianyang 11, to assess marker predictability for these important traits in significantly different genetic backgrounds. The concept of Marker-Assisted-Selection (MAS) is being trialled in this study as a proposed method for wheat improvement. In this approach molecular markers are used in conjunction with backcross breeding methods to introgress specific characters into elite breeding materials, with the goal of improving the quality attributes of wheat for the Asian noodle market. After three single seed descent generations, the backcross populations generated allow four QTLs to be investigated. These include two for polyphenol oxidase (chromosome 2A and 2D) and two for xanthophyll (chromosome 3B and 7A). This research was successful in identifying microsatellite markers that are capable of predicting PPO activity levels and Xanthophyll content within the backcross populations. These microsatellites were validated as useful markers for these quality traits, as they have also found to be important in the Sunco x Tasman doubled haploid population. The combination of marker assisted selection and backcrossing has generated three lines that contain different combinations of the PPO activity and Xanthophyll content QTLs. These lines have been found to produce low levels of PPO activity and have a low Xanthophyll content. This improvement in flour colour and colour stability highlights the potential of marker assisted selection as a useful tool in wheat breeding.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">flour;</field><field name="subject">noodle</field><field name="subject">colour;</field><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">stability;</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">wheats;</field><field name="subject">Marker-Assisted-Selection;</field><field name="subject">Asian</field><field name="subject">noodle</field><field name="subject">market;</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006290/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing large rocklobsters, Jasus edwardsii, as a premium value-added product: Key sensory and biochemical characteristics of the flesh.</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Michael James</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT
The Southern Rocklobster, Jasus edwardsii, supports a commercial fishing industry worth $180 million AUD per annum, the majority of which is exported live to Asia. The current market demands for smaller rocklobsters can sometimes result in discounting of the larger individuals, a significant financial loss for the industry. Value adding of large rocklobster into processed product may help combat this loss; however, there is financial risk associated with the development of new products for new markets without first understanding the product variability. The aims of this thesis were to quantify raw product flesh characteristics using physical, biochemical and sensory approaches, determining the extent of variation in those characteristics, and finally to investigate the potential biological and post-harvest sources of that variation.

One of the initial requirements was the establishment of previously undefined key descriptors of sensory properties for raw rocklobster flesh, which were texture (chewiness and crunch), flavour (metallic, lobster and sweetness) and appearance (pinkness and translucency) (Chapter 2). These were tested using a combination of triangle tests and a hybrid descriptive test using a trained sensory panel. The trained panel found no significant difference in the texture, flavour or appearance of raw flesh between large and small rocklobster (Chapter 4). However, differences in the sensory descriptors of flesh translucency, pinkness and lobster flavour were significantly influenced by frozen storage of the product and the section of tail from which a sample was sourced (Chapter 4). Biochemically, these differences were largely associated with variation in flesh adenylates, with AEC, IMP load, total adenylate pool and K value being identified as the key contributors.

Of all the potential sources contributing to variation in flesh biochemical properties, post-harvest factors such as &#239;&#191;&#189;batch&#239;&#191;&#189; (i.e. rocklobsters processed on a single day) had a dominant influence (Chapter 3). The difference detected in flesh characteristics between batches was greater than any seasonal pattern such as moult stage. Biological variables such as rocklobster condition and shell colour had no significant influence on flesh properties (Chapters 3 &amp; 4). White rocklobsters are currently discounted in the live export trade; however this does not appear to be necessary for value added product owing to the lack of significant differences to red rocklobsters across a range of biochemical parameters (Chapter 3). Rocklobster physical condition (which has previously been associated with prior stress) was not shown to affect flesh biochemistry or sensory properties (Chapter 4). This result was not expected and may reflect the potential recovery of rocklobsters sampled in this study prior to processing. These findings suggest that commercial rocklobsters, which have had similar recovery, are unlikely to show reduced sensory properties.

Recent commercial interest has focussed on holding rocklobster in tanks to provide year-round supply. As a result, the impacts of tank-holding and feeding on rocklobster flesh sensory properties were investigated (Chapter 5). Rocklobsters that were tank-held and fed for up to four months produced flesh with similar physical, biochemical and sensory properties to freshly caught rocklobster. Tank-holding therefore offers a viable solution to operators wanting a year-round supply of fresh product from a resource which is subjected to a restricted fishing season.

A Japanese consumer panel was established to assess the greatest differences in flesh properties as detected by the trained sensory panel. The Japanese consumer panel assessed raw flesh from fresh, short and long-term frozen storage treatments (Chapter 4). This consumer panel detected similar differences in taste, texture and flavour as the trained panel, and whilst no significant overall preference was detected, half of the panellists showed a preference for rocklobster product that had been stored frozen for 18 months.

The findings from this research are useful for the commercial industry as they indicate that raw rocklobster flesh has little variation associated with discounting factors such as size and shell colour. Although the greatest variation in flesh biochemistry was seen with frozen storage, even long term storage produced rocklobster flesh properties which were favourable for some panellists. The commercially caught Southern Rocklobster appears to have raw flesh properties well suited for a value added product.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rocklobster</field><field name="subject">sensory</field><field name="subject">flesh</field><field name="subject">meat</field><field name="subject">adenylate</field><field name="subject">feeding</field><field name="subject">seasonal</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20091203.190625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How and Why GPs commit the time to precept medical students</field><field name="creator">Walters, Lucie</field><field name="description">This thesis defines the time impact of precepting medical students on rural general practitioners and explains how and why they commit the time to precept. To answer this question, original research was undertaken within the context of the innovative community-based medical education program, the Parallel Rural Community Curriculum (PRCC), using the parallel consulting model. Chapters One to Three detail the context of this study, appraise the existing evidence in the literature, and establish the rigour of the study design. In line with the constructivist theoretical perspective presented by the author, a case study methodology was chosen for this study. The thesis is constructed in two parts.

Results from a prospective cohort study of GPs&#239;&#191;&#189; videotaped consulting, with and without students, are described in Chapters Four and Five. No increase in consultation time or non-consulting time was found when precepting medical students. GPs&#239;&#191;&#189; activities changed, suggesting they adapted their behaviour when students were present.

An interpretive study, using a grounded theory approach, was used to explain the &#239;&#191;&#189;how&#239;&#191;&#189; and &#239;&#191;&#189;why&#239;&#191;&#189; of the research question. Interview data from GP preceptors, practice managers and students was used to construct a transferable explanatory theory as it emerged from the data.  These results are presented in Chapters Six and Seven. 

The majority of GPs considered precepting more time consuming than consulting alone. This finding was not consistent with the videotaped data. GPs consistently experienced time pressure in their roles due to constant intrusion of competing priorities. This increased when precepting students. Frequent descision making by GPs as a response to their drive to remain on time was found to be a significant contributing factor to the changes found in consultation activities.

Although many types of professional enrichment were identified by GP preceptors as adding value to precepting, the doctor-student relationship was clearly defined as the most important motivator for precepting in this study.

The case study analysis explains how and why this occurred, and documents the maturation of the doctor-student repationship over time in the year long PRCC attachments. Through a grounded theory analysis of the data, four precepting consultation models emerged: student observer, teacher-healer, doctor orchestrator and doctor advisor. In Chapter Eight, the study defines these models in the context of legitimate peripheral participation of a novice member of the rural GP community of practice. The corroborative evidence from the literature suggests that these models may be applicable to other settings, particularly other community-based medical education sites.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">precepting</field><field name="subject">medical students</field><field name="subject">general practice</field><field name="subject">parallel consulting</field><field name="subject">primary care</field><field name="subject">work-based learning</field><field name="subject">clinical placements</field><field name="subject">longitudinal integrated clerkships</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20091204.122749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Let's talk (discreetly) about sex.   The content generation and design of an online sexual and reproductive health information resource for young Vietnamese: a communications perspective.</field><field name="creator">Clements, Alice Faith</field><field name="description">Vietnam is a populous nation experiencing rapid social and economic transition. These changes, in combination with the spread of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS, are compromising the reproductive health of young Vietnamese.       Access to reliable reproductive health information is limited and social taboos prevent young people from talking openly about this topic. A huge number of young people living in Vietnam thus find themselves without access to relevant, accurate, non-threatening and unbiased information about sexuality and sexual health.       The research outlined in this thesis approaches the issue of sexual health information provision for young people living in Vietnam from a participatory action research foundation. A key focus is investigation of the ways in which young people living in Vietnam can be included in the development of online sexual health communication tools by, for and about young Vietnamese.       As part of this investigation, this thesis describes research conducted with young Vietnamese in Australia and Vietnam to identify and elucidate their reproductive health information needs, as situated within the contemporary Vietnamese socio-cultural context. The research was undertaken in order to determine how an online resource might meet these needs. This exploratory process involved the utilisation of a range of research methods to determine the website's optimal content, style, features and tone in relation to the Vietnamese context and requirements of its target users.      It is hoped that the record of discovery resulting from this research journey will contribute to the existing body of knowledge on online health communication and participatory approaches to the development of context-sensitive health and behaviour-change communication.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">communications</field><field name="subject">sexual health</field><field name="subject">reproductive health</field><field name="subject">sex education</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">health communication.

This is mainly due to their high strength and light weight characteristics. But with all the advantages they have, they are prone to delamination or matrix cracking. These types of damage are often invisible and if undetected, could lead to appalling failures of structures. Although there are systems to detect such damage, the criticality assessment and prognosis of the damage is often more difficult to achieve. The research study conducted here primarily deals with the structural health monitoring of composite materials by analysing vibration signatures acquired from a laser vibrometer. The primary aim of the project is to develop a vibration based structural health monitoring (SHM) method for detecting flaws such as delamination within the composite beams. Secondly, the project emphasises on the method's ability to recognise the locatio n and severity of the damage within the structure. The system proposed relies on the examination of the displacement mode shapes acquired from the composite beams using the laser vibrometer and later processing them to curvature mode shapes for damage identification and characterization. Other identification techniques such as a C-scan has been applied to validate the location and size of the defects with the structures tested. The output from these plots enabled the successful identification of both the location and extent of damage within the structure with an accuracy of 96.5%. In addition to this, this project also introduces a method to experimentally compute the critical stress intensity factor, KIC for the composite beam. Based on this, a technique for extending the defect has been proposed and validated using concepts of fatigue and fracture mechanics. A composite specimen with a 40 mm wide delamination embedded within was loaded under fatigue conditions and extension of the defect by 4mm on either s ide of the specimen's loading axis was achieved satisfactorily. The experimental procedure to extend the defect using fatigue was validated using the SLV system. Displacement and Curvature mode shapes were acquired post-fatigue crack extension. Upon analysing and comparing the displacement and curvature mode shapes before and after crack extension, the extended delamination was identified satisfactorily.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural Health Monitoring</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Damage</field><field name="subject">Curvature Mode Shapes</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Response</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091002.143408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours on buyers&#8217; commitment</field><field name="creator">Herjanto, Halimin</field><field name="description">Healthy buyer-seller relationships are seen as a source of buyers&#8217; satisfaction, commitment and loyalty. However, creating fruitful relationships with buyers is not always simple and straightforward for salespersons, especially when they seek to establish relationships with buyers from different cultures. Given the challenging nature of intercultural interaction, it becomes imperative for salespersons to identify the behaviours that will best suit such relationships. There is much evidence that salespersons frequently adopt acculturation behaviours in order to build relationships with buyers from different cultures, however the study of acculturation behaviours, though not unknown to marketing scholars, has not been well explored in relationship marketing domains. Studies on the impact of acculturation behaviours from the viewpoint of salespersons are particularly non-existent.  The present study examines the limited available literature on this subject, and attempts to develop a better understanding of the concept of salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours by proposing a model that explains the relationship between salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours and buyers&#8217; satisfaction as well as commitment in the banking context.  The hypotheses are empirically tested in the present study by using appropriate statistical techniques. Results of the study indicate that the hypothesised model of salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours fits the data well. The hypotheses focus on four dimensions of salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours: assimilation, separation, integration and marginalisation. All of these dimensions, excluding separation, show an inter-relationship among the variables of the model and are confirmed with the right significance. Separation is not examined closely within the study as by its nature it is itself exclusionary of any form of interaction with buyers.  Findings from the study indicate however that integration and assimilation positively affect buyers&#8217; satisfaction, whereas marginalisation is negatively associated with buyers&#8217; satisfaction. The results also reveal that buyers&#8217; satisfaction has a mediation effect on the relationships between assimilation, integration, marginalisation and buyers&#8217; commitment.  The model also includes the constructs of interaction intensity, which is positively related to buyers&#8217; satisfaction and buyers&#8217; commitment. This study can be considered as an important step in establishing the linkage between salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours and buyers&#8217; satisfaction and commitment. It establishes that salespersons&#8217; acculturation is needed to perform better and create sustainable intercultural interaction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acculturation</field><field name="subject">Banking</field><field name="subject">Salesperson</field><field name="subject">Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Buyers</field><field name="subject">Commitment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio segmentation, classification and visualization</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xin</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new approach to the visualization of audio files that simultaneously illustrates general audio properties and the component sounds that comprise a given input file. New audio segmentation and classification methods are reported that outperform existing methods. In order to visualize audio files, the audio is segmented (separated into component sounds) and then classified in order to select matching archetypal images or video that represent each audio segment and are used as templates for the visualization. Each segment's template image or video is then subjected to image processing filters that are driven by audio features. One visualization method reported represents heterogeneous audio files as a seamless image mosaic along a time axis where each component image in the mosaic maps directly to a discovered component sound. The second visualization method, video texture mosaics, builds on the ideas developed in time mosaics. A novel adaptive video texture generation method was created by using acoustic similarity detection to produce a resultant video texture that more accurately represents an audio file. Compared with existing visualization methods such as oscilloscopes and spectrograms, both approaches yield more accessible illustrations of audio files and are more suitable for casual and non expert users.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audio</field><field name="subject">Segmentation</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Visualization</field><field name="subject">Time mosaics</field><field name="subject">Video textures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward real-time control of surface irrigation</field><field name="creator">Khatri, K. L.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The performance of surface irrigation is a function of the field design, infiltration characteristic of the soil, and the irrigation management practice. However, the complexity of the interactions makes it difficult for irrigators to identify optimaldesign or management practices. The infiltration characteristic of the soil is the most crucial of all the factors affecting the performance of surface irrigation and both spatial and temporal variations in the infiltration characteristic are a major physicalconstraint to achieving higher irrigation application efficiencies. Real-time optimisation and control has the potential to overcome these spatial and temporalvariations and return highly significant improvements in performance. Calculation of the infiltration parameters from irrigation advance data is now the preferred method.If the process is to be included in a real time control system it must be done accurately, reliably and rapidly, and with a minimum of field data. Substantial workhas been directed towards developing methods to estimate the infiltration characteristics of soil from irrigation advance data. However, none of the existing methods are entirely suitable for use in real time control. The greatest limitation is that they are data intensive and or unreliable and provide soil infiltration propertiesafter an irrigation event.A simple real-time control system for furrow irrigation is proposed that: predicts the infiltration characteristics of the soil in real-time using data measured during anirrigation event, simulates the irrigation, and determines the optimum time to cut-off for that irrigation. The basis of the system is a new method for the Real-timeEstimation of the Infiltration Parameters (REIP) under furrow irrigation, developed during this research study, and that uses a model infiltration curve, and a scalingprocess to predict the infiltration characteristics for each furrow and each irrigation event. The underlying hypothesis for the method is that the shape of the infiltration characteristic for a particular field or soil is relatively constant (across the field andwith time), despite variations in the magnitude of the infiltration rate or amount. A typical furrow in the field is selected for evaluation (known as the model furrow)and its infiltration parameters (a, k, fo) in the Kostiakov&#8211;Lewis equation are determined by a model such as INFILT or IPARM using inflow, advance and runoffdata. Subsequently the infiltration parameters for this model furrow can be scaled to give the cumulative infiltration curves for the whole field. In this process a scaling factor (F) is formulated from rearrangement of the volume balance equation and is calculated for each furrow/event using the model infiltration parameters and the single advance point. The performance of each furrow can then be simulated and optimised using an appropriate simulation model to determine the preferred time tocut-off.Using this new method, infiltration parameters were calculated for two different fields T &amp; C. The SIRMOD simulation model was then used to simulate irrigationperformance (application efficiency, requirement efficiency and uniformity) under different model strategies. These strategies were framed to assess the feasibility of and demonstrate the gains from the real-time control strategy. The infiltration evaluation results revealed that the infiltration curves produced by the proposed method were of similar shape and hence gave a distribution of cumulative depths of infiltration for the whole field that was statistically equivalent to that given using the complete set of advance data for each furrow. The advance trajectories produced bythe proposed method also matched favourably to the measured advances.The simulation results showed firstly that the scaled infiltration gave predictions of the irrigation performance similar to the actual performance. They also indicated that by adopting the simple real time control system, irrigation application efficiencies forthe two fields could be improved from 76% for field T and 39% for field C (under usual farm management) to 83% and 70% for the fields T &amp; C, respectively. Savingsof 1239 m3 in the total volume of water applied per irrigation over the area of 7.1 ha of both fields were indicated, which can be used beneficially to grow more crop. The proposed real-time control system is shown to be feasible. It requires few data for itsoperation and provides the infiltration characteristics for each furrow without significant loss of accuracy. The irrigation performance is improved greatly from thatachieved under current farmer management and a substantial reduction in the volume of water applied per irrigation is achievable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface</field><field name="subject">irrigation;</field><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">systems;</field><field name="subject">real-time</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004109/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Macedonia 1991-2001: a case-study of conflict prevention - lessons learned and broader theoretical implications</field><field name="creator">Ripiloski, Sasho</field><field name="description">Notwithstanding a broad range of internal and external stresses, Macedonia was the only republic to attain its independence peacefully from the otherwise violent disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.  Subject of a timely and sustained international response, it was feted as a rare preventive success for the international community.  Whilst not necessarily decisive, this mobilisation helped ensure a non-violent transition to independence.  Yet, much to the surprise of outside observers, Macedonia would fall into conflict a decade after independence, when self-styled freedom fighters purporting to represent the local Albanian community launched an eight-month insurgency in the name of political and cultural equality.  Triggered by a coalescence of political, nationalist, ideological and criminal interests, the insurgency had complex roots, as much an intra-Albanian putsch as a struggle for greater group rights.        Regardless of their precise genesis, from the perspective of conflict prevention, the events of 2001 challenge popular assumptions of Macedonia as an international success story.  Above all, they reinforce the need for external actors to incorporate short-term strategies of prevention targeting immediate sources of instability within a more comprehensive, long-term framework that addresses structural, underlying conflict causes.  Indeed, whilst proximate threats to Macedonian stability were addressed, fundamental risk factors remained, namely social polarisation, a large ethnic minority disenfranchised with the state, economic under-development, high levels of organised crime and corruption, a weak rule-of-law and continuing regional uncertainty.  These were partly aggravated by the mistakes of a complacent international community, whose engagement in the country, accordingly, receded over time.  In particular, the dissertation is critical of the European Union for its initial failure to articulate a genuine  pathway to membership for Macedonia and the broader western Balkans, as well as the handling of NATO's military intervention in neighbouring Kosovo.  Of course, in any preventive endeavour, the international community can only do so much; in the first instance, responsibility lay with unresponsive Macedonian institutions, who failed to adequately address legitime Albanian demands dating from independence.  Be that as it may, the international community was culpable for its failure to sufficiently apply the formidable soft-power leverage it wields over a weak Macedonian state to implement reforms that, conceivably, could have precluded the outbreak of armed conflict.     As a case-study of prevention, Macedonia holds instructive lessons for scholars and policymakers.  Yet it remains under-researched.  Examining the period 1991-2001, this investigation analyses precisely why and how Macedonia avoided violence during the process of Yugoslav dissolution yet ultimately fell into conflict, and extrapolates broader lessons that may be applied to other at-risk societies.  Its purpose is to advance understanding of a poorly understood country, and contribute knowledge to key on-going international security debates.  Highlighting the inter-connectedness and trans-national character of contemporary security threats, it posits that the major powers have a practical interest in addressing emerging intra-state crises, even when the putative national interest appears marginal.  To facilitate more timely multilateral responses, it calls for the de-nationalisation of security, and its conceptualisation in international - as opposed to strictly national - terms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Republic of Macedonia</field><field name="subject">former Yugoslavia</field><field name="subject">conflict prevention</field><field name="subject">intra-societal conflict</field><field name="subject">insurgency</field><field name="subject">conflict management</field><field name="subject">conditions of intra-state peace</field><field name="subject">de-nationalisation of security.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090507.141532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fissure : an extract of a novel</field><field name="creator">Hall, Grant</field><field name="description">The creative outcome of my Masters Degree is an extract of my manuscript for a novel.

Applications such as fruit and vegetable grading were amongst the earliest applications, but the field has diversified into areas such as yield monitoring, weed identification and spraying, and tractor guidance. 	 Machine vision systems generally consist of a number of steps that are similar between applications. These steps include image pre-processing, analysis, and post-	 processing. This leads the way towards a generalisation of the systems to an almost &#8216;colour by number&#8217; methodology where the platform may be consistent between many applications, and only algorithms specific to the application differ. 	 Shape analysis is an important part of many machine vision applications. Many methods exist for determining existence of particular objects, such as Hough Transforms and statistical matching. A method of describing the outline of objects, called s-&#968; (s-psi) offers advantages over other methods in that it reduces a two dimensional object to a series of one dimensional numbers. This graph, or chain, of numbers may be directly manipulated to perform such tasks as determining the convex hull, or template matching. 	 A machine vision system to automate yield monitoring macadamia harvesting is proposed as a partial solution to the labour shortage problems facing researchers 	 undertaking macadamia varietal trials in Australia. 	 A novel method for objectively measuring citrus texture is to measure the shape of a light terminator as the fruit is spun in front of a video camera. A system to accomplish this task is described.

Veterans diagnosed with PTSD scored higher on the Young Schema Questionnaire and had higher scores on the Measure of Parental Style (MOPS) than veterans not diagnosed with PTSD. Only three childhood negative events were associated with PTSD: witnessing domestic violence; mother unemployed; and living with a stepfather. These variables may relate to research on negative family environment being associated with PTSD, whereas schemas may relate to parenting. The finding of strong relationships between negative life events data and adverse parenting endorses the MOPS as a valid instrument.

Admission to hospital in Vietnam was the only war variable related to PTSD. Schemas mediated the negative parenting - PTSD link, and the Vietnam War experience - PTSD link. The results suggest that early maladaptive schemas have an important role in the development or maintenance of PTSD in Vietnam veterans.

The second study measured at baseline, termination and three months the early maladaptive schemas, PTSD, anxiety, depression, and relationships of war-veterans (n = 54) participating in a PTSD group treatment program that included schema-focused therapy. Scores on the PTSD Check List, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and 17 schemas decreased significantly after treatment. The Abbreviated Dyadic Adjustment Scale and the Assessment of Quality of Life scores indicated that the veterans&#146; current relationships improved. Partners of veterans also experienced enhanced relationships. All gains were maintained at three-month follow-up. The five schema domains were associated with an improvement in PTSD symptoms, with gains on the impaired autonomy domain being associated with 26.3% of the changes in PTSD. Change scores for the schema treatment were compared to a similar earlier manualised CBT program. Pre-treatment measures were similar in both groups. Nevertheless, PTSD and anxiety improved significantly more for the schema-focused therapy group. Although the second study was not a randomised control comparison, both studies support the feasibility of schema-focused therapy to assist veterans with PTSD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Veterans</field><field name="subject">early maladaptive schemas</field><field name="subject">PTSD</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090924.134704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silicon Nanowires for Photvoltaic Applications</field><field name="creator">D.Parlevliet@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Silicon nanowires are a nanostructure consisting of elongated crystals of silicon. Like many nanostructures, silicon nanowires have properties that change with size. In particular, silicon nanowires have a band-gap that is tuneable with the diameter of the nanowire. They tend to absorb a large portion of the light incident upon them and they form a highly textured surface when grown on an otherwise flat substrate. These properties indicate silicon nanowires are good candidates for use in solar cells. 

Nanostructured silicon, in the form of nanocrystalline silicon, has been used to produce thin film solar cells. Solar cells produced using silicon nanowires could combine the properties of the silicon nanowires with the low material costs and good stability of nanocrystalline based solar cells.

This thesis describes the process of optimisation of silicon nanowire growth on a plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition system. This optimised growth of silicon nanowires is then used to demonstrate a prototype solar cell using silicon nanowires and amorphous silicon. Several steps had to be accomplished to reach this goal. 

The growth of silicon nanowires was optimised through a number of steps to produce a high density film covering a substrate. Developments were made to the standard deposition technique and it was found that by using pulsed plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition the density of nanowire growth could be improved. Of a range of catalysts trialled, gold and tin were found to be the most effective catalysts for the growth of silicon nanowires. A range of substrates was investigated and the nanowires were found to grow with high density on transparent conductive oxide coated glass substrates, which would allow light to reach the nanowires when they were used as part of a solar cell. The silicon nanowires were combined with doped and intrinsic amorphous silicon layers with the aim to create thin film photovoltaic devices. Several device designs using silicon nanowires were investigated. The variant that showed the highest efficiency used doped silicon nanowires as a p-layer which was coated with intrinsic and n-type amorphous silicon. 

By the characterisation and optimisation of the silicon nanowires, a prototype silicon nanowire solar cell was produced. The analysis of these prototype thin film devices, and the nanowires themselves, indicated that silicon nanowires are a promising material for photovoltaic applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silicon nanowires</field><field name="subject">solar cell</field><field name="subject">photovoltaic</field><field name="subject">nanomaterial</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">deposition techniques</field><field name="subject">catalysts</field><field name="subject">PECVD</field><field name="subject">PPECVD</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090930.140302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a reverse genetic system for Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) and the molecular basis of its growth phenotype and adaptation to mice</field><field name="creator">pphuek@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) is a member of the Human Enterovirus A species within the Family Picornaviridae.  Since 1997, HEV71 has emerged as a major cause of epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) associated with severe neurological disease in the Asia-Pacific region.  At the present time, little is known about the pathogenesis of acute neurological disease caused by HEV71.  The major aim of this study was to generate infectious cDNA clones of HEV71 and use them as tools for investigating the biology of HEV71 and molecular genetics of HEV71 virulence and pathogenesis. 

Two infectious cDNA clones of HEV71 clinical isolates, 26M (genotype B3) and 6F (genotype C2) were successfully constructed using a low copy number plasmid vector and an appropriate bacterial host.  Transfection of cDNA clones or RNA transcripts derived from these clones produced infectious viruses.  Phenotypic characterisation of clone-derived viruses (CDV-26M and CDV-6F) was performed, and CDV-26M and CDV-6F were found to have indistinguishable phenotypes compared to their wild type viruses. 

Strains HEV71-26M and HEV71-6F were found to have distinct cell culture growth phenotypes.  To identify the genome regions responsible for the growth phenotypes of the two strains a series of chimeric viruses were constructed by exchanging the 5&#132;S untranslated region (5&#132;S UTR), structural protein (P1), and nonstructural protein (P2 and P3) gene regions using infectious cDNA clones of both virus strains.  Analysis of reciprocal virus chimeras revealed that the 5&#132;S UTR of both strains were compatible but not responsible for the observed phenotypes.  Both the P1 and P2-P3 genome regions influence the HEV71 growth phenotype in cell culture, phenotype expression is dependent on specific P1/P2-P3 combinations and is not reciprocal.

In the previous study, in order to investigate the pathogenesis of HEV71 infection, a mouse HEV71 model was developed using a mouse-adapted variant of HEV71-26M.  Mouse-adapted strain MP-26M caused fore- and/or hindlimb paralysis in mice, whereas HEV71-26M-infected mice did not develop clinical signs of infection at any virus dose or route of inoculation tested.  In this study, the molecular basis of mouse adaptation by HEV71 was identified.  Nucleotide sequence analysis of HEV71-26M and MP-26M revealed three point mutations in the open reading frame, each resulting in an amino acid substitution in the VP1, VP2 and 2C proteins; no mutations were identified in the untranslated regions of the genome.  To determine which of the three amino acid mutations were responsible for the adaptation and virulence of HEV71-26M in mice, recombinant cDNA clones containing one, or a combination of two or three mutations, were constructed.  Mouse virulence assays of the mutated viruses clearly demonstrated that a non-conservative amino acid substitution (G710&#132;_E) in the capsid protein VP1 alone was sufficient to confer the mouse virulence phenotype on HEV71.

In addition, a mouse oral infection model was established in this study.  Oral inoculation with the mouse-adapted HEV71 virus, MP-26M, induced fore-or hindlimb paralysis in newborn mice in an age- and dose-dependent manner.  As oral transmission is the natural route of HEV71 infection, this murine HEV71 oral infection model will provide a suitable tool for studying HEV71 pathogenesis, for defining neurological determinants, and for testing vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity in the future.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human enterovirus 71</field><field name="subject">reverse genetic</field><field name="subject">molecular basis</field><field name="subject">growth phenotype</field><field name="subject">mouse adaptation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090930.164614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of program theory-based evaluation on the use of evaluation information: A longitudinal study</field><field name="creator">bigskies@iprimus.com.au</field><field name="description">Theory-based evaluation studies have long been promoted as increasing stakeholder knowledge of the program and improving decision-making (Bickman, 1987; Chen, 2004; Suchman, 1967; Weiss, 1998), but such advocacy has little empirical research support. This paper helps to redress this deficiency by reporting on an empirical study which investigated the relationship between the use of program theory as the basis for an evaluation study and the nature of the evaluation information generated and its utility. 

The investigation followed three program evaluation studies through their term and focused on the extent of theory use and the nature and influence of the information from each evaluation. A model of factors which it has been suggested influence the use of program evaluation information was developed and investigated (Alkin, 1985; Cousins &amp; Leithwood, 1986, 1993; Cummings, 1997; Leviton &amp; Hughes, 1981; Hudson-Mabbs, 1993; Pawson &amp; Tilley, 1997; Preskill &amp; Torres, 1997). Structural equation modeling was used to test and further explore the model, while qualitative data were used to gain further insight into the study findings.

The investigation was not able to confirm that a greater use of program theory in an evaluation study improves the usefulness of evaluation findings. The study does, however, identify interactions between program theory and other predictor variables, such as the characteristics of the evaluation study, related to increased information use. It also provides further evidence regarding the importance of stakeholder involvement in an evaluation study on the extent to which they use and are influenced by evaluation information. Furthermore, this research provides insight into perceptions developed by many evaluators through experience and practice, such as the vulnerability of an evaluation study to contextual factors which typically are outside the control of the evaluation team.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theory-Based</field><field name="subject">Program Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Use</field><field name="subject">Information</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091002.91837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative genomics to investigate genome function and adaptations in the newly sequenced Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli</field><field name="creator">pwanch@msu.ac.th</field><field name="description">Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli are anaerobic intestinal spirochaetes that are the aetiological agents of swine dysentery and intestinal spirochaetosis, respectively. As part of this PhD study the genome sequence of B. hyodysenteriae strain WA1 and a near complete sequence of B. pilosicoli strain 95/1000 were obtained, and subjected to comparative genomic analysis. The B. hyodysenteriae genome consisted of a circular 3.0 Mb chromosome, and a 35,940 bp circular plasmid that has not previously been described. The incomplete genome of B. pilosicoli contained 4 scaffolds. There were 2,652 and 2,297 predicted ORFs in the B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli strains, respectively. Of the predicted ORFs, more had similarities to proteins of the enteric Clostridium species than they did to proteins of other spirochaetes. Many of these genes were associated with transport and metabolism, and they may have been gradually acquired through horizontal gene transfer in the environment of the large intestine. 

A reconstruction of central metabolic pathways of the Brachyspira species identified a complete set of coding sequences for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, a non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide metabolism and a respiratory electron transport chain. A notable finding was the presence of rfb genes on the B. hyodysenteriae plasmid, and their apparent absence from B. pilosicoli. As these genes are involved in rhamnose biosynthesis it is likely that the composition of the B. hyodysenteriae lipooligosaccharide O-sugars is different from that of B. pilosicoli. O-antigen differences in these related species could be associated with differences in their specific niches, and/or with their disease specificity. Overall, comparison of B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli protein content and analysis of their central metabolic pathways showed that they have diverged markedly from other spirochaetes in the process of adapting to their habitat in the large intestine. 

The presence of overlapping genes in the two spirochaetes and in other spirochaete species also was investigated. The number of overlapping genes in the 12 spirochaete genomes examined ranged from 11-45%. Of these, 80% were unidirectional. Overlapping genes were found irregularly distributed within the Brachyspira genomes such that 70-80% of them occurred on the same strand (unidirectional, -&gt;-&gt;/&lt;-&lt;-), with 16-28% occurring on opposite DNA strands (divergent, &lt;--&gt;).  The remaining 4-6% of overlapping genes were convergent (-&gt;&lt;-). The majority of the unidirectional overlap regions were relatively short, with &gt;50% of the total observations overlapping by &gt;4 bp. A small number of overlapping gene-pairs were duplicated within each genome and there were some triplet overlapping genes. Unique orthologous overlapping genes were identified within the various spirochaete genera. Over 75% of the overlapping genes in the Brachyspira species were in the same or related metabolic pathway. This finding suggests that overlapping genes are not only likely to be the result of functional constraints but also are constrained from a metabolomic context. Of the remaining 25% overlapping genes, 50% contained one hypothetical gene with unknown function. In addition, in one of the orthologous overlapping genes in the Brachyspira species, a promoter was shared, indicating the presence of a novel class of overlapping gene operon in these intestinal spirochaetes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brachyspira hyodysenteriae</field><field name="subject">Brachyspira pilosicoli</field><field name="subject">comparative genomic</field><field name="subject">complete genome sequence</field><field name="subject">genome annotation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091023.115612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'Vampires in the Sacristy': Feminist body theory and (socio)biological reductionism into the 21st century</field><field name="creator">lroarty@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">What happens when feminist body theory and reductionist theories of biological sex difference are brought together? In this work I take as my starting point the increasing ubiquity of appeals to biology as an explanation for &#145;human&#146; and &#145;woman&#146;s&#146; nature on the one hand, and the reactive and reflexive distancing of biology within feminist body theory on the other, to begin to question the middle ground. I aim to constructively dissent from taking up either of these positions in order to confront the question: what if the reductionists prove to be, even partially, right? In acknowledging that possibility, I am interested in whether/where there is potential for feminist theory to be more relaxed about biologically sex differentiated attributes.

I position myself as a women&#146;s studies scholar taking a walk across the campus to see what evidence is being produced by &#145;the opposition&#146;. To place my walk in context, I first briefly explore various feminist approaches to the problem of biological sex differences, and the continuing difficulties surrounding binaries and binary thinking. Next, in the main part of the thesis, I review the historical and contemporary reasoning and claims made within three areas of reductionist science that are aligning at this time, and which have been reproached for promoting a return to a more biologically determinist social environment. I then take a brief excursion off campus to demonstrate the dangerous aspects of these scientific enterprises when their interpretation into popular culture is not carefully monitored. Finally, I return again to my own side of the campus to look at some of the ways feminists have already begun the work of overturning outworn and contested conventional theories about biology and human nature in conversation with reductionist theory.  

Having done this, was it worth the walk? My assessment is that while, in some cases, feminism&#146;s defensive antiessentialism is warranted, there is work being undertaken within these reductionist sciences that is less rigid and reactionary than some critical interpretation would suggest. I conclude that there is a certain futility in feminist body theory&#146;s oppositional stance to biology, and that its utility is put at risk by a continued investment in one side of a binary. Further, my walk across the campus leads me to believe that, while perhaps not imminent, there is every reason to expect that the scientific pursuit of an unequivocal genetic basis for specific sex differentiated behaviours will succeed. That being so, there are spaces where the insights of both sides might be productively brought together so as to avoid the worst excesses of biological determinism  and, at the same time, loosen the grip of binary thinking on approaches to biology and the body.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sociobiology</field><field name="subject">behavioural genetics</field><field name="subject">evolutionary psychology</field><field name="subject">biophobia</field><field name="subject">dualism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091027.70346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Potential of Triclabendazole in Combination with Praziquantel for the Treatment of Schistosoma mansoni Infections</field><field name="creator">sbong@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Previous work has suggested that triclabendazole, a member of the benzimidazole group of compounds, possessed efficacy against Schistosoma mansoni. In view of recent indications in praziquantel treatment failures and loss of sensitivity, it is imperative that new anti-schistosomals are developed as contingent treatment options, while resistance alleles, if any, remain at low frequencies. While recent studies have indicated that triclabendazole monotherapy exert weak anti-schistosomal effects, the combinatorial application of triclabendazole with praziquantel has not been explored. To assess this hypothesis, triclabendazole and its metabolites were initially assessed against the many life-stages of Schistosoma mansoni in vitro. Combinatorial drug and isobologram analyses against adult Schistosoma mansoni was also performed, and subsequently applied against other parasitic models (Giardia duodenalis and Haemonchus contortus) to assess the specificity of such effects. Subsequently, the drug combinations were assessed against Schistosoma mansoni in vivo. To further assess the suitability of combinatorial drug applications, an economic model was developed to project the cost-efficacy of praziquantel-triclabendazole drug combinations in a global focus. It was concluded that triclabendazole and its metabolites possessed good efficacy against immature schistosomula, albeit weak efficacy against adult Schistosoma mansoni. Upon combination with praziquantel, however, a strong synergistic effect against adult worms were observed in vitro. Praziquantel and triclabendazole were also shown to possess unique and independent ovicidal modes of action that can be of clinical significance. More importantly, in vivo drug trials concluded that the combinations exerted additive effects against Schistosoma mansoni harbored in mice. Economic modeling and cost-effectiveness analyses further demonstrated the feasibility of this drug combination, and may represent a new line of treatment against mansonial schistosomiasis</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schistosoma mansoni</field><field name="subject">Praziquantel</field><field name="subject">Triclabendazole</field><field name="subject">Drug Combination</field><field name="subject">Egg Hatching</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091029.105434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protecting Civilians or Preserving Interests? Explaining the UN Security Council's Non-intervention in Darfur, Sudan, 2003-06.</field><field name="creator">D.Mickler@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The UN Security Council is the preeminent multilateral decision-making body and has the legal authority to initiate military interventions if it first determines a threat to international peace and security, including from civil wars or widespread state repression. While traditional norms of non-intervention and the politics of the Cold War curtailed the body&#146;s ability to fulfil this role, evolving understandings and practices of sovereignty and security in the post-Cold War era have led to the apparent emergence of a new norm permitting &#145;humanitarian intervention&#146; and an in principle acceptance that the body has a &#145;responsibility to protect&#146; vulnerable civilians residing inside the borders of their own state, including through military means.

In this context, the thesis argues that the situation in Darfur, western Sudan, has represented a quintessential case for the Council to fulfil its &#145;responsibility to protect&#146;. According to a number of authoritative investigations, since 2003 the Sudanese government and government-allied Arab militias have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity on a widespread and systematic basis against Darfur&#146;s non-Arab population. As a result, over 200,000 people died either directly from violence or indirectly from conflict-induced disease and malnutrition, while a further two million fled from their homes and villages in fear. A number of nonmilitary measures were attempted by the Council but failed to create adequate security on the ground.

As such, there was a compelling legal-institutional, normative and moral case for the Council to coercively deploy a military intervention in Sudan to protect vulnerable civilians in Darfur. However, during the 2003-06 period of study, no such intervention was deployed. The thesis argues that intervention by the Council was precluded by the national interests of its permanent members, including a lucrative economic relationship between China and Sudan, and because of valuable Sudanese intelligence cooperation in Western counter-terrorism operations in the region. The thesis concludes that the Council&#146;s members chose to preserve these national interests at the expense of protecting civilians in Darfur.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United Nations</field><field name="subject">UN Security Council</field><field name="subject">Human Security</field><field name="subject">Humanitarian Intervention</field><field name="subject">Responsibility to Protect</field><field name="subject">Darfur</field><field name="subject">Sudan</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091112.122459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Rejang of Sumatra: Exploring Culture Through Literary Journalism</field><field name="creator">birt@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is about border crossing.  Literary Journalism is a border-crossing writing genre claiming ground in fields as diverse as science, mathematics, memoir, travel and culture. The established academic discipline of anthropology is also crossing borders as styles of writing ethnography are changing and being challenged.  This work is situated at the meeting point of these two genres. It examines how literary journalism can be used to write about culture for a wider audience beyond the academic community. 

The defining characteristics of literary journalism &#150; documentable subject, exhaustive research, novelistic writing techniques, voice and attention to underlying meaning &#150; signal strengths and possible limitations to its use in writing about culture when measured against the demands of academic ethnographic writing. The requirements for research and writing about culture are examined from the perspectives of literary journalism and ethnography in Part 1 of this thesis. 

To explore literary journalism&#146;s suitability to write about culture, research was conducted among the Rejang people of Sumatra.   Part Two of the thesis, titled Family Strength, is presented as an example of a literary journalist approach to recording culture.  It is the result of five fieldtrips to Sumatra to gather data about members of four generations of Pak Taher&#146;s family group in the village of Kelobak in the early 21st century.  Each section of Family Strength tells the story of Pak Taher&#146;s relatives, highlighting changes within the lifetime of family members, including gender roles, religious values, the influence of education, generational change and farming practices.  The work is not an exhaustive treatment of Rejang culture but records culture as several &#147;slices of life&#148;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">Rejang Sumatra</field><field name="subject">literacy journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091117.113804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action of autochthonous bacteria on the decay of enteric viruses in groundwater</field><field name="creator">tengola@gmail.com</field><field name="description">With global freshwater supplies under pressure, viable water reuse methods are being examined to assist in improving water supplies. Municipal effluent is an ideal source for water reclamation as it is consistent in quality and quantity. The health aspects of water reuse have been identified as an issue of concern, in particular the potential presence of enteric viruses. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a method that can aid water reclamation by recharging water such as treated effluent into a suitable aquifer. Research into the removal of pathogenic contaminants by natural processes within aquifers, namely the action of autochthonous bacteria, has led to the consideration that MAR could be used to assist in the removal of microbial pathogens. Pathogens have been demonstrated to be removed during residence in groundwater, but the presence of active autochthonous groundwater bacteria are required for significant removal rates to occur.

The aim of this research was to investigate the interaction between autochthonous groundwater bacteria (AGB) and the enteroviruses Poliovirus type 1, Coxsackievirus B3 and Adenovirus B41. It was established that these viruses decrease in number in the presence of AGB but the mechanisms causing this decrease are poorly understood. Experiments were designed to examine how the individual AGB caused decay of the viruses. 

In this study AGB were isolated and tested for their ability in increase the decay of the viruses. It was determined that 27 % (17/63) of the isolated AGB influenced viral decay. The AGB isolates varied in their influence with only 3 out of 17 isolates being able to cause of the decay of both poliovirus and coxsackievirus. Similar variations in decay were observed for adenovirus. Decay times for all three viruses varied amongst the AGB and between the viruses. 

Experiments were undertaken to characterise the mechanism causing the antiviral activity of four groundwater isolates (1G, 3A, 4B and 9G) under varying conditions and treatments to give insight into the compounds or mechanisms responsible for viral decay. This would indicate whether compounds produced by the AGB responsible for viral decay were closely associated to bacterial cells (perhaps membrane bound), independent of metabolic activity, heat labile or were enzymatic in nature. 

The influence of enzyme inhibiters and heat treatment indicated that viral degradation is caused by compounds that are enzymatic in nature. As viral numbers were monitored by nucleic acid copy numbers rather than via infectivity assays, the viral protein coats must be the first step in degradation followed by the removal of the viral nucleic acid. This two step process would require both protease and nuclease enzymes to result in loss of viral numbers as measured by RT-PCR/PCR.

Further characterisation and identification of these four bacterial isolates was also carried out. Three out of the four isolates were sequenced and analysed using partial 16S rRNA gene sequences to determine their phylogenetic relationships compared to related organisms. Isolate 3A was placed in the order Burkholderiales. Isolate 4B was placed in the family Xanthomonadaceae. Isolate 9G was placed in the family Rhizobiaceae. Isolate 1G was only partially sequenced and preliminary identification placed it in the phylum Bacteriodetes. 

Understanding of the processes carried out by AGB within an aquifer during MAR using reclaimed waters will aid in increasing the viability of this water reuse process. If important natural processes could be utilised to remediate any potential pathogens, the health concerns with reclaimed waters could be addressed and solved simply through prescribed retention times within the aquifer. Key species of AGB may even be utilised as markers to assess the suitability of an aquifer for MAR.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">enteric viruses</field><field name="subject">poliovirus type 1</field><field name="subject">coxsackievirus B3</field><field name="subject">adenovirus B41</field><field name="subject">antiviral</field><field name="subject">decay</field><field name="subject">RT-PCR</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="subject">autochthonous bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091117.115940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The challenge of stickiness in knowledge transfer among information and communication technology (ict) firms in Malaysian technology parks</field><field name="creator">albanjari@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">The study examines knowledge transfer between firms by using the concept of stickiness to conceptualise problems with knowledge transfer. The concept of stickiness is sub-divided into &#147;macro&#148; and &#147;micro&#148; levels stickiness. As for &#147;macro&#148; level stickiness, the study uses literature in the field of innovation studies, in which governments have been identified as major contributors to macro level stickiness. The study uses literature in the economics of knowledge and evolutionary economics to develop the concept of &#147;micro&#148; level stickiness, which refers to firms&#146; contributions to stickiness. Four factors are used to examine micro stickiness: transfer mechanisms, types of transfer, knowledge barriers, and transfer contexts. After explaining the concept of stickiness and providing a background to technology parks policy, the study examines the perceptions of a variety of informants of stickiness in knowledge transfer among ICT firms in Malaysian technology parks. The study approached seven (out of eleven) Malaysian technology parks, over a period of three months in 2005 (May-July 2005) and a month in 2007 (August 2007). It interviewed fifty (50) informants, who included policy makers, government officers, and executives of ICT firms in Malaysian technology parks. With respect to &#147;macro&#148; level stickiness, policy makers and government confirmed that the government cannot exclude previous policy documents that contained three major elements: national unity, foreign direct investment and sound economic growth to formulate policy for Malaysian technology parks, which does not solely encourage knowledge transfer because the policy documents permitted short term profit taking by ICT firms. With respect to &#147;micro&#148; level stickiness, the results suggest that transfer mechanisms, types of transfer, knowledge barriers, and transfer contexts are costly; thus, impede ICT firms from participating actively in knowledge transfer between ICT firms. This study suggests that the government and ICT firms should work closely to facilitate knowledge transfer between ICT firms in Malaysian technology parks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stickiness</field><field name="subject">knowledge transfer</field><field name="subject">ICT firms</field><field name="subject">technology parks</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091123.135305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A data driven approach to constrained control</field><field name="creator">Barry, Timothy John</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a data-driven approach to constrained control in the form of a subspace-based state-space system identification algorithm integrated into a model predictive controller.

sediment dwelling marine bivalves: a deposit feeder Tellina deltoidalis and a filter feeder
Anadara trapezia. The bivalves were exposed in the laboratory to individual metal spiked
sediments: Cadmium 10 and 50 Ag/g; lead 100 and 300 Ag/g; selenium 5 and 20 Ag/g dry
mass, T. deltoidalis for 28 days A. trapezia for 56 days. A. trapezia was also exposed in the
laboratory for 56 days to sediments from three sites along a metal contamination gradient of
cadmium, lead, selenium, zinc and copper from Lake Macquarie, NSW. Metal total tissue
dose was measured in whole tissue of T. deltoidalis over 28 days and in gill, hepatopancreas
and haemolymph tissues in A. trapezia over 56 days. Subcellular metal distribution,
biologically active metal (BAM) versus biologically detoxified metal (BDM) was measured
in whole tissues of T. deltoidalis at day 28 and in gill and hepatopancreas tissues of
A. trapezia at day 56. Biomarkers of response measured in spiked sediment exposed, at day
28 T. deltoidalis and day 56 A. trapezia were: total antioxidant capacity (TAOC); glutathione
peroxidase enzyme activity (GPx); total glutathione concentration (GSH+2GSSG); reduced to
oxidised glutathione ratio (GSH:GSSG); lipid peroxidation (TBARS); lysosomal membrane
stability and micronuclei frequency. Response indices measured in A. trapezia exposed to
Lake Macquarie sediments were: TAOC, TBARS, lysosomal membrane stability,
micronucleus frequency and condition index. Native A. trapezia and sediments were also
collected from Lake Macquarie and measured for sediment and tissue metal concentrations,
TAOC, TBARS, lysosomal membrane stability and condition index to allow comparison
between chronically exposed and previously unexposed organisms.
T. deltoidalis and A. trapezia accumulated metal over time in all sediment metal exposures
with most reaching equilibrium tissue metal concentrations by the end of the exposure period.
T. deltoidalis generally reached equilibrium with the exposure concentration for cadmium and
lead but had significantly higher selenium tissue concentrations than the sediment metal at the
5 Ag/g exposure. A. trapezia tissue lead was below the sediment concentration for all
exposures including in the native organisms. A high proportion of accumulated lead and
copper in A. trapezia was in the haemolymph, probably associated with haemoglobin which
has a high affinity for these metals`. A. trapezia cadmium tissue concentrations were higher
than the sediment metal in the 10 Ag/g spiked sediment exposure and between half and one
eighth the sediment concentrations in other treatments, including in native organisms.
A. trapezia including the native organisms exposed to selenium sediment concentrations at or
below 5 Ag/g in the Lake Macquarie mixed metal sediments accumulated significantly higher
than ambient selenium tissue concentrations while those exposed to 5 and 20 Ag/g selenium
spiked sediments had lower than ambient selenium tissue concentrations. The majority of
accumulated cadmium, selenium and zinc was associated with the gill/mantle tissues.
A. trapezia hepatopancreas contributed significant selenium concentrations in the later part of
the exposure period indicating and increased contribution from dietary derived selenium.
Native A. trapezia had significantly lower tissue concentrations of selenium, copper and zinc,
higher cadmium and approximately equal lead compared to organisms exposed to similar
sediment metal concentrations in the laboratory.
T. deltoidalis detoxified around 50 % of accumulated cadmium and 70 % of lead while
A. trapezia detoxified around 70 % of accumulated cadmium and 60 % of lead. Much of
T. deltoidalis BDM cadmium was converted to metal rich granules (MRG), while A. trapezia
had most in the metallothionein like proteins (MTLP) fraction. The conversion of lead to
MRG was 75 % of the total BDM in T. deltoidalis while A. trapezia had an even distribution
between MRG and MTLP. The majority of recovered selenium in both species was
associated with the nuclei+cellular debris fraction, probably as protein bound selenium
associated with plasma and selenium bound directly to cell walls. Selenium exposed
organisms had increased BDM selenium burdens which were associated with both MRG and
MTLP fractions, indicating selenium detoxification. The majority of BAM cadmium, lead
and selenium was associated with the mitochondrial fraction in both species with increases in
cadmium burden in this organelle of T. deltoidalis up to 7200 fold; lead 154 fold; and
selenium 7 fold and in A. trapezia up to 84 fold cadmium, 50 fold lead and selenium 7 fold in
exposed organisms compared to controls. The subcellular distribution of all three metals in
T. deltoidalis and A. trapezia indicates active metal detoxification processes which at these
exposure concentrations were unable to prevent significant metal burdens from accumulating
in sensitive organelles.
A contamination gradient of zinc, lead, copper, cadmium and selenium was established in
Lake Macquarie sediments which emanated from the same source. A. trapezia accumulated
all metals in each sediment exposure. Accumulation and tissue distribution patterns of
cadmium, lead and selenium were similar to those of the single metal spiked sediment
exposures. Cadmium and lead BAM burdens increased at all exposures while selenium, zinc
and copper did not.
T. deltoidalis and A. trapezia in the spiked sediment metal exposures generally had reduced
GPx activity. This resulted in an increase in total glutathione concentrations which the
reduced GSH:GSSG ratios indicated was due to a build up of oxidised glutathione.
T. deltoidalis and A. trapezia had reduced TAOC in all laboratory sediment metal exposures
which corresponded with increased TBARS concentrations, lysosomal destabilisation and
micronucleus frequency. A. trapezia exposed to Lake Macquarie metal contaminated
sediments also had a reduction in physiological condition, indicated by the reduced condition
index, after 56 days at the higher metal exposures.
Clear exposure - dose - response relationships have been demonstrated for T. deltoidalis and
A. trapezia exposed to single cadmium, lead and selenium spiked sediments and for
A. trapezia exposed to Lake Macquarie mixed metal contaminated sediments. Detoxification
of all metals was evident in both T. deltoidalis and A. trapezia but detoxification capacity was
exceeded for cadmium, lead and selenium leading to significant accumulation of these metals
in sensitive organelles. The significant relationships, in the laboratory exposed T. deltoidalis
and A. trapezia, between TAOC reduction with increased TBARS, lysosomal destabilisation
and micronuclei frequency and between increased TBARS with lysosomal destabilisation and
micronuclei frequency indicates that increased tissue metal dose and BAM burdens caused
significant impairment of the antioxidant reduction capacity which resulted in a cascade of
effects from lipid peroxidation to cellular perturbation and genotoxic damage. The reduction
in physiological condition in the organisms with the highest tissue metal doses suggests the
response goes beyond subcellular perturbations to whole organism and potentially population
effects.
Chronically metal exposed native Lake Macquarie A. trapezia did not show a clear metal
exposure - dose - response relationship. Accumulation of the essential elements zinc, copper
and selenium appeared to be regulated while cadmium and lead were not. TAOC was
significantly reduced and TBARS significantly increased compared to reference organisms
but lysosomal stability and condition were not significantly affected.

designer, working inside the design system or context. The designer is understood as
actor, as active agency looking inwards in a comprehensive way to examine where ideas
are located and then, how these new insights or perspective might be meaningfully
introduced. In order to develop this research, personal journal writing is employed as to
develop an understanding about how the designer/actor can actively engage with being at
once participant, and observer, of their own design practice. A series of design case
studies are carried out, where the role of the designer as actor is critically examined
through forms of personal journal writing. What this entails is the establishment of a form
of autopoetic system for writing in several voices of the self, and self-as-other working in,
and through as design project case studies. I critically evaluate these journal case studies
to inform my understanding about the design of dialogic visual communication, where
multiple perspectives of self, and self-as-other may be interwoven into the visual design
artifact. As a result of conducting this research, I propose the existence of what I term the
'conversational self' as a means for developing new knowledge and knowing through
conversational story-telling as design research. My research introduces the
'conversational self' as a generalisable theory for design research which addresses the
ways in which the designer might effectively engage with the workings of personal tools
and patterns of practice, thus building greater objectivity through recognition of local
contexts, and the role of the designer as actor and as a situated self within the design
process. My research findings describe a space for the 'conversational self' as the coming
together of three linked knowledge systems for creation and learning. I describe this
theory as 'agency-centred' design for research about design and experiential knowledge
contexts through research into the development of project case studies where individual
styles and approaches to learning and thinking which are recognised and valued as
implicit tools of and for design practice.
Firstly, the conversational journal writing format which I develop situates the designer/
researcher as both participant and observer within their design decision-making. As a
result of the uses of the journal format as a practice-based research methodology through
case studies, I observe the effect of producing what I term an 'autopoetic' (Maturana and
Varela) self-producing system, which enables me to introduce both rational and intuitive
content that works in my journal through a range of thinking styles and journal forms. My
research strategy involves the writing of several concurrent and interacting levels of
internal conversation across 'I', 'You', 'Me' and 'We' as parallel and interactive
experiential voices of self through uses of a journal format where a range of experiences
are documented as design project narratives. The conversational contexts which this
approach offers provide a means for introducing multiple perspectives from self, and selfas-
other (as designer, author, subject, agent, person) to explore topics and social
knowledge themes through a range of creative conversational learning contexts (Pask,
Glanville). In the course of developing this approach I draw on theories about personal
constructs (Kelly, Thomas and Harri-Augustein); the self as forms as agency (Archer);
about experiential learning and knowledge creation through learning conversations
(Baker, Jensen and Kolb) ; and social knowledge as networks, flows and exchange
processes (Boisot).
Secondly, as a finding from my usage of this journal format, I propose the workings of
what I describe as my 'unity of self' system construct as an enabling and generative
system for working with social knowledge and the 'self' as forms of agency through
internal conversations. Margaret Archer's theory describes the social self as forms of
causal agency active in everyday social and experiential contexts. In my case studies I
trace the internal dynamics and interactions of 'voices' of self in the journal text, which I
evaluate as the workings of conversational levels and layers which engage with a range of
details and perspectives for each project using written and non-verbal forms. The design
case study projects each describes a particular context for design practice; including
institutional, corporate, experimental, and personal design projects. In using this
methodology for journal writing, I show how I am able to explore the social interplays of
personal/public and individual/collective frameworks for design practice contexts.
Thirdly, through my evaluations of the design project case study journals, I observe the
emergence of topics and themes in each project around my understanding of the role of
context for defining the social and experiential 'materials' (Schon) of the situation. The
topics noted from conversations in design case inform what I term my 'contextual field'
as the third learning system in my findings from this research. This 'contextual field' is a
kind of topical map which provides signposts for working with social and experiential
contexts, to design 'ecological narratives' (Krippendorff) as forms of language which are
crafted as intentional and strategic design approaches, as responses to the research
process of internal reflection about the materials of the situation (Schon) Through usage
with my journal format, and unity of self construct, my contextual field topical map
provides a framework for developing topics and themes for internal conversations to
inform my design production in both 'service' and 'hand' craft project contexts. What
results are rich use case studies documented as forms of conversational story-telling
where new knowledge emerges as questions and possibilities around the design of visual
artifacts and service contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design process</field><field name="subject">design research</field><field name="subject">design development process</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091214.120656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Research Grant Funding and
Peer Review in Australian
Research Councils</field><field name="creator">Mow, Karen Estelle</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the effects of research funding process design in the
Australian Research Council (ARC) and the National Health and Medical
Research Council (NHMRC). The program delivery mechanisms that the
ARC and NHMRC use differ in detail and each council claims to be using
the best selection model possible. Neither council provides evidence that
peer review is the best possible way of delivering government funding for
research and neither can produce empirical evidence that they use the
best possible peer review model to determine excellence.
Data used in this thesis were gathered over several years, forming a
comparative case study of the Australian Research Council and the
National Health and Medical Research Council, with illustrative data from
comparable international organizations in the UK and USA. The data
collection included: a survey of applicants, semi-structured interviews
with experienced panel members and former staff, observation of selection
meetings, and examination of publications by and about the research
councils.
Researchers firmly believe in peer review and their confidence enables the
system to function. However, the mechanisms of grant selection are not
well understood and not well supported by applicants, who criticize the
processes used to assess their work, while supporting the concept of peer
selection.
The notion of excellence is problematic; judgements of excellence are made
within frameworks set by the research councils and vary across
disciplines. Allocation of research funding depends on peer review
assessment to determine quality, but there is no single peer review
mechanism, rather, there exist a variety of processes.
Process constraints are examined from the perspectives of panel members,
peer reviewers, council staff and applicants. Views from outside and inside
the black box of selection reveal the impacts of process design on
judgements of excellence and decision-making capacity. Peer reviewers in
selection panels are found to use a range of differentiating strategies to
separate applications, with variance evident across disciplines and
research councils. One dominant criterion emerges in both the ARC and
NHMRC processes, track record of the applicants.
Program delivery mechanisms enable and constrain selection but every
peer panel member has to make selection decisions by defining discipline
standards and negotiating understandings within the panel. The extent to
which peers can do this depends on the number of applications assigned
to them, the size of the applicant field, and the processes they have to
follow. Fine details of process design, panel rules and interactions are the
tools that shape funding outcomes.
Research councils believe they are selecting the best, most meritorious
proposed research. However, I show in this thesis that the dominant
discriminator between applicants in Australian selection processes is
track record of the applicant. This effect is the result of several factors
operating singly or in concert. Researcher track record, largely determined
by quality and number of journal publications, is considered to be the
responsibility of universities but support for this capacity building has not
been systematically provided in Australian universities.
Reliance on track record to determine the outcomes of all but the very best
applications is very like awarding prizes for past work and is significantly
different from the models of grant selection that operate in comparable
international research councils.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ARC</field><field name="subject">Australian Research Council</field><field name="subject">NHMRC</field><field name="subject">grant selection</field><field name="subject">research grant application</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091214.152554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guangzhou</field><field name="creator">Muir, James</field><field name="description">Seth, a savvy but shy innocent from the American mid-West, discovers the hedonism of Guangzhou when he jumps ship with the Preacher. He becomes entangled with the patriotic Snow Flake and together, they visit her remote ancestral village. But they are followed there by the shadowy figure of Lin Jun who tests Seth&#8217;s commitment to the values of his forefathers and his feelings for Snow Flake.  The novel examines what it is to be a Westerner in contemporary China through the character of Seth who, with no appropriate language skills, embarks on an adventure without morals &#8211; discarding his religious beliefs, recreating himself as his imagination sees fit and running wild with the Preacher and Snow Flake. At the same time, the novel also asks how the West should best engage China on sensitive internal issues such as the suppression of religious, spiritual, democratic and artistic movements when China grows ever stronger and more influential. This question is presented to Seth when he is totally removed from his own culture and faced with an extreme event that, even in his state of mind, is totally contrary to his own moral framework.  The exegesis discusses Seth&#8217;s dilemma from the perspective of cultural relativism - that is when can an individual from one culture declare an event which takes place in another culture to be &#8216;wrong&#8217;?  The exegesis also discusses my own dilemma of writing about a culture that is not my own and concludes that Guangzhou both asks how the West can engage China on sensitive issues and is also my response to this very question.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural relativism</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing and characterisation of nano-enhanced composites</field><field name="creator">Frederick, Armstrong</field><field name="description">Since the discovery of nanomaterials in early ninety&#8217;s, a remarkable progress in the synthesis of nanocomposites has been reported looking for a new better material with improved physical and chemical properties for a variety of applications in almost all fields. The science and technology of nanocomposites has created great excitement and expectations in the last decade too. In addition to that, researches in this area have been focusing on the nanoscale second phase embedded in the polymeric matrix that gives physical and chemical properties that cannot be achieved by ordinary material synthesis methods. Researchers have also discovered that incorporating the right amount of nanoparticles into a polymer matrix pose a remarkable strength and flexibility and that industries should be able to integrate the outcome of their researches widely in high performance applications in the field of biomedical engineering, aerospace, marine, high speed parts in engines, packaging and sports gadgets. With the new methods of synthesis and tools for characterisation, nanocomposite science and technology is now experiencing explosive growth. Taking advantage of the need and the properties of the nanomaterials, through this research a new nano-enhanced composite is developed through addition of nanofiller into epoxy matrix to cater for varied applications.  The physical and mechanical properties of the identified nanomaterial reinforced polymer composite were characterised by experimentation in order to ascertain the improvement in tensile, compressive and flexural properties as well as the adhesion of the matrix to the substrate. Also, while addressing potential enhancements like improved mechanical strength, better dimensional stability, higher thermal stability, better abrasion resistance, hard and wear resistance, better chemical properties like better flame retardance, anticorrosive and antioxidation, adequate importance was given to easy and bulk processability and most importantly the commercial viability as well. This nano-enhanced nanocomposite was then optimised. Based on these results, it has been established that epoxy reinforced with 1% percent of nanoclay can significantly improve the mechanical properties without compromising the weight or processability of the composite. Thus, a futuristic and much promising nano-enhanced epoxy composite has been successfully made ready for commercialisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nano-composites</field><field name="subject">Nano-materials</field><field name="subject">Enhancement</field><field name="subject">Properties</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation of ??-eucryptite and ??-spodumene from topaz mixtures</field><field name="creator">Lu, Hong, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The production of ??-eucryptite [LiAlSiO4] and ??-spodumene [LiAlSi2O6] from topaz [Al2SiO4(F0.64OH0.36)2, containing ~3 wt% quartz impurity] from Torrington, NSW may be of commercial importance since both lithium aluminosilicates have negative or low coefficients of thermal expansion and are used commercially as raw materials in the glass, ceramics, and metallurgical industries.  A review of the literature has revealed that the production of ??-eucryptite and ??-spodumene from topaz has not been reported before.  The aim of the present work was to determine the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of formation of ??-eucryptite from topaz + lithium carbonate mixtures and ??-spodumene from topaz + lithium carbonate + silica mixtures.  To this end, the related reactions and subsolidus phase equilibria of the Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 ternary system were determined.  The subsolidus phase equilibria for the Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 ternary system were investigated by literature assessment, experimentation, and thermodynamic calculations.  The experimentation confirmed the previously published tentative compatibility relations in the Al2O3 and the SiO2 corners.  Thermodynamic calculations were used to define the phase relations in the Li2O corner.  Thermodynamic calculations also were used to define the phase equilibria for two binary subsystems, Li2SiO3-LiAlO2 and Li4SiO4-LiAlO2.  The decomposition of topaz and formation of ??-eucryptite from topaz + lithium carbonate mixtures and ??-spodumene from topaz + lithium carbonate + silica mixtures were investigated experimentally using differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman microspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Confirmatory thermodynamic calculations also were done.  One significant finding of the present work was the formation of nanofibres from topaz + lithium carbonate mixtures at 1150???C.  These fibres were formed by gas-phase reaction of SiF4 and AlOF produced from the reaction between topaz, lithium carbonate and by reaction of SiO2 and Li(OH), which was produced by Li2O volatilisation.  These fibres, which were difficult to analyse, most likely consisted of metastable ???-spodumene solid solution or mullite in the incipient stage of formation.  Formation of single-phase ???-spodumene from topaz + lithium carbonate + silica mixtures was observed after heating above 950???C for 24 h.  Reaction paths for the formation of ??-spodumene over the temperature range 450???-1550???C were proposed.  The formation of single-phase ??-spodumene was not simple and straightforward but a complex process involving several precursor phases.  Specifically, there were two reaction mechanisms involving the formation of single-phase ???-spodumene by gas-solid reaction and gas-liquid-solid reaction.  The reaction kinetics and thermodynamics of the formation of single-phase ??-spodumene at 750???-950???C were assessed.  Essential work supplementary to that associated with the Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system consisted of determination of the decomposition mechanism of topaz, which was determined to take place in four stages.  Reaction paths for the decomposition of topaz also were proposed.  Another significant finding of the present work was the formation of transient single-crystal mullite from topaz + lithium carbonate + silica mixtures at ~600???C, which may be contrasted with the normal temperature range of 1000???-1400???C for formation from clay-based raw materials.  This phenomenon occurred via a gas-solid growth mechanism.  The present observation suggests a potential low-temperature route for the production of high-purity mullite fibres without glass contamination.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucryptite</field><field name="subject">Spodumene</field><field name="subject">Lithium silicates</field><field name="subject">Topaz</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The covariation of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and anxiety in children: a community sample</field><field name="creator">Baldwin, Jennifer S., Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is comorbid with a range of other disorders in clinical and community samples, including anxiety disorders. The outcomes of the Multimodal Treatment Studies of ADHD (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999) highlight the importance of this comorbidity, as children with anxiety responded differently to treatments than did children with ADHD only. At present there are few tested theoretical explanations of the etiological processes and developmental trajectories associated with their co-occurrence. The aim of this research was to put forward and examine different explanations for the comorbidity of these two disorders in children according to the framework provided by Lilienfeld (2003). This was achieved by examining the covariation of ADHD symptoms and anxiety symptoms in a community sample of 499 children aged 8-13. Dimensional assessments of psychopathology were conducted via self-report questionnaires given to children, parents and teachers. The results were analysed via structural equation modelling approaches using AMOS (Arbuckle, 2003). Consistent with the hypotheses, positive associations at Time 1 between ADHD and anxiety symptoms were linked with inattention symptoms and were particularly pronounced for girls. The concurrent positive associations observed at each time period could not be completely accounted for by overlapping symptoms across measures or by method covariance explanations. The link between ADHD and anxiety symptoms could be explained by a common factor in reporting whereby ADHD and anxiety symptoms were both associated with noncompliance and negative affect for parents' reports, and negative affect for children???s' reports. Despite the concurrent associations, there was no support for the hypothesis that ADHD symptoms predicted the development of anxiety  symptoms over time, nor the alternative hypothesis that anxiety symptoms predicted the development of ADHD symptoms over time, when the stability of symptoms across time was taken into account. It was concluded that ADHD symptoms (particularly inattention) and anxiety symptoms are covarying phenomena that are linked with common features of an irritable temperament and disruptive behaviour. Future research should investigate the role of these common factors in treatment outcome and cognitive research, which has previously found differences between ADHD children with and without anxiety.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="subject">Anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">Comorbidity</field><field name="subject">Child psychopathology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyurethane organosilicate nanocomposites for novel use as biomaterials</field><field name="creator">Styan, Katie, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Polymer organosilicate nanocomposites have attracted significant attention over the last decade due to improved mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. Several nanocomposite researchers have recognised potential for biomedical applications, however none have conducted biological investigations. In this project, the predicted ability of the organosilicate to enhance biostability, modulate the release of included drugs, and confer biofunctionality and control over the host response, were assessed as the three primary hypotheses. The studies were conducted with the objective being employment as urinary device biomaterials. Of prime importance was that no detrimental change in cytocompatibility was resultant. Biomedical thermoplastic elastomeric polyurethane organosilicate nanocomposites were prepared from poly(ether)urethane of 1000g/mol poly(tetramethylene oxide) polyol, 4,4??? diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and 1,4 butanediol chain extender chemistry, and various organosilicates with loadings from 1w% to 15w%, using a solution casting technique. Initially, partially exfoliated nanocomposites were produced using a commercially available organosilicate, Cloisite?? 30B. These nanocomposites displayed several advantageous properties, namely i) significant anti-bacterial activity, reducing S. epidermidis adherence after 24h to ~20% for a 15w% organosilicate loading, ii) enhanced biostability, with a 15w% organosilicate loading displaying only slight degradation after a 6 week subcutaneous in vivo ovine implantation, and iii) static modulation of model drug release as a factor of drug properties and organosilicate loading. The former was attributed to the Cloisite?? 30B quaternary ammonium compound, while the latter two were likely primarily barrier effect related and due to changes to poly(ether)urethane permeability. Electrostatic and chemical interactivity between drug and organosilicate was also implicated in the observed drug release modulation. Unfortunately, a lack of in vitro cytocompatibility and poor in vivo inflammatory response will limit in vivo use. Utilising bioinert 1-aminoundecanoic acid as an alternative organic modification, cytocompatible intercalated nanocomposites were produced thus likely allowing in vivo nanocomposite use and exploitation of the barrier effect related properties. However, these nanocomposites were not antibacterial. Variation of the organic modification and/or use of co-modification were viable means of modulating host response and biofunctionality, however nanoscale dispersion of co-modified silicate was poor. Use of nanocomposite technology was concluded beneficial to existing biomaterials, and specifically to biomaterial application as urinary catheters / stents.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymeric composites</field><field name="subject">Biomedical materials</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative studies on different enzyme preparations for (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol production</field><field name="creator">Satianegara, Gernalia, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present study is part of a project to develop a high productivity enzymatic process for (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC), a precursor for the pharmaceuticals ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, with recent interest for a low cost and more stable biocatalyst pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) preparation. PDC initially added in the form of Candida utilis cells, viz. whole cell PDC, showed higher stability towards substrate benzaldehyde and temperature in comparison to the partially purified preparation in an aqueous/benzaldehyde emulsion system. Increasing the temperature from 4?? to 21??C for PAC production with whole cell PDC resulted in similar final PAC levels of 39 and 43 g/L (258 and 289 mM) respectively from initial 300 mM benzaldehyde and 364 mM pyruvate. However, the overall volumetric productivity was enhanced by 2.8-fold. Enantiomeric excess values of 98 and 94% for R-PAC were obtained at 4?? and 21??C respectively and benzylalcohol (a potential by-product from benzaldehyde) was not formed. The potential of whole cell PDC was also evident in an aqueous/octanolbenzaldehyde emulsion system at 21??C with a 3-fold higher specific production compared to partially purified PDC. At 2.5 U/mL, PAC levels of 104 g/L in the organic phase and 16 g/L in the aqueous phase (60 g/L total reaction volume, 15 h) and a 99.1% enantiomeric excess for R-PAC were obtained with whole cell PDC. The study of cell membrane components provided a better understanding for the enhanced performance of whole cell PDC in comparison to partially purified PDC. It was apparent that surfactants, both biologically-occurring (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) and synthetically manufactured (e.g. bis(2-ethyl-1-hexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT)), enhanced PDC stability and/or PAC production in the aqueous/octanol-benzaldehyde biotransformation system with the partially purified enzyme. Addition of 50 mM AOT to the biotransformation with partially purified PDC enhanced the enzyme half-life by 13-fold (19 h) and increased specific PAC production by 2-fold (36 mg/U). Chemical modification studies targeting the amino and carboxyl groups were carried out to achieve increased stability of partially purified PDC. However these were not successful and future work could be directed at PDC protein engineering as well as optimization and scale up of the two-phase process using whole cell PDC.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enzymes</field><field name="subject">Cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dense gas particle processing for alternative drug delivery formulations</field><field name="creator">Tandya, Andrian, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pulmonary and oral drug administrations are usually the preferred methods of delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients.Generally,pulmonary drug formulations are more attractive compared to oral formulations since they consist of micron-sized powders with high surface area thus having faster onset of action,as well as minimizing the drug dosage and side effects.Oral insulin formulations,if achievable,would provide an alternative to injectable insulin,as the common drawbacks of injectable insulin are the multiple daily injections and the possibility of skin infections at the injection site. In this study,the feasibility of using dense gas particle processing techniques known as the Aerosol Solvent Extraction System (ASES),Gas Anti-Solvent (GAS)and High-Pressure Media Milling (HPMM)for pharmaceutical processing was assessed.The ASEStechnique,utilizing dense ethane,was employed to prepare insulin-lactose formulations for pulmonary administration whilst the GAS and ASES techniques,utilizing dense CO2,were employed to prepare microencapsulated formulations containing insulin and Eudragit?? S100 for oral administration.Furthermore,the HPMM technique,utilizing dense hydrofluocarbon (HFC)134a/227ea,was employed to prepare suspension Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI)formulations containing budesonide and various surfactants. The Fine Particle Fraction (FPF)of processed insulin without the presence of lactose was found to be 44%.In other words,44% of processed insulin delivered to the impactor stages (excluding the throat and neck)has aerodynamic diameter of less than 5??m.With the addition of lactose as carrier,the FPFof the insulin-lactose (1:1w/w)formulation increased to 64%.The increase in FPFwas attributed to the lower density of lactose particles compared to that of insulin particles to produce an intimate mixture with enhanced powder flowability and aerodynamic performance.

It then goes on to suggest that a deeper engagement with the nondualistic doctrines Naess embraced could lift environmental philosophy out of the Cartesian framework in which it appears to be bogged down. Deep Ecology has been accused of being politically ineffective, and letting down the environmental movement, because it remains insufficiently engaged with debates concerning power, class, sex, and other hegemonies that occupy the minds of social ecologists, ecofeminists, and cultural studies theorists. I argue that Deep Ecology is not as ineffective as detractors claim, but that it remains philosophically undeveloped, and has not provided sound foundations for environmental ethics. The qualified nondualism I advance, based on Ved??nta, the work of David Bohm, and (to a lesser extent) Platonic thought, treats cosmos, society and the individual as intelligent creative systems in which the interrelated parts are expressions of a vital generative order to which each is actively related. The Self is a mirror of the cosmos, engaged in the process of becoming a more complete reflection of the totality. In all of this the nature of consciousness as vast creative intelligence is paramount, and freedom dominates the entire process from beginning to end. This thesis offers an opportunity to rethink ideas of value, moral considerability, and the nature of the empirical self, from a nondualistic perspective. It proposes that "intrinsic unity" might replace the community as the foundational moral concept for environmental ethics. In the process, emphasis shifts away from the objective sphere and settles firmly on the thinker and thought. Following Bohm and Krishnamurti, I argue that conditioned thought is the only barrier to (inner) freedom and creativity. Most important, the metaphysics of nondualism privileges processes of universal Self-realisation, and reveals the limitations of the empirical self. Understanding thought as a process then becomes something of a moral imperative.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deep ecology - Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and valuing multivariate interdependencies in financial time series</field><field name="creator">Milunovich, George, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates implications of interdependence between stock market prices in the context of several financial applications including: portfolio selection, tests of market efficiency and measuring the extent of integration among national stock markets.

MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy-methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assay performed on human cells (HepG2 and Skin fibroblasts). The project included the development of a method for extracting contaminants from soil based on leaching and centrifugation. A number of solvents and surfactants were assessed for their suitability as extracting agents. The Zwitterionic surfactant CHAPS ({3[(3-Cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio] propanesulphonic acid}), which is an irritant in vivo, was found suitable for in vitro toxicity assessment applications. CHAPS was found to be the least toxic surfactant in vitro when tested on skin fibroblasts (NOEC: 1800??577 ppm, IC50: 4000??577 ppm) and HepG2 cells (NOEC: 833??289 ppm, IC50: 5300??287 ppm). The chosen surfactant was used in three different methods for extraction of Toluene and Xylene spiked in 2 g and 10g soil. The combination comprising of 0.1% (s/w) CHAPS and cosolvent 1% (w/w) Isopropanol, at their respective NOEC (No Observed Effective Concentration) toxicity values, showed good recovery of the nonpolar organic compounds in comparison to the recovery by 0.1% CHAPS and 0.5% CHAPS. The study found additive interactions to be the most common form of toxicity for 16 concentration combinations of Formaldehyde (polar), Toluene and Xylene (nonpolar) when compared to predicted toxicity (R2=0.943, P&amp;lt0.0001). When assessing the in vitro toxicity of unknown (blind) contaminated soil samples, the Hazard Index (HI) predicted from the chemical analyses results showed a relatively good correlation (R2&amp;gt0.7062, n=26) when compared to the experimental toxicity results on HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the comparison of Australian Health Investigation Levels (HIL) with in vitro toxicity testing gave similar correlation (R2&amp;gt0.6882, n=26) on HepG2 cells. The overall project suggests the potential application of the zwitterionic surfactant (CHAPS) in sampling contaminants from soils in an in vitro toxicity assessment.

The growth has fueled the realization of many peer-to-peer networks in both academia and the commercial arena. Peer-to-peer networks generally fall into one of these categories ??? centralized systems with server-like entities in the network; unstructured systems with random topology and message routing, and structured systems with deterministic topology and routing behavior. Surveying the major peer-to-peer networks in each category, one can conclude that the each of the categories exhibit very different characteristics and properties from one another. This thesis addresses the problems in the peer-to-peer networking space by employing two overarching principles. Firstly, desirable properties of systems in one category can be adopted by another to achieve restructuring. In short, restructuring involves the injection of structure into unstructured networks and conversely loosening the rigidity in structured systems. Secondly, as much as possible, participating peers in the network are designed to be homogeneous in functionality recognizing that they are heterogeneous in capabilities. True to the concept of the peer-to-peer paradigm, this principle keeps participants functioning as fellow peers rather than imposing hierarchical differences in the roles within the network. We describe three contexts in which the issues pertaining to the peer-to-peer networks in view can be addressed by applying the principle of restructuring. For the Mobile Agent Peer-to-Peer architecture, we adopt centralized concepts into the unstructured peer-to-peer network while maintaining homogeneity in functionality through the use of mobile agents. The architecture shields excessive traffic from peers with limited resources and allows more capable peers to share others??? burden. Through the use of mobile agents, logical hierarchy is avoided and thus the second overarching principle of homogeneity is preserved. For Gnutella Clusters, concepts from the structured systems are adopted to facilitate the formation and maintenance of clustering in unstructured networks. Clustering limits the amount of flooding in the network and thus conserves bandwith. The clustering algorithm is decentralized to all peers, and does not need a set of participants to have special functionality ??? thus preserving the generic nature of all peers. In Autonomic Decentralized Service Directory platform, structure is released from the underlying Chord network to provide better support for service registration and searching. The strict requirements for deterministic routing and lookup which characterize structured systems are granted some leniency for the ability to avoid misbehaving nodes and provide incentives for peers to behave properly.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">Business networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating the source, geochemical sinks and aqueous mobilisation processes of naturally occurring arsenic in a coastal sandy aquifer</field><field name="creator">O???Shea, Bethany Megan, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elevated arsenic concentrations have been reported in a drinking water and irrigation-supply aquifer of Stuarts Point, New South Wales, Australia. Arsenic occurrence in such aquifers is potentially a major issue due to their common use for high yield domestic and irrigation water supplies. Ten multi-level piezometers were installed to depths of approximately 30 m in the sand and clay aquifer. Sediment samples were collected at specific depths during drilling and analysed for chemical and mineralogical composition, grain size characteristics, potential for arsenic release from solid phase and detailed microscopic features. From this data, a full geomorphic reconstruction allowed the determination of source provenance for the aquifer sediments. The model proposed herein provides evidence that the bulk of the aquifer was deposited under intermittent fluvial and estuarine conditions; and that all sediments derive from the regional arsenicmineralised hinterland. More than 200 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for over 50 variables. The heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments causes redox stratification to occur, which in turn governs arsenic mobility in the groundwater. The bulk of the aquifer is composed of fluvial sand deposits undergoing reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Arsenic adsorbed to iron oxide minerals is released during dissolution but re-adsorbs to other iron oxides present in this part of the aquifer. The deeper, more reducing fluvial sand and estuarine clay groundwaters have undergone complete reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in the subsequent mobilisation of arsenic into groundwater. Some of this arsenic has been incorporated into iron sulfide mineral precipitates, forming current arsenian pyrite sinks within the aquifer. The extraction of groundwater from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water supply induces seawater intrusion of arsenic-rich estuarine water, bringing further dissolved arsenic into the aquifer. A greater understanding of the source, sinks and mobilisation of arsenic in this aquifer contributes to our broad understanding of arsenic in the environment; and allows aquifer specific management procedures and research recommendations to be made. Any coastal or unconsolidated aquifer that has sediments derived from mineralised provenances should consider monitoring for arsenic, and other potentially toxic trace elements, in their groundwater systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of high intensity exercise on fat loss in young overweight women</field><field name="creator">Trapp, Ethlyn Gail, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the effect of high intensity, intermittent exercise (HIIE) on fat loss in young, sedentary women. It attempted also to identify possible mechanisms underpinning exercise-induced changes in adiposity. Study 1 investigated some of the metabolic and hormonal responses to two variations of HIIE. Sixteen female subjects were tested. The first session involved a cycle ergometer VO2peak test. The next two sessions were completed in random order. After baseline measures the women did 20 min of HIIE. There was a short bout exercise of 8 s work, followed by 12 s relative rest and a long bout exercise of 24 s work followed by 36 s relative rest. Seven subjects had excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and resting metabolic rate determined. Both exercise modalities made significant demands on the participants??? oxygen delivery systems. RER diminished over the 20 min of exercise and plasma glycerol concentrations increased. Lactate concentrations rose. Catecholamine concentrations were elevated postexercise. There was an elevated EPOC associated with above baseline fat utilisation. Study 2, a 15-week training study, was a randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of short bout HIIE and steady state (SS) exercise on fat loss. Forty-five women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: HIIE, SS, or control. Preliminary and posttraining testing included a DEXA scan and a VO2peak test including blood collection. All participants completed 3-d diet diaries and maintained their current diet for the course of the study. Participants exercised three times a week for the next 15 weeks under supervision. The HIIE group did 20 min of HIIE (8 s work:12 s rest)  at a workload determined from the VO2peak test. The SS group cycled at 60%VO2peak , building to a maximum of 40 min exercise. Both exercise groups increased VO2peak . The HIIE group had a significant loss of total body mass (TBM) and fat mass (FM) when compared to the other groups. There was no change in dietary intake. There have been a number of studies examining the acute effects of HIIE but, to our knowledge, this is the first study examining the chronic effects of this particular exercise protocol.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Overweight women</field><field name="subject">Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Exercise tests</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal dusting of iron and low alloy steel</field><field name="creator">Yin, Maggie Huaying, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Metal dusting is a kind of catastrophic corrosion phenomenon that can be observed in several of petrochemical processes. It occurs on iron-, nickel- and cobalt-base metals in carbonaceous atmospheres at high temperature when gaseous carbon activity is higher than one. The process is particularly rapid for ferritic alloys  The aim of this project was to compare the dusting kinetics of pure iron and a 2.25Cr-1Mo alloy steel under CO-H2-H2O atmosphere at 650??C.  Polished (3??m) samples of iron and the steel were exposed to flowing CO-H2-H2O gas atmospheres at 650??C, when the gases were supersaturated with respect to graphite. The partial pressure of CO was varied between 0.25 and 0.9 atm, and the carbon activity was varied from 2.35 to 16, in order to obtain a series of experimental conditions. In most experiments, pO2 was less than 7.37E-24 atm, and no iron oxide could form. However, Cr2O3 would always have been stable. When exposed to these gases, both iron and steel developed a surface scale of Fe3C which was buried beneath a deposit of carbon, containing iron-rich nanoparticles (the dust). Examination by Scanning Electron Microscopy allowed the observation of fine and coarse carbon nanotubes, and also spiral filaments. However, the morphology of the graphitic carbon was not sensitive to pCO and aC. Moreover, the carbon deposit was gas permeable, allowing continuing gas access to the underlying metal.  At a fixed=4.5, the carburizing rate clearly increased with CO content from 0.25 to 0.68 atm. However, increasing the CO content to higher value led to decreased rates, indicating that carburizing rate reaches a maximum value at pCO=0.68 atm. When pCO was fixed at 0.25 atm and 0.68 atm, and carbon activity was varied. The induction period was extended by the formation of protective oxide layers at low values of carbon activity (aC= 2.35 and 2.55) where pO2 exceed the iron oxide formation value. For other reaction conditions, the carbon uptake rate for iron and steel did not increase with aC. The present work showed that the carbon deposition rates were not proportional to pCO or pCOpH2. Instead, the rate was affected by the partial pressure of all three reaction gases, and the carbon uptake rate for both materials could be expressed at r=k1pCOpH2+k2pCO2+k3pH22 and the rate constant k3 has a negative value, corresponding to coke gasification.  From XRD analyses, it was found that cementite was the only iron-containing phase in the dusting product. The cementite particles acted as catalysts for carbon deposition from the gas. The same deposition process at the surface of the cementite layer led to its disintegration, thereby producing the particles. This disintegration process was faster on the steel than on pure iron. Consequently, the rates of both metal wastage and coke accumulation were faster for the steel.  It is concluded that chromium and molybdenum do not stabilize the carbide but accelerate its disintegration process. It is suggested that Cr2O3 fine particles in the cementite layers provide more nucleation sites in the cementite layer on steel, explaining its more rapid dusting kinetics. However, appropriate methods of proving this assumption, such as TEM and FIB, are required.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plates, Iron and steel</field><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Corrosion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Y1 receptor for NPY: a novel regulator of immune cell function</field><field name="creator">Wheway, Julie Elizabeth, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Psychological conditions, including stress, compromise immune defenses. Although this concept is not novel, the molecular mechanism behind it remains unclear. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), regulates anxiety and is a part of the stress response. The NPY system also modulates immune functions such as cytokine release, cell migration, and innate immune cell activity. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves innervating lymphoid organs release NPY, which together with other peptides activate five receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and y6). Additionally, immune cells themselves release NPY following activation. Previous studies have shown that Y1 mediates NPY-immune effects and data presented here shows expression of Y1 on a wide range of immune cells. Results presented in this thesis, using Y1-deficient mice (Y1-/-), have uncovered a novel role for Y1 on immune cells. NPY acts endogenously to inhibit T cell activation whereas Y1-/- T cells are hyper-responsive to activation and trigger severe colitis after transfer into lymphopenic mice. Thus, signalling through the Y1 receptor on T cells inhibits T cell activation and controls the magnitude of T cell responses. Paradoxically, in Y1-/- mice, T cell differentiation to Th1 T cells appears to be defective as these mice were resistant to T helper type 1 (Th1) cell???mediated inflammatory responses and showed reduced levels of the Th1 cell???promoting cytokine interleukin 12 and reduced interferon ?? production. This defect was due to functionally impaired antigen presenting cells (APCs). Y1-deficient APCs are defective in their ability to produce Th1-promoting cytokines and present antigens to T cells and consequently, Y1-/- mice had reduced numbers of effector T cells. Key reciprocal bone marrow chimera experiments indicated that this effect is intrinsic to immune cells and not driven by other Y1-expressing cell types. These results demonstrate a fundamental bimodal role for the Y1 receptor in the immune system, serving as a strong negative regulator on T cells as well as a key activator of APC function. The findings presented in this thesis uncover a sophisticated molecular mechanism regulating immune cell functions and thus adds to a growing number of signalling pathways shared by the immune and nervous system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuropeptides</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the epiphytic bacterial community associated with the green alga Ulva australis</field><field name="creator">Tujula, Niina Amanda, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Epiphytic bacterial communities on the surfaces of marine algae are poorly characterised. Most information available on marine bacterial epiphytes is derived from culture-based studies. With the rapid development of molecular community analysis technologies, it is now possible to obtain a more comprehensive picture of marine microbial populations on living surfaces. The intertidal macroalga Ulva australis, belongs to the cosmopolitan group of green marine algae (Ulvales) known to require the presence of bacteria for normal growth and has been suggested to employ specific bacteria for the defence against fouling by micro- and macro-organisms. This thesis has examined the composition and structure of the surface associated bacterial community on Ulva australis using 16S rRNA gene clone library, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and catalysed reporter deposition ??? fluorescence in situ hybridisation (CARD-FISH) analysis. The 16S rRNA gene clone library revealed that the five main bacterial groups present in the surface associated community were Bacteriodetes, Planctomycetes, Alpha-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacteria. Twenty-two sequence phylotypes were identified, suggesting that the epiphytic community was of relatively low diversity. A clone similar to an algal morphogenesis inducing Cytophaga strain was identified, indicating that U. australis harbours bacteria important for thallus structural maintenance. DGGE analysis showed that while the bacterial community varied over spatial and temporal (seasons) scales it also included a stable subpopulation consistently associated with the seaweed surface. Sequencing of selected DGGE bands suggested that members of the Alphaproteobacteria and the Bacteriodetes belonged to the stable subpopulation. Using CARD-FISH with different phylogenetic probes demonstrated that Alphaproteobacteria (~ 70%) and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (~13%) constituted the majority of bacterial cells on the surface of U. australis. A comparison of the results provided by the molecular community analysis methods, employed in this thesis, and those of culturing of epiphytic bacteria from U. australis revealed that each approach provides different patterns of phylogeny and extent of diversity. For example, the culture collection and the clone library detected a relatively high amount of Gammaproteobacteria, however, DGGE and CARD-FISH did not. Also, low  species diversity clone sequences and isolates of Alphaproteobacteria contrasted with the high numbers detected by the DGGE analysis. In addition to the phylogentic determination of the epiphytic bacterial community, CARDFISH was also used to assess the organisation and distribution of bacterial cells across different zonal regions on seaweed surface. It was found that approximately 40% of bacterial cells clustered in aggregates, or microcolonies. These aggregations were considered to be heterogeneous in composition and were mainly comprised of multiply species. The occurrence of more non-viable solitary single rather than aggregated cells suggests that aggregates might offer greater protection to bacterial cells from the harsh conditions in the intertidal zone. More broadly, CARD-FISH was found to be a useful tool for studying microcolonies and was also successfully applied to detect slow growing soil microcolonies cultivated using a novel soil substrate membrane system culturing technique without the need to perform an rRNA enrichment incubation. The findings in this thesis, as described from the application of a number of molecular community analysis techniques such as clone library, DGGE and CARD-FISH, have improved our understanding of the diversity and structure of the epiphytic bacterial community associated with U. australis. Morevover, the information provided may to design future studies in the ecology of bacteria-seaweed interactions, including symbiotic interactions, and aid in marine biotechnology applications such as identifying bacteria which produce bioactive secondary metabolites.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Green algae</field><field name="subject">Marine bacteria</field><field name="subject">Epiphytes</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of imperfect mixing in suspended plant and animal cell cultures</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Caleb Kin Lok, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A common problem observed in large-scale cell cultivation is reduced culture performance compared with small-scale processes due to the existence of concentration gradients caused by poor mixing. Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading the writings of contemporary Indonesian Muslim women writers: representation, identity and religion of Muslim women in Indonesian fictions</field><field name="creator">Arimbi, Diah Ariani, Women's &amp; Gender Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">Indonesian Muslim women???s identity and subjectivity are not created simply from a single variable rather they are shaped by various discourses that are often competing and paralleling each other. Discourses such as patriarchal discourses circumscribing the social engagement and public life of Muslim women portray them in narrow gendered parameters in which women occupy rather limited public roles. Western colonial discourse often constructed Muslim women as oppressed and backward. Each such discourse indeed denies women???s agency and maturity to form their own definition of identity within the broad Islamic parameters. Rewriting women???s own identities are articulated in various forms from writing to visualisation, from fiction to non fiction. All expressions signify women???s ways to react against the silencing and muteness that have long imposed upon women???s agency.  In Indonesian literary culture today, numerous women writers have represented in their writings women???s own ways to look at their own selves.  Literary representations become one group among others trying to portray women???s strategies that will give them maximum control over their lives and bodies.  Muslim women writers in Indonesia have shown through their representations of Muslim women in their writings that Muslim women in Indonesian settings are capable of undergoing a self-definition process. However, from their writings too, readers are reminded that although most women portrayed are strong and assertive it does not necessarily mean that they are free of oppression. The thesis is about Muslim women and gender-related issues in Indonesia.

This study aimed to systematically explore the cultural beliefs and behavioural practices that appear to place ethnic Vietnamese IDUs at increased risk of BBV infection, identify barriers to this group accessing health and preventive programs, and document antibody HIV and HCV prevalence and associated risk behaviours. The first component of the research consisted of an ethnographic study designed to explore underlying explanatory models of health and illness employed by Vietnamese IDUs and identify cultural influences on risk behaviours and vulnerability to BBVs. These data were subsequently used to inform the development of the instrument used in the second component ??? a cross-sectional survey and collection of capillary blood samples designed to assess risk behaviours and antibody HIV and antibody HCV prevalence. Analysis of data from both components indicates that cultural beliefs and practices influence risk-taking and health-seeking behaviours and suggests pathways through which this influence occurs. Relevant cultural characteristics include those pertaining to spiritual and religious beliefs, the role of the family and traditional Vietnamese family values, cultural scripts of self-control and stoicism, the importance of ???face??? and non-confrontational relationships, trust and obligation, and a reluctance to discuss problems with outsiders. Vulnerability to BBVs is influenced by these cultural characteristics, together with Vietnamese IDUs??? perceptions of risk, knowledge about HIV and HCV, and situational and environmental factors. Main factors contributing to the under-utilisation of health services include the use of self-managed care practices, ambivalence surrounding Western medicine, long waiting times, concerns in relation to confidentiality, stigmatisation of drug use, and limited knowledge of BBVs. The data indicate a need for interventions based on understanding of culturally specific meanings and contexts of health, illness and risk in order to better meet the needs of this vulnerable group.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural characteristics</field><field name="subject">cultural influences</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">injecting drug use</field><field name="subject">hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">overdose</field><field name="subject">traditional medicine</field><field name="subject">health services accessibility</field><field name="subject">prevalence</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Staying bush??? ??? a study of gay men living in rural areas</field><field name="creator">Green, Edward John, School of Social Work, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explored the experience of what it is to be a gay man and to live in a rural community. It sought to understand why gay men would want to live in places that are said to have a reputation for hostility towards them. The empirical data from the semi-structured interviews with twenty-one gay men living in fifteen small-town locations across New South Wales, Australia, was analysed using a qualitative method derived from phenomenology, ethnography and modified grounded theory. The distinctive findings of this thesis centre on these men???s desire and determination to stay in the bush. They chose to stay in rural locations and effectively employed a diverse range of strategies to both combat the difficulties of rural life and enhance its advantages. The bush was the place in which these men could find themselves, be themselves and also find others like themselves. The space and the isolation of the bush gave them the latitude and the scope to live gay lives. This is why they stayed. By staying, they were also able to live out both the homosexual and rural components of their personal and social identity. Building on a brief look at the Australian rural past, the conceptual framework utilises notions of ???the stranger??? and draws on resilience, agency and resistance theory to understand these men???s ability to live in an unwelcoming place. Resilience allowed these men to cope and deal with the difficulties they faced. Human agency, the individual's capacity to exert autonomy over his life, is used to restore prominence to resistance theory. Agency is the catalyst to resistance and resistance fuels an individual???s, and sometimes a collective, opposition to the dominant social forces that inhibits one???s agency. These men???s desire to live in a rural place can be understood through theoretical considerations of place, the freedom of place and queer theory. Their satisfaction with life can be theorised through the application of a concept new to theory in gay literature - thriving. This thesis documents a largely unreported aptitude and proficiency by rural gay men to live in the bush. It suggests that their close affinity with place gives them a sense of belonging that, when combined with their concept of a gay lifestyle, effectively queers the places in which they live. That gay men can live fulfilled lives in the very places they are said to have fled evokes an innovative perspective together with an appreciation of what it is to be gay in the bush.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gay men -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural gay men -- New South Wales -- Interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioprocess development for (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) synthesis in aqueous/organic two-phase system</field><field name="creator">Gunawan, Cindy, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">(R)-phenylacetylcarbinol or R-PAC is a chiral precursor for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. PAC is produced through biotransformation of pyruvate and benzaldehyde catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) enzyme. The present research project aims at characterizing a two-phase aqueous/organic process for enzymatic PAC production. In a comparative study of several selected yeast PDCs, the highest PAC formation was achieved in systems with relatively high benzaldehyde concentrations when using C. utilis PDC. C. tropicalis PDC was associated with the lowest by-product acetoin formation although it also produced lower PAC concentrations. C. utilis PDC was therefore selected as the biocatalyst for the development of the two-phase PAC production. From an enzyme stability study it was established that PDC deactivation rates in the twophase aqueous/octanol-benzaldehyde system were affected by: (1) soluble octanol and benzaldehyde in the aqueous phase, (2) agitation rate, (3) aqueous/organic interfacial area, and (4) initial enzyme concentration. PDC deactivation was less severe in the slowly stirred phase-separated system (low interfacial area) compared to the rapidly stirred emulsion system (high interfacial area), however the latter system was presumably associated with a faster rate of organic-aqueous benzaldehyde transfer. To find a balance between maintaining enzyme stability while enhancing PAC productivity, a two-phase system was designed to reduce the interfacial contact by decreasing the organic to aqueous phase volume ratio. Lowering the ratio from 1:1 to 0.43:1 resulted in increased overall PAC production at 4??C and 20??C (2.5 M MOPS, partially purified PDC) with a higher concentration at the higher temperature. The PAC was highly concentrated in the organic phase with 212 g/L at 0.43:1 in comparison to 111 g/L at 1:1 ratio at 20??C. The potential of further two-phase process simplification was evaluated by reducing the expensive MOPS concentration to 20 mM (pH controlled at 7.0) and employment of whole cell PDC. It was found that 20??C was the optimum temperature for PAC production in such a system, however under these conditions lowering the phase ratio resulted in decreased overall PAC production. Two-phase PAC production was relatively low in 20 mM MOPS compared to biotransformations in 2.5 M MOPS. Addition of 2.5 M dipropylene glycol (DPG) into the aqueous phase with 20 mM MOPS at 0.25:1 ratio and 20??C improved the production with organic phase containing 95 g/L PAC. Although the productivity was lower, the system may have the benefit of a reduction in production cost.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enzymes - Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Ephredine</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Chemistry, Organic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday narratives - reconsidering filmic temporality and spectatorial affect through the quotidian</field><field name="creator">Rassos, Effie, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis takes as its focus the relation between particular constructions of filmic time and the resulting affective and emotional experiences these temporalities produce on a spectatorial level. This connection between time and affect is thought through more specifically here in relation to an idea of the everyday not only as a thematic concern with the minutia of routine daily existence but also as distinct, and yet shifting, conceptions of filmic and viewing time. While film studies has often approached the temporal construction of the quotidian through the rubric of ???real time,??? I explore different articulations of the everyday in a number of film practices through the writings of Henri Lefebvre. As a sociologist and philosopher preoccupied with the revolutionary quality of everyday time in both material reality and art practices including film, Lefebvre???s work enables this thesis to approach film as an especially potent and significant site for affective experiences of time and of the everyday. Beginning with John Cassavetes??? Faces (1968) and an analysis of an affective everyday temporality that film is able to produce as a temporal medium, this thesis goes on to consider the quotidian through photography and stillness in Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (Chantal Akerman, 1975), dying and witnessing via Silverlake Life: The View from Here (Tom Joslin and Peter Friedman, 1993), and finally melodrama and unrequited love in Wong Kar-wai???s In the Mood for  Love (Huayang Nianhua, 2000). In the analysis of these films and videos, this thesis draws on film debates explicitly concerned with time as well as focusing on those places in philosophy and critical theory where a promising and productive articulation of film and its inscription of time and affect can be found and conceptualised. In this investigation, the everyday as both a temporal construction and a spectatorial affective experience is a means to reflect on the cinema as a continually shifting and dynamic affective site.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time in motion pictures</field><field name="subject">Motion picture audiences</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures - Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures - Aesthetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extentions of functional calculus for Banach space operators</field><field name="creator">Terauds, Venta, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">We consider conditions under which a continuous functional calculus for a Banach space operator T ??

The natural setting for investigating the former case is finitely spectral operators, and for the latter, well-bounded operators.  Some such conditions are well-established. If X is a reflexive space, both type of Extensions are assured; in fact if X contains an isomorphic copy of co, then every Operator T ?? L(X) that has a continuous functional calculus necessarily admits a Borel one. We show that if a space X has a predual, then also every operator T ?? L(X) with a continuous functional calculus admits a bounded Borel functional Calculus.  In case a Banach space X either contains an isomorphic copy of co, or has a Predual, and T ?? L(X) is an operator with an AC functional calculus, we find that the existence of a decomposition of the identity of bounded variation for T is sufficient to ensure that the AC functional calculus may be extended to a BV functional calculus.  We also consider operators defined by a linear map on interpolation families of Banach spaces [Xr, X???] (r???1), where for example Xp = lp, Lp[0,1] or Cp.

The thesis broadened its scope with inclusion of non-ornithorhynchid Mesozoic monotremes from Lightning Ridge, NSW. This change in direction brought an unexpected result: a fossil mammal from Lightning Ridge investigated for this thesis (presumed to be monotreme: Flannery et al., 1995) appears to be a new and unique type of mammal. Specimens were procured through Queensland Museum (Riversleigh material); Australian Museum (Lightning Ridge material); and Museum of Victoria and the South Australian Museum (fossil ornithorhynchids). Specimens were examined under a light microscope and scanning electron microscope; specimens were photographed using light photography and a scanning electron microscope; and illustrations and reconstructions were done with a camera lucida microscope attachment and photographic references. Parsimony analysis utilised the computer programs PAUP and MacClade. Major conclusions: 1) analysis and reconstruction of the skull of the Miocene platypus Obdurodon dicksoni suggest this robust, large-billed platypus was a derived northern offshoot off the main line of ornithorhynchid evolution; 2) the well-preserved skull of Obdurodon dicksoni shows aspects of soft anatomy previously unknown for fossil ornithorhynchids; 3) two upper molars from Mammalon Hill (Etadunna Formation, late Oligocene, central Australia) represent a third species of Obdurodon; 4) the South American ornithorhynchid Monotrematum sudamericanum from the Paleocene of Argentina is very close in form to the Oligocene-Miocene Obdurodon species from Australia and should be considered congeneric; 5) a revised diagnosis of the lower jaw of the Early Cretaceous monotreme Steropodon galmani includes the presence of two previously undescribed archaic features: the probable presence of postdentary bones and a meckelian groove; 6) morphological evidence is presented supporting a separate family Steropodontidae; and 7) analysis of new fossil material for Kollikodon ritchiei suggests that this taxon is not a monotreme mammal as originally identified but is a basal mammal with close relationships to allotherian mammals (Morganucodonta; Haramiyida). Kollikodon is provisionally placed as basal allotherian mammal (Allotheria sensu Butler 2000) and is unique at the ordinal level, being neither haramiyid nor multituberculate.

Kollikodonta ??? is proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ornithorhynchidae</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Monotremes</field><field name="subject">Mammals, Fossil</field><field name="subject">Paleontology - Mesozoic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A late quaternary palaeoenvironmental investigation of the fire, climate, human and vegetation nexus from the Sydney basin, Australia</field><field name="creator">Black, Manu, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is widely believed that Australian Aboriginals utilised fire to manage various landscapes however to what extent this impacted on Australia???s ecosystems remains uncertain. The late Pleistocene/Holocene fire history from three sites within the Sydney Basin, Gooches Swamp, Lake Baraba and Kings Waterhole, were compared with archaeological and palaeoclimatic data using a novel method of quantifying macroscopic charcoal, which is presented in this study. The palynology and other palaeoecological proxies were also investigated at the three sites. The Gooches Swamp fire record appeared to be most influenced by climate and there was an abrupt increase in fire activity from the mid-Holocene perhaps associated with the onset of modern El Ni??o dominated conditions. The Kings Waterhole site also displayed an abrupt increase in charcoal at this time however there was a marked decrease in charcoal from ~3 ka. Lake Baraba similarly had displayed low levels of charcoal in the late Holocene. At both Kings Waterhole and Lake Baraba archaeological evidence suggests intensified human activity in the late Holocene during this period of lower and less variable charcoal. It is hence likely that at these sites Aboriginal people controlled fire activity in the late Holocene perhaps in response to the increased risk of large intense fires under an ENSO-dominated climate. The fire history of the Sydney Basin varies temporally and spatially and therefore it is not possible to make generalisations about pre-historic fire regimes. It is also not possible to use ideas about Aboriginal fire regimes or pre-historic activity as a management objective. The study demonstrates that increased fire activity is related to climatic variation and this is likely to be of significance under various enhanced Greenhouse scenarios. There were no major changes in the composition of the flora at all sites throughout late Pleistocene/Holocene although there were some changes in the relative abundance of different taxa. It is suggested that the Sydney Sandstone flora, which surrounds the sites, is relatively resistant to environmental changes. Casuarinaceae was present at Lake Baraba during the Last Glacial Maximum and therefore the site may have acted as a potential refugium for more mesic communities. There was a notable decline in Casuarinaceae during the Holocene at Lake Baraba and Kings Waterhole, a trend that has been found at a number of sites from southeastern Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paleobiogeography - Australia</field><field name="subject">Paleoclimatology - Australia</field><field name="subject">Nature - Effect of human beings on - New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Paleoecology - Quaternary</field><field name="subject">Paleobotany - Quaternary</field><field name="subject">Paleoethnobotany</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid development of problem-solvers with HeurEAKA! - a heuristic evolutionary algorithm and incremental knowledge acquisition approach</field><field name="creator">Bekmann, Joachim Peter, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A new approach for the development of problem-solvers for combinatorial problems is proposed in this thesis. The approach combines incremental knowledge acquisition and probabilistic search algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms, to allow a human to rapidly develop problem-solvers in new domains in a framework called HeurEAKA. The approach addresses a known problem, that is, adapting evolutionary algorithms to the search domain by the introduction of domain knowledge. The development of specialised problem-solvers has historically been labour intensive. Implementing a problem-solver from scratch is very time consuming. Another approach is to adapt a general purpose search strategy to the problem domain. This is motivated by the observation that in order to scale an algorithm to solve complex problems, domain knowledge is needed. At present there is no systematic approach allowing one to efficiently engineer a specialpurpose search strategy for a given search problem. This means that, for example, adapting evolutionary algorithms (which are general purpose algorithms) is often very difficult and has lead some people to refer to their use as a ???black art???. In the HeurEAKA approach, domain knowledge is introduced by incrementally building a knowledge base that controls parts of the evolutionary algorithm. For example, the fitness function and the mutation operators in a genetic algorithm. An evolutionary search algorithm ismonitored by a human whomakes recommendations on search strategy based on individual solution candidates. It is assumed that the human has a reasonable intuition of the search problem. The human adds rules to a knowledge base describing how candidate solutions can be improved, or why they are desirable or undesirable in the search for a good solution. The incremental knowledge acquisition approach is inspired by the idea of (Nested) Ripple Down Rules. This approach sees a human provide exception rules to rules already existing in the knowledge base using concrete examples of inappropriate performance of the existing knowledge base. The Nested Ripple Down Rules (NRDR) approach allows humans to compose rules using concepts that are natural and intuitive to them. In HeurEAKA, NRDR are significantly adapted to form part of a probabilistic search algorithm. The probabilistic search algorithms used in the presented system are a genetic algorithm and a hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm. The success of the HeurEAKA approach is demonstrated in experiments undertaken on industrially relevant domains. Problem-solvers were developed for detailed channel and switchbox routing in VLSI design and traffic light optimisation for urban road networks. The problem-solvers were developed in a short amount of time, in domains where a large amount of effort has gone into developing existing algorithms. Experiments show that chosen benchmark problems are solved as well or better than existing approaches. Particularly in the traffic light optimisation domain excellent results are achieved.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Problem solving - Computer programs</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Traffic lights - Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes to safety and organisational culture in Australian military aviation</field><field name="creator">Falconer, Boyd Travis, School of Aviation, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes original research that examines the extent to which organisational culture, and psychosocial aspects specifically, relate to individuals??? ???normal??? performance within Australian Defence Force (ADF) aviation. The primary rationale for the research relates to the ???safety record??? of ADF aviation, whereby more than fifty ???peace time??? fatalities have occurred in ADF aviation accidents since 1990 and many of these have links to organisational culture attributes. The secondary rationale relates to a more general perspective: previous research identifies human functioning in military aviation ??? more than any other aviation domain ??? as being dependent upon psychosocial attributes including interpersonal collaboration, communication and coordination. However, the depth to which such qualities impact the safety of a sociotechnical system remains substantially uncharted.  This thesis firstly examines both scientific and Australian military literature on organisational behaviour, culture and human factors. Subsequently, it describes the design and implementation of a new 45-item questionnaire ??? the Australian Defence Force Aviation Questionnaire (ADFAQ). More than four hundred ADF aircrew and engineers completed the ADFAQ. The data analysis involved quantitative and qualitative consideration of survey responses and comparisons between numerous demographic criteria. Following this, the thesis describes the design and implementation of an interview study that was designed to both cross-examine key ADFAQ results and explore more deeply other issues that were only superficially identified by the (largely psychometric) composition of the ADFAQ.  The research results offer three main contributions to scientific knowledge. These relate to: (1) the efficacy of triangulated and contextualised methodology in building an understanding of organisational culture; (2) the nature of the safety culture concept and its relationship with organisational culture; and (3) rank-based homogeneity of attitudes. This research shows that survey methodologies are not a panacea, but they can illuminate the nature of attitudes to safety and provide empirical guidance for other methods to explore more deeply the cultural roots of such attitudes and associated behaviours.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aeronautics, Military - Safety measures - Australia</field><field name="subject">Airplanes, Military - Accidents - Australia</field><field name="subject">Aircraft accidents - Human factors - Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What matters inside organizations: a multiple climates approach to understanding business-unit effectiveness</field><field name="creator">MacCormick, Judith S., Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">My aim in this thesis is to improve understanding of the contributions of organizational climate to organizational effectiveness. Climate is defined as the shared perceptions of the work environment (Schneider &amp; Reichers, 1983). First, I developed and empirically validated four targeted climates ??? climates for involvement; mission-alignment; consistency; and adaptability ??? reflecting a broad range of management perspectives. These climates are based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh???s Competing Values Framework (1983a), and extend the work of Patterson et al. (2005). Using secondary data from 2027 business-units from diverse industries, worldwide, these climates were, as expected, inter-related, yet distinct. Second, I explored the relationships between multiple climates and stakeholder outcomes (staff motivation, perceived customer loyalty and perceived business performance) using structural equation modeling and discriminant function analysis. Separate but matched manager and employee samples from 620 business-units were used to assess relationships linking the four climates and three effectiveness outcomes within a single model. The findings indicated that employees??? perceptions of workplace characteristics influence important organizational outcomes. Overall, key findings were: (1) a climate for mission related directly to perceived business performance; (2) climates for consistency and adaptability both related to higher business performance through their positive link with customer loyalty; (3) a climate for involvement also related to business performance, but only when the context was uncertain; (4) while climates for involvement and mission related to staff satisfaction, staff satisfaction did not uniquely predict business performance; (5) the most effective business-units, with high scores on all three outcomes, had a balance of high levels of all four climates. The thesis discusses the implications of these results for both theory and practice, as well as suggestions for future research. In particular, the comprehensiveness and empirical integrity of this multiple-climates model indicates its potential to provide new insights about the relationships between perceived organizational characteristics and outcomes. Furthermore, my research suggests that organizations can foster high levels of all four climates concurrently, and in doing so achieve better outcomes for a diversity of stakeholders. This has implications for change management: specifically that organizations should embed and integrate multiple approaches concurrently rather than move from one to the next.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban poverty and adaptations of the poor to urban life in Dhaka City, Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Hossain, Md. Shahadat, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores urban poverty and the adaptations of the urban poor in the slums of the megacity of Dhaka, Bangladesh. It seeks to make a contribution to understanding and analysis of the phenomenon of rapid mass urbanisation in the Third World and its social consequences, the formation of huge urban slums and new forms of urban poverty. Its focus is the analysis of poverty which has been overwhelmingly dominated by economic approaches to the neglect of the social questions arising from poverty. This thesis approaches these social questions through an ???urban livelihood framework???, arguing that this provides a more comprehensive framework to conceptualise poverty through its inclusion of both material and non-material dimensions. The study is based on primary data collected from slums in Dhaka City. Five hundred poor households were surveyed using a structured questionnaire to investigate the economic activities, expenditure and consumption, access to housing and land, family and social networking and cultural and political integration. The survey data was supplemented by qualitative data collected through fifteen in-depth interviews with poor households. The thesis found that poverty in the slums of Dhaka City was most strongly influenced by recent migration from rural areas, household organisation, participation in the ???informal??? sector of the economy and access to housing and land. Almost half of the poor households in the study locations were identified as ???hardcore poor???, that is having insufficient income for their physical needs. The remainder were found to be ???absolute poor???, those who experienced poverty and vulnerability but varied in their levels of income and consumption. This level of poverty was also characterised by their social, cultural and political marginalisation. In summary, the urban poor remain very much dependent on their household and social networking, the main social capital they use to adapt to life in Dhaka City. Overall, the urban poor in this study experience the highest level of poverty and vulnerability in their everyday life. The thesis argues that the experience of poverty in the megacity of Dhaka for these households follows the pattern of urbanisation without development, the very opposite to their expectations and aspirations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poor - Bangladesh - Dhaka</field><field name="subject">Poverty - Bangladesh - Dhaka</field><field name="subject">Poverty - Developing countries</field><field name="subject">Dhaka (Bangladesh) - Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Dhaka (Bangladesh) - Surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless network caching scheme for a cost saving wireless data access</field><field name="creator">Wang, Jerry Chun-Ping, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent widespread use of computer and wireless communication technologies has increased the demand of data services via wireless channels. However, providing high data rate in wireless system is expensive due to many technical and physical limitations. Unlike voice service, data service can tolerate delays and allow burst transfer of information, thus, an alternative approach had to be formulated. This approach is known as ???Infostation.??? Infostation is an inexpensive, high speed wireless disseminator that features discontinuous coverage and high radio transmission rate by using many short-distance high bandwidth local wireless stations in a large terrain. As opposed to ubiquitous networks, each infostation provides independent wireless connectivity at relative  shorter distance compare to traditional cellular network. However, due to the discontinuous nature of infostation network, there is no data service available between stations, and the clients become completely disconnected from the outside world. During, the disconnected period, the clients have to access information locally. Thus, the need for a good wireless network caching scheme has arisen.   In this dissertation, we explore the use of the infostation model for disseminating and caching of data. Our initial approach focuses on large datasets that exhibit hierarchical structure. In order to facilitate information delivery, we exploit the hierarchical nature of the file structure, then propose generic content scheduling and cache management strategies for infostations. We examine the performance of our proposed strategies with the network simulator Qualnet. Our simulation results demonstrate the improvement in increasing the rate of successful data access, thus alleviating excessive waiting overheads during disconnected periods. Moreover, our technique allows infostations to be combined with traditional cellular networks and avoid accessing data via scarce and expensive wireless channel for the purpose of cost reduction.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infostation</field><field name="subject">wireless caching</field><field name="subject">infostation-cellular integration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-angular hyperspectral data and its influences on soil and plant property measurements: spectral mapping and functional data analysis approach</field><field name="creator">Sugianto, ., Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the spectral reflectance characteristics of soil and vegetation using multi-angular and single view hyperspectral data. The question of the thesis is ???How much information can be obtained from multi-angular hyperspectral remote sensing in comparison with single view angle hyperspectral remote sensing of soil and vegetation???? This question is addressed by analysing multi-angular and single view angle hyperspectral remote sensing using data from the field, airborne and space borne hyperspectral sensors. Spectral mapping, spectral indices and Functional Data Analysis (FDA) are used to analyse the data. Spectral mapping has been successfully used to distinguish features of soil and cotton with hyperspectral data. Traditionally, spectral mapping is based on collecting endmembers of pure pixels and using these as training areas for supervised classification. There are, however, limitations in the use of these algorithms when applied to multi-angular images, as the reflectance of a single ground unit will differ at each angle. Classifications using six-class endmembers identified using single angle imagery were assessed using multi-angular Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) imagery, as well as a set of vegetation indices.  The results showed no significant difference between the angles. Low nutrient content in the soil produced lower vegetation index values, and more nutrients increased the index values. This research introduces FDA as an image processing tool for multi-angular hyperspectral imagery of soil and cotton, using basis functions for functional principal component analysis (fPCA) and functional linear modelling. FDA has advantages over conventional statistical analysis because it does not assume the errors in the data are independent and uncorrelated. Investigations showed that B-splines with 20-basis functions was the best fit for multi-angular soil spectra collected using the spectroradiometer and the satellite mounted CHRIS. Cotton spectra collected from greenhouse plants using a spectrodiometer needed 30-basis functions to fit the model, while 20-basis functions were sufficient for cotton spectra extracted from CHRIS. Functional principal component analysis (fPCA) of multi-angular soil spectra show the first fPCA explained a minimum of 92.5% of the variance of field soil spectra for different azimuth and zenith angles and 93.2% from CHRIS for the same target. For cotton, more than 93.6% of greenhouse trial and 70.6% from the CHRIS data were explained by the first fPCA. Conventional analysis of multi-angular hyperspectral data showed significant differences exist between soil spectra acquired at different azimuth and zenith angles. Forward scan direction of zenith angle provides higher spectral reflectance than backward direction. However, most multi-angular hyperspectral data analysed as functional data show no significant difference from nadir, except for small parts of the wavelength of cotton spectra using CHRIS. There is also no significant difference for soil spectra analysed as functional data collected from the field, although there was some difference for soil spectra extracted from CHRIS. Overall, the results indicate that multi-angular hyperspectral data provides only a very small amount of additional information when used for conventional analyses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multi-angular</field><field name="subject">CHRIS hyperspectral</field><field name="subject">functional data analysis</field><field name="subject">spectral mapping</field><field name="subject">reflectance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A surface forces and protein adsorption study of grafted PEO layers</field><field name="creator">Hamilton-Brown, Paul, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A combination of surface analytical techniques, colloid probe Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to optimise the grafting density of covalently attached 5, 20 and 40 kDa methoxy-terminated PEO layers (under marginal solvation (cloud point) conditions for the PEO molecules). The combination of these techniques allowed us to relate the PEO layer density and molecular conformations to the range, magnitude and types of forces generated by coatings of various grafting densities. The key optimisation parameter was the grafting time with the concentration of PEO in solution having a weaker effect. Oxidation of the substrate occurred, but did not significantly limit the surface density of the functional groups used to chemically attach the PEO molecules. Interactions between the substrate and silica were electrostatic in origin and did not contribute to the interaction between silica and the PEO surfaces due to salt screening effects Surfaces with dense, highly stretched PEO layers (brushes) generated purely repulsive forces at all separation distances, arising from compression by the silica spherical probe used. The force profiles for lower density surfaces comprised long-ranged attractive and short-ranged repulsive forces. The attractive forces were most likely due to attractive bridging interactions between the PEO chains and the SiO2 surface. For low grafting densities, i.e. inter-chain grafting distances, s &amp;gt ??RF, the PEO layers were not strongly stretched and free to adsorb onto the opposing silica surface. XPS analysis demonstrated that HSA and Fibrinogen adsorbed onto low density 20 kDa PEO coatings (s &amp;gt ??RF), most likely via diffusion through the PEO layer. No protein adsorption was found (detection limit &amp;gt 10 ng/cm2) on high density, ???strongly stretched brush??? coatings (s &amp;lt ?? RF). Analysis of data from the more sensitive Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) techniques indicated that low amounts of adsorbed HSA, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and IgG were present on high density 20 and 40 kDa surfaces; the most likely explanation being attractive interactions between the proteins and the PEO layers during the protein adsorption experiments. ToF-SIMS data obtained for the strongly stretched (s &amp;lt ?? RF) 5 kDa PEO surfaces suggested that no protein was adsorbed, in line with the XPS data for the same surfaces.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Proteins</field><field name="subject">Adsorption</field><field name="subject">Polyethylene oxide</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between self-efficacy and self-regulated behaviour within a secondary school music technology based creative learning environment.</field><field name="creator">Merrick, Bradley Maxwell, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study employed the theoretical framework of Albert Bandura???s social cognitive theory, to investigate how differing levels of self-efficacy impact on both the type and degree of self-regulatory behaviour employed by the students when composing music in a high school music program. The literature review revealed an abundance of related research suggesting a strong relationship between self-efficacy and self-regulated behaviour in the ???core??? academic domains of education. In contrast, there was no specific research found that had examined self-efficacy and self-regulation in the context of students composing music.  An independent school in Sydney served as the research site, with sixty-eight students of varied year levels and musical experience participating in the study. Students used stand alone computers, the software ???Cubase??? and MIDI keyboards as they completed a task that involved creating an original piece of music in a genre of their own choice, over a series of four composition sessions.  A mixed methodology was employed to determine if the influence of the students??? self-efficacy beliefs upon their self-regulation in a creative activity were consistent with existing research. Data were collected using a mixture of weekly measures and self-report scales, combined with a variety of questionnaires, logs, tally sheets and interviews. Eight variables, including the self-regulatory sub-processes of goal setting-strategic planning, intrinsic motivation, goal orientation, task expectation, time on task, task completion, monitoring were analysed together with an additional variable, defined as creative ability, to determine if evidence could be found of a relationship between self-efficacy and these specific behaviours while composing.  The results suggest that the pre-task (Week 1) measure of self-efficacy was closely associated with the students??? use of the eight self-regulatory dimensions as well as their perceived level of creative ability. Weekly self-efficacy measures also suggested that students??? employ self-regulated sub-processes proportionally to their respective levels of self-efficacy. Importantly, the more efficacious students employed a wider and more sophisticated repertoire of self-regulated behaviour when composing in contrast to the less efficacious students. Self-efficacy was also identified as a key factor amongst students who were initially identified as being naive self-regulators, but who through the duration of the task, modified their behaviour to become more skilful self-regulators. Throughout the study, the consistent level of interaction between self-efficacy and the use of self-regulated behaviours were aligned with findings in the core ???academic??? disciplines of education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social cognitive theory</field><field name="subject">self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">self-regulation</field><field name="subject">secondary school music</field><field name="subject">music technology</field><field name="subject">MIDI</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">composition</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">strategic planning</field><field name="subject">goal setting</field><field name="subject">intrinsic motivation</field><field name="subject">goal orientation</field><field name="subject">task expectation</field><field name="subject">time on task</field><field name="subject">task completion</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">self-reflection</field><field name="subject">sequencer</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Islamic revivalism: a study of the Tablighi Jamaat in Sydney</field><field name="creator">Ali, Jan Ashik, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the great Iranian revolution of 1978-79, there has been a significant increase in Islamic consciousness and activity in Muslim communities across the globe. As a phenomenon it has become known as ???Islamic revivalism???. Its hallmark is a return to Islamic origins, the fundamentals of the faith embodied in the Qur???an and the sunnah (sayings and practices of Prophet Muhammad). Contemporary Islamic revivalism has its roots in Muslim responses to European colonialism and imperialism at the turn of the twentieth century, when the darker sides of modernity began to reveal themselves in what was perceived as less than desirable social, cultural, economic, and political conditions of many Muslim communities and societies. Islamic revivalism has constantly featured in Islamic history and is by no means a new phenomenon. What distinguishes contemporary Islamic revivalism from earlier revivalisms is its complex multifacetedness as a defensive reaction to a new epoch of modernity described in revivalist circles as jahiliyah (ignorance). This thesis argues there is a central relationship between modernity and Islamic revivalism. Using in-depth interviews and participant observation techniques this study is an ethnography of the Tablighi Jamaat (Preaching Party), a transnational Islamic revivalist movement active in Sydney. It also seeks to locate the Tablighi Jamaat in the spectrum of Australian Islam. The principal argument of the thesis is that contemporary Islamic revivalism is a defensive reaction to modernity. Contrary to popular belief it neither constitutes an antimodernity nor does it seek to destroy modernity. Rather, it highlights that Muslims as adherents to a revealed tradition - Islam - are in a serious state of crisis. They are confronted with both material crisis and the threat of losing their faith and identity in modernity. Through a study of the Tablighi Jamaat the thesis argues that contemporary Islamic revivalism is, therefore, an attempt to rescue Muslims from their modern malaise through selective use of modern ideological and technical means.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic renewal</field><field name="subject">Islam - New South Wales - Sydney</field><field name="subject">Globalization - Religious aspects - Islam</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous optimization of beam positions for treatment planning and for image reconstruction in radiotherapy</field><field name="creator">Widita, Rena, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">From one treatment to the next, considerable effort is made to accurately position radiotherapy patients according to their treatment plans. However, some variation is unavoidable. The target volume and the organs at risk may also move within the patient and/or change shape during the treatment. Thus, it is important to be able to verify the success of the treatment by determining the position of patient and the dose deposited in the patient at each fraction. One possibility to achieve this, particularly when equipment, time and budgets are limited, would be to collect limited information while the patient is on the treatment couch. This research was aimed to develop a method for optimum beam position determination, for each patient-specific case. The optimized beam positions would balance the both treatment planning and image reconstruction, so that the patient???s image can be obtained during the treatment delivery using the information collected from the same angles as used for treatment. This will allow verification of the dose deposited in the patient for every fraction. Using a limited number of angles for image reconstruction, the dose to the patient can be minimized. This work has two major parts, beam position optimization for image reconstruction and beam position optimization for treatment planning. These two optimizations are then combined to obtain the optimum beam position for both image reconstruction and treatment planning. An objective function, projection correlation, was developed to investigate the image reconstruction method using limited information. Another objective function, the average optimization quality factor, was also introduced to optimize beam positions for treatment planning. Two optimization methods, the gradient descent method and the simulated annealing based on these objective functions were used to determine the beam angles. The results show that the projection correlation presents several advantages. It can be applied without any iterations, and it produces a fast algorithm. The present research will allow selection of the optimum beam positions without excessive computational cost for treatment planning and imaging. By combining the projection correlation and the average optimization quality factor together with more advanced image reconstruction software this could potentially be used in a clinical environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beam optics</field><field name="subject">Imaging systems in medicine</field><field name="subject">Radiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creativity in the bioglobal age: sociological prospects from seriality to contingency</field><field name="creator">Huthnance, Neil Peter, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is the first dedicated sociological attempt to offer a critical response to cultural studies and allied discourses that concern themselves with the relationship between technology and violence. A critical reconstruction is necessary because these cultural theorists have failed to adequately contextualize their arguments in relation to both the globally ascendant neoliberal policy outlook and its associated social Darwinian technoculture: the combined pernicious effects of which could be described as the logic of ???social constructionism as social psychosis???. The most prominent manifestation of this theoretical psychosis has to do with an interest in biotechnology in particular. The problem I identify in the treatment of this theme is how easily it can be used to support a technologically determinist position. One undesirable side effect is that these determinists are able to project from present trends a dystopian exhaustion of all critique through their focus on violence. In the thesis of ???bioglobalism??? this state of affairs is also deployed to take sociologists to task for insufficient recognition of processual ???network??? forms of distributed agency in technological processes. At stake therefore is the recovery of sociological critique. It follows that the core of my thesis is the radical reworking of two related heuristic devices: seriality and contingency. Seriality is taken to refer to social practices as diverse as the possible relationships between the social problem of rationality, case studies of individuals who have run amok, and the functioning of network characteristics. I use contingency to eschew seriality???s deterministic accounting of the social. Here I propose a new conceptual relationship between creativity and action. Emphasis is accordingly placed upon two related normative projects: Raymond Williams???s cultural materialism, and three of the ???problematiques??? Peter Wagner has identified as inescapable for theorizing modernity: the continuity of the acting person, the certainty of knowledge, and the viability of the political order. I conclude with a renewed conception of the role of normative critique as a form of conceptual therapy for bioglobal projections of seriality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative ability - Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Technology - Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Social change</field><field name="subject">Biology - Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Crime - Sociological aspects</field><field name="subject">Contingency (Philosophy)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifetime monitoring of appliances for reuse</field><field name="creator">Mazhar, Muhammad Ilyas, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Environmental awareness and legislative pressures have made manufacturers responsible for the take-back and end-of-life treatment of their products. Therefore, manufacturers are struggling to find ways to recover maximum value from returned products. This goal can best be achieved by promoting multiple reuse programs as reuse is one of the most effective ways to enhance a sustainable engineering economy. Since the essential goal of the reuse strategy is to reuse parts, the reliability of used parts becomes a core issue. Research indicates that reuse is technologically feasible, associated with a significant manufacturing cost saving, and it does not compromise product quality. However, it is not easy to be applied in reality. There are several uncertainties associated with reuse, the most common is the uncertainty of the product???s quality after use. A widespread implementation of the reuse strategy could be triggered, subject to the availability of reliable methods to assess the useful remaining life of parts. The evolution of such a methodology would play a pivotal role in making decisions on the supply chain process and the recovery value of returned products. Reliability assessment by life cycle data analysis is the basis of this research. The proposed methodology addresses the problem of reliability assessment of used parts by considering two important aspects. It performs statistical as well as condition monitoring data analysis for decision-making on reuse. The analysis is carried out in two stages. Firstly, a wellknown reliability assessment procedure, the Weibull analysis, is applied to analyse time-tofailure data to assess the overall reuse potential of components. In the second stage, the used capacity (actual life) of components is determined by analysing their operating history (condition monitoring data). The linear and nonlinear regression analysis, Kriging procedures and artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed in this stage. Finally, the Weibull analysis and ANNs are integrated to estimate the remaining useful life of components/assemblies of a product at the end of its first life cycle. The model was validated by using life cycle data from consumer products.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="subject">Recycled products</field><field name="subject">Production engineering - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Industrial management - Environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ontological status of Pirandello???s metacharacters: six characters in search of a Platonic author</field><field name="creator">Sarrinikolaou, Irene, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes that a defining feature of Pirandello???s 1921 play ??? Six Characters in Search of an Author, is a relentless transcendentalism. It argues that the play embodies a fascination with existential and conceptual ???occult???, and my hypothesis is that by exploring Pirandello's transcendentalism we may enhance our understanding of how and why Pirandello's play points a mirror up to the invisible and suggests that we could be a reflection of that. Pirandello's drama alludes to some of the most convoluted and enduring debates in western philosophy. However, there is very little English-language material on Pirandello???s relation to philosophy or the relevance of analytical philosophy, metaphysics or epistemology to Pirandello???s playwriting. Even foreign-language studies focus on existentialism, phenomenology and other Continental traditions of philosophy. My contribution is to craft a subjective response to Six Characters in accordance with the methods of analytical philosophy, making use of paradigms and techniques that stem from aesthetics and metaphysics to elucidate a complex self-reflexive play. Chapter One presents analytical philosophy as a potential interpretative framework for the play, whereas chapters two and three explore the metacharacters specifically.

Upon temperature downshift the synthesis of Csp proteins is drastically increased to enable cells to restore growth in the cold. These proteins facilitate transcription and translation at low temperature by functioning as RNA chaperones. Csp proteins have been most extensively studied in Bacteria but very few Csp homologues have been identified and studied in Archaea. This is the first study examining structural, functional and biophysical properties of Csp from the Antarctic archaeon Methanogenium frigidum. The fastidious growth requirements of M. frigidum make it difficult to cultivate, therefore recombinant methods have been developed for the expression and characterization of the protein. The analysis by transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis (TUG-GE) revealed that M. frigidum Csp folds by a reversible two-state mechanism and has a low conformational stability. The spectroscopic analysis of the protein performed by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy disclosed features typical of other homologous proteins. A possible association between Csp and RNA has been proposed according to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. The effect of a Nterminal polyhistidine affinity tag on the biophysical properties of Csp was also examined. The biological activity of Csp was investigated by complementation of an E. coli cold sensitive mutant. These studies revealed that the M. frigidum Csp is biologically active and can function in E. coli.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteins</field><field name="subject">Archaebacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Donne???s Holy Sonnets and Calvin</field><field name="creator">Chong, Kenneth Tze Aun, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Criticism on Donne???s Holy Sonnets has traditionally been concerned with trying to find an explanation for the doubt, anxiety, and despair that is often expressed by the speaker of those poems. In recent decades, critics have increasingly made recourse to Calvinist theology in an effort to explain these melancholy states of mind. The accounts that such critics provide of ???Calvinism,??? however, have been varied and largely inadequate, mainly because they fail to engage with Calvin???s work at the level it requires. My thesis seeks to correct such deficiencies by providing a detailed reading of Calvin???s view on salvation and the way in which it is received. Calvin argues that we obtain salvation through a firm and certain faith, a faith that is nevertheless attacked by the unbelief that still resides in the believer. In other words, there is a division between the flesh and the spirit within the soul of the believer, which means that he or she is never free (until death) from the sinful temptations of this life. This division, which Calvin invokes to reconcile the uncertainties of the Christian life with the assurance of faith, is dramatised in the Holy Sonnets. In the five poems that I analyse, the speaker is torn between a desire for righteousness and an inclination toward evil, a division that is also represented in the structural qualities of the text. The various temptations which the speaker registers and confronts (and often falls to) are, I believe, a demonstration of Calvin???s view that the regenerate person is in continuous warfare against the remnants of the flesh.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Donne, John, 1572-1631 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Sonnets, English -- History and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation of erosion in variably saturated clay soils</field><field name="creator">Lim, Seok San, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The erosion behaviour of clay soils has been investigated through a comprehensive program of laboratory testing. Three different erosion test methods have been employed including the rotating cylinder test (RCT), the hole erosion test (HET), and the slaking test (SLT). A new rotating cylinder test device is designed and manufactured capable of testing disturbed and undisturbed soil samples in saturated and unsaturated states. Details of the equipment along with its calibration, testing and sampling procedures are provided. The HET has been reviewed and modified to provide consistent test results. In addition, the slaking test has been customised to accept samples identical to those used in the RCT. A total 111 RCT, 139 HET, and 108 slaking tests have been conducted and analysed. Typical shapes of the erosion curves are identified, based on a wide range of shear stresses and erosion rates analysed. Correlations are presented between the RCT and HET, and between the RCT and SLT to allow characterisation of clay soil erosion in a consistent and unified manner. The erosion modes of clay soils are investigated and categorised into three main groups: ???dispersive erosion???, ???saturated non-dispersive erosion???, and ???unsaturated non-dispersive erosion???. It is shown that soils falling in the same category exhibit near identical erosion characteristics. Factors affecting clay soil erodibility are investigated and displayed for each erosion mode.

Few studies combine the following three aspects: 1) an examination of learner Korean; 2) the provision of substantial linguistic and pedagogical explanations; and 3) the devising of teaching or learning strategies based on empirical evidence. By studying KFL learners and their language production, insights can be gained relating to the learning of KFL and instructors will be able to provide appropriate corrective measures. This study investigated errors produced by KFL learners, focusing primarily on high frequency orthographic, lexical and grammatical errors in written language production. The study attempts to identify key areas of difficulty in learning Korean, to investigate the possible cause of difficulties and to provide more adequate information for the teaching and learning of KFL. To this end the study uses two classes of textual data and employs both statistical and descriptive analyses. At an orthographic level the study has identified four main error categories: 1) mismatch in three series consonants, 2) mismatch in vowel sounds, 3) misuse of nasals and laterals, and 4) omission and addition of ???h???. Overall the cause of key error types correlates strongly with the differences in sound quality and sound patterns between Korean and English, with some intralingual features. At a lexical level, the study found nine types of errors including 1) semantic similarity, 2) lexical misselection and 3) overgeneralization. The findings suggest that learners have a great deal of difficulty in differentiating lexical items with similar meaning and in selecting words appropriate to particular contexts or situations. As for grammatical errors, the study identified the five most active error categories, which made up more than 80% of the total grammatical errors. An overwhelming majority of grammatical errors and case particle errors in particular were errors of substitution. Many high frequency grammatical errors had distinctive triggering factors such as particular types of verb and sentence construction. The findings of the study have several pedagogical implications. First, there are key common errors for English L1-KFL learners and these common errors need increased linguistic and pedagogical attention. Secondly, the results reinforce the need to pay more active attention to the usage of the main case particles, along with the triggering constructions causing substitutions. Thirdly, the findings suggest that different types of analysis should be done in order to facilitate a plausible description of the problematic KFL items. The study argues that despite being problematic, the items discussed in this thesis are learnable and worthy of being taught with explicit or intentional strategies and that there is a need for pedagogically effective and adequate instructional input to maximize the potential of the learner???s language development in Korean.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Korean language - Study and teaching - Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Korean language - Errors of usage</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indoor air quality and post-disaster public housing: a case study of a Japanese post-disaster public housing on the effect of VOC emissions from building materials</field><field name="creator">Hirota, Keiko, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the beginning of the 20th century indoor air has produced distinctive pollution problems. The most critical pollutants in relation to indoor air quality (IAQ) are chemical contaminants which, in the form of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have been identified as arising mainly from building materials. Conventional solutions such as ventilation systems and bake-out processes have been developed, but the IAQ problem, often reported as sick building syndrome (SBS), still persists. This study set out to establish to what extent VOCs may affect the health of occupants in a particular built environment, and how much architectural design factors, the use of particular building materials, and human activities may contribute to the problem of SBS. A further question was to establish to what extent current attempted solutions to IAQ problems, namely ventilation and bake-out, were in practice effective in a specific built environment. While previous research and attempted solutions have focused on work places as areas of concern for SBS, the problem is especially significant in residential housing and is particularly concentrated in post-disaster public housing (PDPH). For this reason the research was based on the case of a PDPH project in Abuta, Japan. To analyse the separate components of the problem, several distinct studies were undertaken. The level of pollutants in the air was analysed by means of chemical sampling of VOCs in two units of the PDPH, while the a SBS survey and assessment of the residents of the entire project, as well as interviews with the building professionals involved was designed to identify the human causes and effects of the situation. The effectiveness of the attempted solutions to the problem were considered by means of a study of the bake-out procedure, and finally an airflow simulation by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was conducted to consider the design and ventilation features of the units in relation to IAQ. The study results have indicated that IAQ problems existed after the completion of construction. It was found that certain VOC levels were far above the guidelines, and the health hazard symptoms known for these VOCs matched the SBS symptoms found in participants??? health complaints. Interviews with building professionals involved in the project revealed that the lifestyles of the occupants were not seriously considered in the project design. The results of the airflow simulation also revealed problematic aspects of the planning design, exacerbating rather than limiting the pollution problem as intended. The study concludes with a number of recommendations for taking these inter-related aspects of the problem into consideration in future, so that the health of residents is not adversely affected.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sick building syndrome</field><field name="subject">Indoor air pollution</field><field name="subject">Housing and health - Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design automation methodologies for extensible processor platform</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Newton, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses two ubiquitous trends in the embedded system world - the increasing importance of design turnaround time as a design metric, and the move towards closing the design productivity gap. Adopting the right choice of design approach has been recognised as an integral part of the design flow in order to meet desired characteristics such as increasing software content, satisfying the growing complexities of an application, reusing off-the-shelf components, and exploring design metrics tradeoff, which closes the design productivity gap. The importance of design turnaround time is motivated by the intensive competition between manufacturers, especially makers of mainstream electronic consumer products, who shrinks the product life cycle and requires faster time-to-market to maximise economic benefits.  This thesis presents a suite of design automation methodologies to automatically design embedded systems for an application in the state-of-the-art design approach - the extensible processor platform. These design automation methodologies systematise the extensible processor platform???s design flow, with particular emphasis on solving four challenging design problems: i) code segment identification; ii) instruction generation; iii) architectural customisation selection; and iv) processor evaluation.  Our suite of design automation methodologies includes: i) a semi-automatic design system - to design an extensible processor that maximises the application performance while satisfying the area constraint. By specifying a fitting function to identify suitable code segments within an application, a two-level hierarchy selection algorithm is used to first select a predefined processor and then select the right instruction, and a performance estimator is used to estimate an application's performance; ii) a tool to match instructions - to automatically match the pre-designed instructions with computationally intensive code segments, reducing verification time and effort; iii) an instructions estimation model - to estimate the area overhead, latency, power consumption of extensible instructions, exploring larger design space; and iv) an instructions generation tool - to generate new extensible instructions that maximises the speedup while minimising power dissipation. A number of techniques such as system decomposition, combinational equivalence checking and regression analysis etc., have been heavily relied upon in the creation of the final design system. This thesis shows results at every stage to demonstrate the efficacy of our design methodologies in the creation of extensible processors. The methodologies and results presented in this thesis demonstrate that automating the design process for an extensible processor platform results in significant performance increase - on average, an increase of 4.74x (up to 15.71x) compared to the original base processor. Our system achieves significant design turnaround time savings (2.5% of the full simulation time for the entire design space) with majority Pareto points obtained (91% on average), and can lead to fewer and faster design iterations. Our instruction matching tool is 7.3x faster on average compared to the best known approaches to the problem (partial simulations). Our estimation model has a mean absolute error as small as 3.4% (6.7% max.) for area overhead, 5.9% (9.4% max.) for latency, and 4.2% (7.2% max.) for power consumption, compared to estimation through the time consuming synthesis and simulation steps using commercial tools. Finally, the instruction generation tool reduces energy consumption by a further 5.8% on average (up to 17.7%) compared to extensible instructions generated by previous approaches.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">design and construction</field><field name="subject">integrated circuits</field><field name="subject">design automation</field><field name="subject">extensible processor</field><field name="subject">application specific instruction-set processor (ASIP)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bioavailability of folic acid in pectin - coated fortified rice in humans using stable isotope techniques</field><field name="creator">de Ambrosis, Alison, School of Food Science &amp; Technology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rice is an important dietary grain but may be difficult to fortify with water-soluble vitamins due to the losses incurred during processing and preparation. Edible coatings can offer reasonable protection against folate processing losses in fortified rice, in particular pectin (Shrestha, 2003). However, pectin, an indigestible fibre, may entrap or bind added folate, decreasing its absorption efficiency. Healthy volunteers (n=26, 18-39 yrs) received oral 400??g [13C5]PteGlu doses in three separate test meals in randomized cross-over trials as follows: 1) aqueous 2) 200g white rice and 3) 200g of pectin-coated rice premix. A plasma AUC0-8 was conducted (0, 1, 2, 5 and 8 hrs postprandial). Subjects followed a low folate basal diet (112??12 ??g/day) - verified using L.casei microbiological assay - during the AUC and for 24 hours prior. Optimisation of the pectin-coated rice premix gave folic acid coating and cooking losses of 33.5% and 15.5% respectively. The mean test dose error per 400??g folic acid was ?? 26 ??g. Single- or tri- enzyme extraction of fortified rice extracts did not significantly increase the mean assayable folate content compared to the mean folic acid content. The levels of plasma [13C5]5-methyl-THF, [13C5]PteGlu and 5-methyl-THF were quantified using a validated HPLC-tandem MS method. The calibration curves indicated good response linearity in the 0-100 ng/mL range (R2&amp;gt0.9978). Inter- and intra-assay variation of 5-methyl-THF (100 ng/mL) was 6.9% (n=6) and 5.2% (n=4) respectively. The mean recovery of 5, 20 and 50 ng/mL 5-methyl-THF in spiked plasma extracts was 98.6 ?? 8.7%, 89.3 ?? 2.8% and 92.6 ?? 3.7% (n=3) respectively. Standard Reference Material-1846, infant formula (129??28 ??g/100g) was measured at 110 ?? 15 ??g folic acid/100g. The relative bioavailability of the folic acid in meals 2 and 3 was measured by comparing their [13C5]5-methyl-THF AUC???s relative to meal 1. The relative bioavailabilities (Mean % ?? CI) of meals 2 and 3 were 86.5 ?? 4.6 % and 68.7 ?? 5.4 % respectively. It appears the pectin coat moderately reduces short-term folic acid bioavailability. These studies define the basis for calculating the amount of folic acid to be added to rice so that an adequate amount can be absorbed after coating and cooking losses. Pectin coatings may be a useful means of increasing the folate status of populations that rely heavily on rice as a staple.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Folic acid</field><field name="subject">Rice</field><field name="subject">Pectin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an integrated sustainability assessment of the built environment : the convergence of ecological footprint and spatial analysis to map the urban dynamics of a city.</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Arvind, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research examines ways to assess the built environment (BE) for its impacts on the ecosystems and its sustainability in terms of social, economic and environmental aspects on an urban scale. The examination is based on the argument, acknowledged in the literature, that urbanisation is one of the leading causes of unsustainable development, and that the BE makes a significant contribution to this. In order to accomplish this, urban dynamics are identified and mapped with respect to the built environment, and the relationship between urbanisation, the built environment, and the ecosystem is closely examined. The thesis argues that the common denominator in all efforts to move closer to sustainability is an effective assessment method, which not only quantifies the impacts but also informs and educates. The current methods used for assessment of the impacts of BE are found to be inadequate. An appraisal of contemporary assessment methods addressing sustainability and environmental issues at micro (individual building) and macro (urban system) levels is conducted to understand the mechanics of assessment theories. Based on this, a framework for a new assessment system which has the potential to overcome some of the observed weaknesses of the existing ones is proposed. Using multi-criteria analysis principles, this system uses ecological footprint and spatial analysis as its operational engine. It is then applied to a part of the Sydney Central Business District (CBD) for an integrated sustainability assessment. The ecological footprint of the building stock, transport, roads, waste disposal and water supply is calculated as a measure of the environmental impact of the built environment. In addition to this, ???return on investment??? (rental return on construction costs) as a measure of the economic aspect, embodied energy as a measure of material consumption, and ???proximity to facilities??? as a measure of the social benefit of the building stock, are calculated to assess the study area performance on these aspects. These are used to compute an integrated sustainability index for the study area. Various attributes of the built environment, such as total constructed area, height of building, road density etc., are analysed against the ecological footprint to understand the patterns of relationships between urban morphology and the state of sustainability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable development</field><field name="subject">City planning - Environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mythological state and its empire</field><field name="creator">Grant, David John, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">legitimate because it is not the persistence of a secularised theological concept. Although it reoccupied mirror-image pre-Enlightenment questions, say regarding absolutism, it is not first concerned with such categories as ???sovereignty, raison d???etat, will, decision, friend-enemy??? but with ???contract, consent, liberty, law and rights???. However, in Work on Myth, he proposes that man is, and has always been, a maker of mythological magnitudes, of which there can be argued to be an archetypal form. These magnitudes are so fearsome as to allow man to convert his existential fear into fear of an entity the fate of which he can gradually bring into his own hands. In this way, there is the promise of the elimination of existential fear and of the experience of sympathetic conditions of existence. Blumenberg does not address political issues, such as the nature of the State. However, if the State can be shown to be such a magnitude and therefore a political realisation of such an archetype, then it is mythological and so is not modern, even if it is legitimate. It then needs to be criticised to allow the introduction of a radical notion of Enlightenment. The effect of such criticisms would be the replacement of the notions of fear and sympathy with that of self-responsibility as the first interest of the State. Selfresponsibility would need to be promoted progressively. It would require a reconfigured State the prime purpose of which is the promotion of respect and self-reliance of individuals. Its first concern would therefore not be the elimination of fear, which would be understood as unable to be eliminated, nor the creation by it of sympathetic conditions of existence, which would be better a matter for properly prepared and supported, selfreliant individuals. The debate then would be around this axis, where contingency is accepted and managed, not the mythological axis of liberalism and republicanism which has dominated modern political theory since Hobbes. This thesis is first an exploration of the viability of the mythological idea of the State, whether the State is a political realisation of the archetypal myth. It does this through an examination of such thinkers in the political tradition as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Kant, Rawls and Pettit. The conclusion of this examination is, in sum, that the idea of the State since Hobbes has been, and remains, mythological since it shows all the key characteristics of a mythological entity and the arguments for it have mythological presumptions. It is still first concerned with the fear/sympathy nexus and the debates of the political tradition from Hobbes to Pettit have been carried out around that axis. Further, this is argued to be an arrangement which promotes dominant interests rather than widespread participation of non-autonomous, self-responsible individuals. But if this notion of the State as a progressively refined and dispersed mythological entity is viable, it cannot have existed only in the minds of those in the political theoretical tradition. We should expect to see evidence of it in the beliefs and practices of individual  men and women. It must have been not just a political realisation of the mythological State as an idea, but an embodied notion. This thesis is also an exploration of the evidence for that embodiment. It does this by looking at Elias??? analysis of the civilising process in the Middle Ages, at Foucault???s analysis of the emergence and proliferation of the disciplines and the art of government from the 17th century and at the dispersal of the myth through cultural imperialism in the 18th century. The conclusions of these analyses are reinforced by the social ontology of Wittgenstein. Further argument for this embodiment is presented regarding both the common notion of citizenship and the perception of other cultures, that each manifest mythological characteristics. Such embodied practices can be seen as strategies promoted through the State by dominant interests, the purpose of which are the claims to generally eliminate fear and create sympathetic conditions of existence. This embodiment reinforces the initial argument that the idea of the State did emerge and has been established and gradually refined as mythological. In essence and in large part, this is a genealogy of post-Hobbesian political society as mythological. That is, as the political realisation of the archetypal mythological form and its embodiment in the material practice of individuals. The explanatory value of this way of perceiving the State is then demonstrated by its application to the complex conditions of the destruction of traditional Aboriginal culture by the colonising and civilising British, that is the dispersal of the mythological State as empire. From this, it is argued that the mythological understanding of the State is more illuminating that other approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State, The</field><field name="subject">Mythology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The EDD protein is a critical mediator in the DNA damage response</field><field name="creator">Munoz, Marcia, Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">An intact cellular response to DNA damage is important for the maintenance of genomic stability and tumour prevention. EDD, the human orthologue of Drosophila melanogaster ???hyperplastic discs???, is over-expressed or mutated in a number of common human cancers. EDD is a progestin regulated gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell communication and cell adhesion, and although it has also been implicated in the DNA damage response through its association with DNA damage proteins, a definitive role has yet to be demonstrated. The work presented herein shows that EDD is necessary for an adequate cellular response to double-strand DNA breaks. Cells depleted of EDD exhibit reduced survival, radio-resistant DNA synthesis and failure to maintain G2/M arrest following DNA damage induced by phleomycin exposure. Furthermore, EDD-depleted cells display impaired activating phosphorylation and kinase activity of the checkpoint kinase CHK2 after DNA damage. These effects appear to be largely modulated through a phospho-dependent interaction involving the CHK2 FHA domain and a region of EDD spanning a number of putative FHA-binding threonines. These results identify EDD as a novel mediator in DNA damage signal transduction via CHK2 and emphasise the potential importance of EDD in cancer.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">DNA damage checkpoint</field><field name="subject">CHK2</field><field name="subject">EDD</field><field name="subject">Ubiquitin ligase</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">DNA repair</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision-making criteria for software requirements selection: an empirical study in China</field><field name="creator">Hu, Ganglan, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study aims to explore the decision-making criteria for requirements selection in market-driven software development projects in China. Requirements selection decisions are made by reconciling the conflicting stakeholders??? value propositions into a mutually-agreed set through the negotiation and communication process between stakeholders. Firstly, this study identified decision-making criteria according to different stakeholders??? value propositions, and then evaluated the importance of the criteria when making the decisions of requirements selection. Moreover, the study determined the degree to which the stakeholders from business, product, and project perspectives influence the decision-making process. Furthermore, the study explored the communication between major stakeholders in requirements selection process, as a foundation to support and guide the process. A Delphi survey was applied in this study. Opinions from experienced industrial experts were obtained to achieve reliable consensus among them on the criteria and relative importance of the criteria in requirements selection process. The Delphi survey in this study included four phases of data collection by a series of intensive questionnaires interspersed with controlled opinion feedback and follow-up interviews. 132 Experts from 11 companies were recruited by following the rigid procedure to ensure the validity and reliability of the research. The study indicated that criteria from the business perspective had a major influence on decision-making of requirements selection, while project- and product-perspective criteria were relatively lower in priority. However, there were some inconsistencies among the opinions of the recruited experts regarding the importance of the criteria. The inconsistencies may result from a number of different factors, for example; different software development projects; different size, culture, organizational structure or maturity level of the companies; or different working positions of the experts surveyed.  In addition, the study found three different types of communication in requirements selection in the companies surveyed. Further, Chinese culture was believed to have effects on the communication process between stakeholders. While informal communication was highlighted in Chinese context, the Chinese culture of strictly hierarchical communication could lead to problems in the communication process. Further research is recommended to gain deeper insight into these issues.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software - Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Computer software - Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Computer software - Development - Costs - China</field><field name="subject">Multiple criteria decision making</field><field name="subject">Acquisition of computer software</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioinformatic analyses of microarray experiments on genetic control of gene expression level</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Michael, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The advent of microarray technology, allowing measurement of gene expression levels for thousands of genes in parallel, has made possible experiments designed to investigate the genetic control of variation in gene expression level (described in the literature as ???genetical genomics??? or ???eQTL??? experiments). Published results from these studies, in yeast and in mice, show that genetic variation is an important factor in gene regulation, and furthermore that individual polymorphisms modify the expression level of many genes. The concern of this thesis is the bioinformatic analyses of the expression level and genotype data sets that are the raw material for these studies. In particular this thesis addresses the two issues of detection of artefactual effects, and maximizing the information that can be extracted from the data. It is shown that while a polymorphism affecting the expression of many genes may be readily detected, care must be taken to determine whether the detected effect is genuinely one of genetic control of expression level, rather than the effect of correlations in measured expression level not of genetic cause. A significance test is devised to distinguish between these cases. The detection of artefactual correlation is explored further in the reanalysis of the published data from a large yeast study. A critique is given of the permutation method used to ascribe genetic control as the cause of inter gene expression level correlation. The presence of some degree of artefactual correlation is shown, and novel methods are presented for identifying such artefacts. To extend the analyses that may be applied to eQTL data, an algorithm is presented for determining secondary eQTLs for gene expression level (as opposed to a single primary QTL), along with a significance test for the putative QTL found. The technique is demonstrated on a large public data set. In addition to the use for which they are intended, the data sets generated for eQTL studies provide opportunities for additional analyses. In this thesis a method is developed for calculating a genome wide map of meiotic recombination frequency from the genotype data for multiple segregant strains. The method is demonstrated on the published genotype data generated for a large yeast eQTL study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA microarrays gene expression</field><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Providing resilient quality of service connections in provider-based virtual private networks</field><field name="creator">Rosenbaum, Gustav Filip, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on efficient provisioning of resilient Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. It first confirms the intuition that network resources can be more efficiently utilized when resilience mechanisms are implemented by a network provider in the physical network than by its VPN customers in their VPNs. Next, a Multiprotocol Label Switching-based programmable VPN architecture is presented that delivers virtual links as resilient quality of service (QoS) connections and virtual sites. Virtual sites allow customers to implement functionality like customized routing and content adaptation ???in the cloud???, as opposed to the current network model where all functionality is implemented at the network edge. To provision a resilient QoS connection, two paths need to be computed from the ingress to the egress nodes, such that both paths meet the given QoS constraints. Two different frameworks have been proposed in the literature to compute resilient QoS connections when the QoS constraints are bandwidth and end-to-end delay. They both use a preprocessing step whereby either all links with less residual capacity than the given bandwidth constraint are pruned, or the given end-to-end delay is converted to an effective bandwidth. The frameworks thus reduce the problem to one with only a single constraint. We argue in this thesis that these frameworks individually lead to poor network utilization and propose a new framework where both constraints are considered simultaneously. Our framework exploits the dependency between endto- end delay, provisioned bandwidth and chosen path through using the provisioned bandwidth as a variable. Here, two link-disjoint paths are computed together with their respective minimum bandwidths such that both the bandwidth and end-to-end delay constraints are satisfied.  Given our framework we first propose a new generic algorithm that decomposes the problem into subproblems where known algorithms can be applied. Then we propose two new linear programming (LP) formulations that return the two paths and their respective bandwidths such that they have the minimum combined cost. To make our framework applicable in a production environment, we develop two new algorithms with low run times that achieve even higher network performance than their LP formulation counterpart. These algorithms systematically use an algorithm that computes non-resilient QoS connections. As no algorithm for computing nonresilient QoS connections with sufficiently low run time has been proposed in the current literature we develop two new algorithms and their respective heuristics with a run time comparable to Dijkstra???s shortest-path algorithm. Our simulations show that exploiting the dependency between end-to-end delay, provisioned bandwidth and chosen path can significantly improve the network performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extranets (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises - Computer networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The recurrence of rhythm: configurations of the voice in homer, plato and joyce.</field><field name="creator">Martin, William, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Recurrence of Rhythm is an inquiry into the notion that the voice flows ??? a theme that continually recurs in the Homeric poems, Plato's Cratylus and James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses. Through a re-interpretation of the meaning of rhythmos in pre-Socratic philosophy, I define rhythm as the particular manner in which the voice is flowing, and argue that it is the specific quality of phonetic writing to represent the flowing aspect of the voice. The Greek concept of rhythmos is held to be inseparable from the invention of phonetic writing and the transcription of the Homeric poems, and it is this new definition of rhythm that allows the thesis to engage in contemporary debates concerning the relationship between speech and writing (as developed by Derrida, Ong, Havelock, Parry, Lord and Prier). I also argue that the Platonic concept of rhythm qua metre provides an essential point of mediation between the Greek oral tradition and the history of Western literature, a move that sets the scene for a comparative study of Homer and Joyce. By developing an original concept of recurrence that pertains to both the repetition of themes in the Homeric poems and the heroic experience of living for the sake of the story, this thesis proposes that rhythm and recurrence are interrelated concepts that distinguish the lyrical and dramatic modes that structure the epic form of narrative found in both Homer's poems and Joyce's novels. Drawing upon the esthetic philosophy of Stephen Dedalus, I develop the dialectical theory of genre first outlined by Joyce in the Paris notebook, and argue that the latent lyricism contained in the narrative style of A Portrait is a proto-typical form of the interior monologue found in Ulysses. In opposition to the early modernist paradigm of Joyce criticism, this thesis rejects the notion that mythic archetypes function as Platonic ideals (i.e. the transcendent form of the modernist artwork), but rather holds that heroic themes recur in the mental stream of the modern subject, and manifest themselves immediately through Joyce???s use of the interior monologue technique.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhythm</field><field name="subject">Homer</field><field name="subject">Plato</field><field name="subject">Joyce, James, 1882-1941</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and fracture behaviour of graded alumina/epoxy joins</field><field name="creator">Rutgers, Lyndal, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction of a composition gradient at a join between two materials of different elastic properties should reduce the stress concentrating effect of the interfacial discontinuity. A crack oriented perpendicular to this elasticity gradient will experience mode-mixity, and possible subsequent crack deflection. Explicit analytical solutions for the stress state at the tip of an angled crack in a graded material of a given finite geometry do not exist, and ongoing crack path development in such a gradient has not been characterised. An infiltration processing technique is developed which allows two materials to be joined through a region of graded composition, of tailored width and composition profile. Composition discontinuities at layer interfaces in a stepped gradient can be tolerated due to the resulting interpenetrating network structured (INS) microstructure. Firing stresses were found to be a limitation of the processing technique, overcome by limiting the steepness of the elastic gradient. Alumina and epoxy resin graded composites were produced and tested under monotonic loading, resulting in stable crack path evolution. Stress-field asymmetry at the tip of a crack oriented perpendicular to an elastic gradient was demonstrated, followed by subsequent crack deflection. Stress intensity factor and deflection angle increase with increasing gradient steepness. Rising R-curve behaviour was demonstrated for all compositions of the INS composite, with initiation and plateau toughness decreasing with increasing epoxy content. Evidence of crack bridging by intact ligaments of the epoxy phase in the crack wake explains this behaviour. Crack deflection towards the epoxy region was anticipated and demonstrated for all gradient configurations. An increase in relative crack depth was seen to increase mode-mixity at the crack-tip and subsequent crack deflection, up to a relative depth of ~0.5.  No conclusive evidence was found for the influence of crack bridging on crack deflection. Toughness was shown to increase with the inclusion of a microstructural gradient. Measured toughness within graded samples was shown to be controlled by both the local composition and the volume of bridging ligaments in the crack wake. The optimum gradient should ??? extend over the widest region practical, ??? encompass the widest composition range possible, and ??? demonstrate extrinsic crack extension toughening.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adhesive joints</field><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">Aluminium alloys</field><field name="subject">Epoxy compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composite fouling of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate in a dynamic seawater reverse osmosis unit</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yuan, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Deposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) causes serious processing problems and limits the productivity of seawater reverse osmosis (RO) desalination. The interactions between CaSO4 and CaCO3 in the dynamic seawater RO systems have been neglected previously because conventional studies mainly focused on individual compounds or mixed compounds in batch systems. The present work evaluates composite fouling behavior of CaSO4 and CaCO3 in a dynamic RO unit. The fouling experiments were performed at constant pressure and velocity by a partial recycling mode which permeate was withdrawn from the system during the recirculation of retentate to simulate the increasing of water recovery level. The fouling phenomena were monitored by the decline of flux. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a combination of elemental dispersive x-ray microanalysis (EDS), and x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the morphological features, chemical compositions and crystalline phases of foulants. The interactions of CaSO4 and CaCO3 were investigated by the comparison between individual CaSO4 or CaCO3 fouling and composite fouling, and by varying SO42-/HCO3- molar ratio of the feed. A recently developed approach, Scaling Potential Index (SPI) incorporated with measured concentration polarization modulus (CP), for assessing the fouling tendency of inorganic salts on the membrane surface was validated in the dynamic tests. In addition, the effectiveness of two generic scale inhibitors, polyacrylic acid (molecular weight =2100, PA) and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) were evaluated. Some of the highlights of the obtained results are as follows: ??????The precipitation kinetics, morphology and adhesive strength of composite scales were different from pure precipitates ??????CaSO4 precipitated as gypsum while CaCO3 precipitated as two crystalline phases: calcite and aragonite ??????The crystalline phases as well as precipitation kinetics were affected by SO42-/HCO3- ratio ??????Scaling Potential Index was able to predict the fouling tendency of CaSO4 and CaCO3 accurately ??????The dosage of PA and SHMP was effective to mitigate fouling Results of this work are significant, not only because they have made contribution to the fundamental understanding of composite inorganic fouling in RO membrane systems which was ignored previously, but also because they may play a key role in the development of scale control.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calcium sulphate</field><field name="subject">Calcium carbonate</field><field name="subject">Reverse osmosis</field><field name="subject">Saline water conversion</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Olfactory progenitor cell transplantation into the mammalian inner ear</field><field name="creator">Patel, Nirmal Praful, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">A practical consideration in the development of cellular therapy technology for the inner ear is the development of an in vitro model for assessing the optimal conditions for successful application of cells. The first part of this thesis describes the adaptation of the cochleovestibular structure harvested from P1 mouse pups for analysis of factors critical for the optimal implantation of stem cells in the inner ear. Results of these studies establish that the c17.2 neural stem cell line can be introduced into the cochleovestibular structure in vitro. Using this model, c17.2 cells demonstrated survival predominantly within the vestibule and basal spiral ganglion regions. Furthermore, the addition of the ototoxin, cisplatin and the neurotrophin, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Growth Factor (BDNF) enhanced the survival and migration/dispersion of c17.2 cells within the cochleovestibular explant. The second part of this thesis examines the hypothesis that olfactory neurosphere (ONS) and progenitor cells harvested from the olfactory epithelium represent a viable source of graft material for potential therapeutic applications in the inner ear. Olfactory epithelium represents a unique source of pluripotent cells that may serve as either homografts or autografts. The feasibility of ONSs to survive and integrate into a mammalian cochlea in vivo was assessed. The ONSs were isolated as a crude fraction from the olfactory epithelium of P1 to P3 day old swiss webster mouse pups, ubiquitously expressing the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) marker. The ONSs were microinjected into the cochleae of adult CD1 male mice. Four weeks following their implantation, ONS cells expressing the GFP marker and stained by Nestin were identified in all areas of the cochlea and vestibule, including the spiral ganglion. Robust survival and growth of the implanted ONS and ONS derived cells in the cochlea also included the development of ???tumor-like??? clusters, a phenomenon not observed in control animals implanted with c17.2 neural stem cells.

For the first time archaeal isolates were obtained from the pustular and smooth mats, and further characterisation of two strains indicated they might represent novel species of the genus Haloferax. Total DNA was extracted from the mats and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were generated targeting the bacteria, cyanobacteria, archaea and eukarya. Both the pustular and smooth mat bacterial clone libraries were highly diverse, with 11 bacterial divisions represented, and Chao1 estimates of total species richness indicating ~3000 ??? 6000 species. Cyanobacterial and archaeal clone libraries revealed unique phylotypes associated with sediments of differing morphology. Statistically significant differences between the mat populations and Hamelin Pool stromatolite communities were identified using !-LIBSHUFF, a program designed to compare two 16S rRNA gene libraries. Signature lipid biomarkers were assessed for the pustular and smooth mats and an intertidal stromatolite from Hamelin Pool. Fatty acids (as methyl esters), wax esters, hydrocarbons, ether-bound lipids, hopanoids and sterols indicated the presence of oxygenic phototrophs, anoxygenic phototrophs, sulfate-reducing bacteria, sulfur-oxidising bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and archaea in each of the sediment types. Limited contributions from diatoms, bivalves and their dinoflagellate symbionts, and from higher plant aerosols were also detected. Significantly, 2-methyl hopanoids and eight pseudohomologous series of branched alkanes with quaternary carbon centers were identified in the mats and stromatolites. Although differing in lithification status and precise microbial composition, the pustular and smooth mats are excellent analogues for the extant stromatolites of Hamelin Pool, and by corollary, provide a fascinating link to Precambrian microbial communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shark Bay (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of simple physiological growth models to coastal eucalypt regrowth forests in New South Wales.</field><field name="creator">Dore, David William, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences (BEES), UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores issues relating to the application of physiological-process models (???process models???) of forest growth to mixed species, mixed age forests, in particular the coastal blackbutt forests of New South Wales.  Using a dataset provided by State Forests of New South Wales (Carter 1994 unpubl.) a numeric description of the forest was developed and stand-level parameters of interest were derived, in particular the plot by plot stemwood volume growth from 1975 to 1999.  The amounts of harvested volume, volume that died and volume that grew into the measurement population were identified separately, and several different means of accounting for volume change over time were investigated. A method for quantifying the impact of harvesting and other silvicultural practices on the growth of the forest was developed and programs were written to convert the stand-level summary of the harvest impact into a semi-random selection of trees that would be ???harvested??? from the database under the set of silvicultural assumptions (Dore et al. 1999).  A number of process models were investigated and reviewed before selecting one particular model, SUSTAIN (Dewar 1997) for adaption to these forests.  This model is a relatively simple process model with a small number of input parameters.  The model was adapted so that it could be used to compare the SUSTAIN estimate of growth with the growth of an individual stand of trees in the Kendall Forest Management Area, between Wauchope and Taree on the mid-north coast of NSW.  To improve the accuracy of the prediction of growth by SUSTAIN, a method of re-setting the state of the stand to the actual condition at the time of remeasurement was developed.  In addition, the SUSTAIN model was extended to enable two separate levels of canopy to be described and grown separately. Ultimately the model was only partially successful in mirroring the growth predicted by the empirical data.  Its partial success is attributed primarily to the difficulties associated with correctly determining the allocation parameters used by the model to assign net photosynthate to the roots, foliage and stemwood.  The nature of the change in allocation parameters when the forest stand is disturbed by harvest or fire needs further investigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest ecology -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Forest plants -- Australia -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designers and users: a survey of user research methods employed by Australian industrial designers</field><field name="creator">Ward, Stephen James, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Designers of mass produced products require knowledge about anticipated users of their designs in order to make reasonable predictions about how users will interact with a product and how that product will satisfy users??? needs.  However, there is little reported study of how industrial designers get the information they need about users, or to what extent they adapt and use information available from fields of study such as ergonomics or market research.  Study in this area is important, in order to have a knowledge base that will support development of methods and data sources that may help designers and others bring a better understanding of users into the product design process.  In this study, group interviews and a questionnaire were used to ask industrial designers how and where they get information about users, and about their perceptions of the role and value of user research in design.  The group discussions involved a total of 45 participants from nine companies in Sydney.  A questionnaire that followed was completed by 35 respondents representing at least 15 different design consultancy companies throughout Australia.  Results showed that the designers surveyed used many of the methods promoted in the literature of ergonomics, design and market research, but often in a cut-down form.  For example, there was widespread use of work colleagues and family members as test subjects.  Designers used quantitative information where it was applicable but often sought qualitative information that would provide insights or enable them to develop empathic understanding of the users.  Time and cost constraints limited the extent to which designers could engage in user research activity but there was general agreement that user research was a necessary part of design and that in the future designers will require a stronger capability in user research.  Further research could focus on the evaluation of user research methods used in design and the potential for further collaboration between designers and other specialists in this area.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human engineering</field><field name="subject">Industrial design -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doped quantum antiferromagnets</field><field name="creator">L??scher, Andreas, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we study the effects of doping in two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets. We consider cases where the undoped parent compound is a Mott insulator with long-range antiferromagnetic order and focus on the low-doping situations.  The limit of localized impurities is studied in a system consisting of a host magnet and two additional weakly coupled spins. We derive the effective Hamiltonian describing the interaction between these impurities as a function of their distance and show that it exhibits xyz anisotropy, leading to NMR and EPR line broadening. We calculate the  magnetization disturbance in the host magnet induced by a single impurity and find that it always enhances Neel order.  Relaxing the localization constraint, we investigate the single-hole dynamics of the t-J model on the honeycomb lattice. Using exact diagonalizations, series expansion and the self-consistent Born approximation, we calculate the quasi-particle dispersion, bandwidth and residues and compare our findings with the well-established results for the square lattice. Similar to the latter case, we find an almost flat band along the edges of the magnetic Brillouin zone and well-defined hole pockets around the corners.  The most important part of this thesis is devoted to the magnetic properties of lightly doped La2-xSrxCuO4, the simplest and by far most studied cuprate superconductor. Starting from the undoped parent compound, we calculate the spin-wave spectrum and the spin-flop transitions in a uniform magnetic field at zero temperature. We then consider the low-doping regime and derive the effective field theory describing the spin dynamics in insulating La2-xSrxCuO4, x &#8804; 0.055, at low temperature. The spin structure resulting from the spiral solution of the extended t-J model, obtained by taking into account the Coulomb trapping of holes by Sr ions, is confined in the copper-oxide planes. Our solution explains why the incommensurate structure is directed along the orthorhombic b axis and allows us to calculate the positions and shapes of the neutron scattering peaks numerically. These results are in perfect agreement with experimental data. We also show that topological defects (spin vortex-antivortex pairs) are an intrinsic property of the spin-glass ground state.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Copper oxide superconductors.</field><field name="subject">High temperature superconductivity.</field><field name="subject">Antiferromagnetism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topic-focused and summarized web information retrieval</field><field name="creator">Yoo, Seung Yeol, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the Web is getting bigger and bigger with a rapidly increasing number of heterogeneous Web pages, Web users often suffer from two problems:  P1) irrelevant information and  P2) information overload  Irrelevant information indicates the weak relevance between the retrieved information and a user's information need. Information overload indicates that the retrieved information may contain 1) redundant information (e.g., common information between two retrieved Web pages) or 2) too much amount of information which cannot be easily understood by a user.  We consider four major causes of those two problems P1) and P2) as follows;  ??? Firstly, ambiguous query-terms.  ??? Secondly, ambiguous terms in a Web page.  ??? Thirdly, a query and a Web page cannot be semantically matched, because of the first and second causes.  ??? Fourthly, the whole content of a Web page is a coarse context-boundary to measure the similarity between the Web page and a query.  To answer those two problems P1) and P2), we consider that the meanings of words in a Web page and a query are primitive hints for understanding the related semantics of the Web page. Thus, in this dissertation, we developed three cooperative technologies: Word Sense Based Web Information Retrieval (WSBWIR), Subjective Segment Importance Model (SSIM) and Topic Focused Web Page Summarization (TFWPS).  ??? WSBWIR allows for a user to 1) describe their information needs at senselevel and 2) provides one way for users to conceptually explore information existing within Web pages.  ??? SSIM discovers a semantic structure of a Web page. A semantic structure respects not only Web page authors logical presentation structures but also a user specific topic interests on the Web pages at query time.  ??? TFWPS dynamically generates extractive summaries respecting a user's topic interests.  WSBWIR, SSIM and TFWPS technologies are implemented and experimented through several case-studies, classification and clustering tasks. Our experiments demonstrated that 1) the comparable effectiveness of exploration of Web pages using word senses, and 2) the segments partitioned by SSIM and summaries generated by TFWPS can provide more topically coherent features for classification and clustering purposes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Topic-focus</field><field name="subject">Summarization</field><field name="subject">Web Information Retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scenario House</field><field name="creator">Wise, Gianni Ian, Media Arts, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Scenario House, a gallery based installation, is comprised of a room constructed as a ???family room??? within a domestic space, a television with a looped video work and a sound componant played through a 5.1 sound system. The paper is intended to give my work context in relation to the processes leading up to its completion.  This is achieved through clarification of the basis for the installation including previous socio-political discourses within my art practice. It then focuses on ways that the installation Scenario House is based on gun practice facilities such as the Valhalla Shooting Club. Further it gives an explanation of the actual production, in context with other art practices.  It was found that distinctions between ???war as a game??? and the actual event are being lost within ???simulation revenge scenarios??? where the borders distinguishing gaming violence, television violence and revenge scenarios are increasingly indefinable. War can then be viewed a spectacle where the actual event is lost in a simplified simulation. Scenario House as installation allows audience immersion through sound spatialisation and physical devices. Sound is achieved by design of a 5.1 system played through a domestic home theatre system. The physical design incorporates the dual aspect of a gun shooting club and a lounge room. Further a film loop is shown on the television monitor as part of the domestic space ??? it is non-narrative and semi-documentary in style. The film loop represents the mediation of the representation of fear where there is an exclusion of ???the other??? from the social body.  When considering this installation it is important to note that politics and art need not be considered as representing two separate and permanent realities. Conversely there is a need to distance politicised art production from any direct political campaign work in so far as the notion of a campaign constitutes a fixed and inflexible space for intellectual and cultural production. Finally this paper expresses the need to maintain a critical openness to media cultures that dominate political discourse. Art practices such as those of Martha Rosler, Haacke and Paul McCarthy are presented as effective strategies for this form of production.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Terrorism in art.</field><field name="subject">Fear in art.</field><field name="subject">Mass media and art.</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art)</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art) -- 21st century -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Art, Modern -- 20th century -- Political aspects.</field><field name="subject">Art, Modern -- 21st century -- Political aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-time power system disturbance identification and its mitigation using an enhanced least squares algorithm</field><field name="creator">Manmek, Thip, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes, analyses and implements a fast and accurate real-time power system disturbances identification method based on an enhanced linear least squares algorithm for mitigation and monitoring of various power quality problems such as current harmonics, grid unbalances and voltage dips. The enhanced algorithm imposes less real-time computational burden on processing the system and is thus called ???efficient least squares algorithm???. The proposed efficient least squares algorithm does not require matrix inversion operation and contains only real numbers. The number of required real-time matrix multiplications is also reduced in the proposed method by pre-performing some of the matrix multiplications to form a constant matrix. The proposed efficient least squares algorithm extracts instantaneous sine and cosine terms of the fundamental and harmonic components by simply multiplying a set of sampled input data by the pre-calculated constant matrix. A power signal processing system based on the proposed efficient least squares algorithm is presented in this thesis. This power signal processing system derives various power system quantities that are used for real-time monitoring and disturbance mitigation. These power system quantities include constituent components, symmetrical components and various power measurements. The properties of the proposed power signal processing system was studied using modelling and practical implementation in a digital signal processor. These studies demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of extracting time varying power system quantities quickly and accurately. The dynamic response time of the proposed method was less than half that of a fundamental cycle. Moreover, the proposed method showed less sensitivity to noise pollution and small variations in fundamental frequency. The performance of the proposed power signal processing system was compared to that of the popular DFT/FFT methods using computer simulations. The simulation results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed method under both transient and steady-state conditions. In order to investigate the practicability of the method, the proposed power signal processing system was applied to two real-life disturbance mitigation applications namely, an active power filter (APF) and a distribution synchronous static compensator (D-STATCOM). The validity and performance of the proposed signal processing system in both disturbance mitigations applications were investigated by simulation and experimental studies.  The extensive modelling and experimental studies confirmed that the proposed signal processing system can be used for practical real-time applications which require fast disturbance identification such as mitigation control and power quality monitoring of power systems</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Power system disturbance identification</field><field name="subject">Least squares algorithm</field><field name="subject">Electric power system stability</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Quality control</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Protection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on reading strategies in KSL class</field><field name="creator">Sim, Sang Min, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent years, KSL (Korean as a second language) education has developed together with the rising status of Korea in the international community. In the context of KSL, the number of foreign students has increased dramatically by virtue of Korea??s growing status. Most learn the Korean language for academic purposes and successful reading is an important key to success in their academic setting.  The purpose of this study is to examine the types of reading strategies employed by intermediate KSL learners when reading Korean texts. The study also attempted to examine similarities and differences in the use of reading strategies according to the variables of gender, nationality, text genre, and reading proficiency and to investigate the results of data analysis by multiple research methods, namely, reading strategies questionnaires/follow up interviews, think aloud protocols, and diary studies.  The results of the study indicated that the participants employed all of the defined reading strategies. In particular, participants concentrated on dealing with cognitive strategies and support strategies. Furthermore, most participants employed ??focusing word?? strategy frequently owing to the effect of orthographic similarity. In addition, some participants used multiple reading strategies simultaneously rather than a particular single strategy to cope with a breakdown in comprehension. This study found no meaningful overall differences in strategy use according to the variables of gender, nationality, and text genre. However, skilful readers employed every reading strategy actively compared with less skilful readers with regard to the variable of proficiency. There were some discrepancies of results among multiple research methods. These differences are due to the characteristics of each research method. This finding suggested that in fact the multiple research methods serve to complement each other. Implications are discussed in relation to the significance of multiple research methods as well as the construction of KSL reading strategy training programs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reading.</field><field name="subject">Second language acquisition -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Korean language.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vernacular, regional and modern- Lewis Mumford???s bay region style and the architecture of William Wurster</field><field name="creator">Castle, Jane, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines aspects of the work of American writer and social critic, Lewis Mumford, and the domestic buildings of architect William Wurster. It reveals parallels in their careers, particularly evident in an Arts and Crafts influence and the regional emphasis both men combined with an otherwise overtly Modernist outlook. Several chapters are devoted to the background of, and influences on, Mumford???s regionalism and Wurster???s architecture. Mumford, a spiritual descendent of John Ruskin, admired Wurster???s work for its reflection of his own regionalist ideas, which are traced to Arts and Crafts figures Patrick Geddes, William Morris, William Lethaby and Ruskin. These figures are important to this study, firstly because the influence of their philosophical perspective allowed Mumford, almost uniquely, to position himself as a spokesman for both Romanticism and Modernism with equal validity, and secondly because of their influence upon early Californian architects such as Bernard Maybeck, and subsequently upon Wurster and his colleagues. Throughout the thesis, an important architectural distinction is highlighted between regional Modernism and the International Style. This distinction polarised the American architectural community after Mumford published an article in 1947 suggesting that the ???Bay Region Style??? represented a regionally appropriate alternative to the abstract formulas of International Style architecture and nominated Wurster as its most significant representative. Wurster???s regional Modernism was distinct from the bulk of American Modernism because of its regional influences and its indebtedness to vernacular forms, apparent in buildings such as his Gregory Farmhouse. In 1948, Henry-Russel Hitchcock organised a symposium at New York???s Museum of Modern Art to refute Mumford???s article. Its participants acrimoniously rejected a regionalist alternative to the International Style, and architectural historians have suggested that authentic regional development in the Bay Region largely ceased because of such adverse theoretical and academic scrutiny. After examining the influences on Mumford and Wurster, the thesis concludes that twentieth century regional architectural development in the San Francisco Bay Region has influenced subsequent Western domestic architecture. Wurster suggested that architects should employ the regional and vernacular rather than emulate historical styles or follow theoretical models in their buildings and Mumford, upon whose work Critical Regionalism was later founded, is central to any understanding of the importance of the vernacular, regional and historical in modern architecture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wurster, William Wilson</field><field name="subject">Architecture, Modern -- United States</field><field name="subject">Architecture, Domestic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geometry-based stochastic physical channel modeling for cellular environments</field><field name="creator">Simsim, Mohammed Talal, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Telecommunication has experienced significant changes over the past few years and its paradigm has moved from wired to wireless communications. The wireless channel constitutes the basic physical link between the transmitter and the receiver antennas. Therefore, complete knowledge of the wireless channel and radio propagation environment is necessary in order to design efficient wireless communication systems. This PhD thesis is devoted to studying the spatial and temporal statistics of the wireless channel in cellular environments based on a geometry-based stochastic physical channel modeling approach. Contributions in this thesis report include the following: ??? A new physical channel model called the eccentro-scattering model is proposed to study the spatial and temporal statistics of the multipath signals in cellular environments. ??? Generic closed-form formulas for the probability density function (pdf) of angle of arrival (AoA) and time of arrival (ToA) of the multipath signals in each cellular environment are derived. These formulas can be helpful for the design and evaluation of modern communication systems. ??? A new Gaussian scattering model is proposed, which consists of two Gaussian functions for the distribution of scatterers around base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) and confines these scatterers within a scattering disc. ??? The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal statistics of the multipath signals in cellular environments is discussed. Three motion scenarios are considered for the possible trajectory of the mobile unit. Furthermore, two different cases are identified when the terrain and clutter of mobile surrounding have additional effect on the temporal spread of the multipath signals during motion. ??? The physical channel model is employed to assess the performance of a RAKE receiver in cellular environments. ??? Comparisons between uniform scattering and Gaussian scattering, which are the two assumptions for the distribution of scatterers usually used in the derivation of the pdf of AoA, are also presented. ??? An overview of earlier physical channel models and comparisons between these models and with the proposed model are presented.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Cellular telephone systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of injury risks associated with wearing the enhanced combat helmet and night vision goggle - driver: frontal vehicle collision study</field><field name="creator">Nakaza, Edward Takeshi, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The requirement to operate vehicles in low light and/or night environments whilst wearing night vision goggle (NVG) systems has become increasingly common during military operations.  There is very limited research investigating injury risks associated with these systems during ground vehicle collisions. This study examined the injury risks associated with wearing the Australian Defence Force - Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) and NVG system, in frontal vehicle collisions.  This project consisted of two components: (1) crash tests using a sled and (2) numerical simulations of impacts.  Four dynamic sled tests were conducted using a 50th percentile, male, Hybrid III dummy positioned on a rigid seat. Frontal impact tests were performed at a 40 km/h change in velocity (*v) and 20 g deceleration. The test configurations were as follows: (a) Base; (no helmet or additional equipment); (b) ECH; and, (c) ECH and NVG. Condition (c) was carried out twice, to determine repeatability. The sled test protocols were reconstructed precisely with the numerical simulation package MADYMO and the simulations were shown to correlate well with the experimental results. Using this validated model, four parametric studies were undertaken to assess the influence of counterweights, seat cushion, seatbelt pre-tensioner, and the vehicle's *v and acceleration on injury risks.  The study found that neck loads were within acceptable limits, with the exception of the neck extension moment, which was exceeded for all NVG conditions. Based on the parametric studies, no major improvements were observed in the neck extension moments with the use of counterweights or a seat cushion. In contrast the use of a seatbelt pre-tensioner was observed to decrease greatly this neck injury risk in certain scenarios. The study also identified that a *v of 15 km/h and peak acceleration of up to 14 g were required to keep the neck extension moment below the prescribed injury criteria. However, the high neck extension moment values may have been partially attributable to the stiff Hybrid III neck.  This study identified a possible injury mechanism for soldiers using the ECH and NVG system during specific impact scenarios. The method applied in this project was designed to be repeatable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Night vision goggle.</field><field name="subject">NVG.</field><field name="subject">Enhanced Combat Helmet.</field><field name="subject">ECH.</field><field name="subject">Whiplash.</field><field name="subject">Frontal collision.</field><field name="subject">Traffic accident investigation.</field><field name="subject">Night vision devices.</field><field name="subject">Helmets -- Testing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and numerical modelling of wave-induced current and wave transformation in presence of submerged breakwaters</field><field name="creator">Tajziehchi, Mojtaba, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two dimensional experimental and numerical modeling of wave transmission and wave-induced current over detached submerged breakwaters has been carried out in this thesis.  Two preliminary 3D and a comprehensive series of 2D laboratory experiments have been conducted in the wave basin and 3 m wide wave flume. The preliminary 3D experimental tests qualitatively investigated the flow behavior behind a submerged breakwater and confirmed the validity of the 2D tests. The 2D laboratory tests examined wave breaking, reflection, transmission as well as wave-induced set-up and currents over submerged breakwater/reef structures.  Different approaches to experimental data processing are examined in producing reliable application of the 2D laboratory measurements. Sensitivity of wave transmission coefficient, wave-induced set-up and wave-induced discharge over submerged breakwaters to other dimensional and non-dimensional parameters are comprehensively investigated. Previously published analytical/experimental studies for predicting/calculating wave breaking, wave transmission, wave-induced set-up and current are discussed and compared with the present experimental results. Improved equations/models are presented.  Numerical modeling of the hydrodynamic effects of wave breaking and flow over a submerged breakwater is investigated using Delft3D. The capability of the Delft3D numerical model to simulate wave height transformation and wave-induced current over submerged breakwaters is provided. Four different approaches using combinations/options within the two main modules of Delft3D (SWAN and FLOW) are tested in the numerical simulations and the results are compared to the laboratory experimental data.

Stanislavski, Meyerhold, Piscator, Brecht, Grotowski, and more recently Peter Brook are only a few of the figures who tried to engage spectators and enable them to participate more fully in the play. Yet in Iran there has existed for over three centuries a form of theatre which, thanks to its unique method of approaching reality, creates precise moments in which the worlds of the actor and the spectator come together in perfect unity. It is called ???taziyeh???, and the aim of this thesis is to offer a comprehensive account of this complex and sophisticated theatre. The thesis examines taziyeh through the accounts of eyewitnesses, and explores taziyeh???s method of acting, its form, concepts, the aims of each performance, its sources and origins, and the evolution of this Iranian phenomenon from its emergence in the tenth century. Developed from the philosophical point of view of Iranian mysticism on the one hand, and annual mourning ceremonies with ancient roots on the other, taziyeh has been performed by hundreds of different professional groups for more than three hundred years. Each performance is a significant event in the experience of actors and spectators. The thesis argues that through a careful and comprehensive exploration of taziyeh from its emergence to our time, we can ultimately experience a new horizon in theatre in which we may discover theatrical potentiality and dynamism in a way that has not yet been achieved in conventional Western theatre.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ta'ziyah -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Theater -- Iran</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of an altered intrauterine environment on the offspring???s renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems</field><field name="creator">O???Connell, Amanda Elizabeth, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the effects of an altered intrauterine environment on the offspring???s renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems. After a midgestational asphyxial episode in fetal sheep (30 min total umbilical cord occlusion at 90 days; term 150 days) the hydrops that resulted had not completely resolved by 130 days. While the heart and kidneys were apparently unaffected, the brain and lung weights were 37% and 50% lower than sham values, respectively and there were joint contractures. The effects of maternal renal disease on the offspring were investigated. Although in utero fetuses of subtotally nephrectomised ewes (STNx) had altered urine flow rates, sodium excretion, haematocrits, plasma chloride and plasma renin levels, by 1-2 weeks after birth these values in the lambs (STNxL) were similar to controls (ConL) under baseline conditions. Body weight and the weights of most organs were similar, including the kidney, in which glomerular number was normal. In the neonatal period, the lambs were subjected to four challenges: furosemide (2 mg/kg intravenous bolus), infusion of angiotensin II and phenylephrine, intravenous infusion of 0.15M saline (50 ml/kg over 30 min) and haemorrhage (20% estimated blood volume over 10 min). These challenges revealed evidence of programming of several aspects of the renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems in the STNx offspring. As young adults at 6 months of age, male and female offspring of STNx ewes were normotensive and had normal renal function. On a high salt diet (HSD, 0.17M NaCl in 8L water for 5-7days), female offspring of both groups did not become hypertensive. However, the STNx offspring must have retained salt and water as plasma sodium was increased and haematocrit was decreased. In the STNx offspring only, there was a relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and mean arterial pressure, indicating an inability to maintain a constant GFR in response to changes in arterial pressure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neonatology</field><field name="subject">Fetus - Physiology</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">Renin-angiotensin system</field><field name="subject">Kidneys</field><field name="subject">Sheep- Embryos</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of debt relief in low-income countries</field><field name="creator">Elnasri, Amani, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The perceived lack of conclusive quantitative evidence on the macroeconomic effects of debt relief in low-income countries has generally blurred the image of debt relief efforts and left the issues of its effectiveness and efficiency open to debate and dispute. This thesis seeks to shed more light on the subject by providing some further empirical evidence. This objective is achieved by performing an empirical investigation of two effects of debt relief. First, the study examines the debt relief-new borrowing relationship in a multivariable regression framework. The results that emerge suggest that, on average, debt relief can be beneficial in reducing the future new borrowing of Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). This conclusion, to some extent, is in line with the goals of HIPCs debt relief initiatives in reducing external debt burdens of those countries to sustainable levels. However, it presents a challenge to the views of William Easterly on the ???perverse incentive effects??? of ???continuing waves??? of debt relief that are said to lead to further debt accumulation of a similar magnitude to replace old cancelled debt. Second, the analysis explores the influence of debt relief on domestic investment behaviour in developing countries. Debt relief is found to have a positive effect on domestic investment in countries with good policy environments. This result suggests that debt relief would be more effective in promoting domestic investment if it were more cautiously conditioned on sound policy frameworks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Debt relief -- Developing countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whose values shape social policy?:  policy process limits to economic rationalism:  Australian coordinated care policy 1994 to 2001.</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Karen Raewyn, Social Policy Research Centre, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a significant gap in Australian social policy literature about the relationship between the impact of economic rationalism on social policy and interest representation during policy implementation. Michael Pusey, for instance, argues that economic rationalism displaces social values in social policy. However, other theorists, such as Robert Alford and Rod Rhodes, caution that policy often changes when it is implemented. With a foundation in Weberian social theory about participant values, the analytical framework incorporates three institutional policy implementation concepts to capture the dynamic characteristics of the policy process. These are: policy stages to describe policy change over time; structural interests of policy organisations; and policy networks within which participants act. The thesis tests this framework to explain the impact of values of economic rationality in the Australian coordinated care policy. The policy attempted to coordinate the care of people with chronic care needs, using a funds pool, case managers and care plans. The research methods are interviews with policy participants; analysis of public documents; and participant observation as an evaluator in one trial. Data about the policy process from 1994 to 2001 are analysed with a critical interpretive approach. The study reveals that central agency officials acted primarily on values of economic rationality. In contrast, health agency officials acted primarily on organisational values. The transfer of responsibility for the policy process from a central agency to the health agency after the policy statements reinforced health provider organisational interests, rather than either the rationalist interests of central agencies or the social interests of consumer groups. The policy consequently changed away from economic rationality. The policy process in the planning, implementation and revision stages was in no sense an instrumental application of the values of economic rationality apparent in the policy statements stage. Neither, however, did social values predominate in any policy stage.  The study argues that insights from policy implementation research can refine the literature on economic rationalism. This research further advances policy network theory. It recognises that understanding which organisation is responsible for the policy, at various policy stages, advances our understanding of whose values shape social policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social policy -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Economic policy -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust solutions for constraint satisfaction and optimisation under uncertainty.</field><field name="creator">Hebrard, Emmanuel, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">We develop a framework for finding robust solutions of constraint programs. Our approach is based on the notion of fault tolerance. We formalise this concept within constraint programming, extend it in several dimensions and introduce some algorithms to find robust solutions efficiently.  When applying constraint programming to real world problems we often face uncertainty. Whilst reactive methods merely deal with the consequences of an unexpected change, taking a more proactive approach may guarantee a certain level of robustness. We propose to apply the fault tolerance framework, introduced in [Ginsberg 98], to constraint programming: A robust solution is one such that a small perturbation only requires a small response. We identify, define and classify a number of abstract problems related to stability within constraint satisfaction or optimisation. We propose some efficient and effective algorithms for solving these problems. We then extend this framework by allowing the repairs and perturbations themselves to be constrained. Finally, we assess the practicality of this framework on constraint satisfaction and scheduling problems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Logic programming.</field><field name="subject">Constraint programming.</field><field name="subject">Fault-tolerance computing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation and improvement of the design of scarf repairs to aircraft</field><field name="creator">Harman, Alex Bruce, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Flush repairs to military aircraft are expected to become more prevalent as more thick skin composites are used, particularly on the surface of the fuselage, wings and other external surfaces. The use of these repairs, whilst difficult to manufacture provide an aerodynamic, ???stealthy??? finish that is also more structurally efficient than overlap repairs. This research was undertaken to improve the design methodology of scarf repairs with reduced material removal and to investigate the damage tolerance of scarf repair to low velocity impact damage. Scarf repairs involve shallow bevel angles to ensure the shear stress in the adhesive does not exceed allowable strength. This is important when repairing structures that need to withstand hot and humid conditions, when the adhesive properties degrade. Therefore, considerable amounts of parent material must be machined away prior to repair. The tips of the repair patch and the parent laminate are very sharp, thus a scarf repair is susceptible to accidental damage. The original contributions include: ???	Developed analytic means of predicting the stresses within optimised scarf joints with dissimilar materials. New equations were developed and solved using numerical algorithms. ???	Verified using finite element modelling that a scarfed insert with dissimilar modulus subjected to uniaxial loading attracted the same amount of load as an insert without a scarf. As such, the simple analytic formula used to predict load attraction/diversion through a plate with an insert may be used to predict the load attraction/diversion into a scarf repair that contains a dissimilar adherend patch. ???	Developed a more efficient flush joint with a doubler insert placed near the mid line of the parent structure material. This joint configuration has a lower load eccentricity than external doubler joint. ???	Investigated the damage tolerance of scarf joints, with and without the external doubler. The results showed that scarf joints without external doublers exhibited a considerable strength reduction following low velocity impact. Based on the observations, the major damage mechanics in the scarf joint region following impact have been identified. These results demonstrated that it is important to incorporate damage tolerance in the design of scarf repairs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airplanes -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Composite materials -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Airplanes -- Fuselage -- Maintenance and repair.</field><field name="subject">Joints (Engineering).</field><field name="subject">Finite element method.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of initial microstructure on the deformation and annealing behaviour of low carbon steel.</field><field name="creator">Xu, Wanqiang, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effect of initial microstructures of an 0.05 wt.% C low carbon steel, acicular ferrite (AF), Bainite (B), polygonal ferrite (PF), fine polygonal ferrite (FPF), and a microstructure produced by direct strip casting (DSC) (termed SC),  on the deformation and recrystallization behaviour of cold rolled low carbon (LC) steel, was investigated.  The initially prepared samples with the initial microstructures were cold rolled to 50, 70 and 90% reductions, then annealed isothermally in the temperature range 580 ??? 680 oC.  The microstructures and textures produced by deformation and annealing were studied by optical microscopy, XRD, TEM, SEM and EBSD. The initial microstructures were characterized mainly by optical microscopy and EBSD.  Using EBSD, the ferrite grain size of the AF, B and SC samples was considerably larger than that found by optical microscopy with a large fraction of low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) observed within prior austenite grains.  All samples exhibited a very weak texture close to random.  After cold rolling, the microstructures of AF and SC contained shear bands with PF and FPF generating deformation bands.  For AF and SC, the pearlite phase was more extensively elongated in rolling direction compared with PF and FPF.  After 90% cold rolling reduction, PF, FPF and SC consist mainly of the   texture component and AF and B  .  It was found that FPF recrystallized most rapidly followed by B, PF and AF with SC recrystallizing orders of magnitude more slowly due to the solution drag caused by its uniformly distributed higher Mn content.  Very strong   (???-fibre) texture was generated in cold rolled PF followed by FPF, with AF, SC and B generating very weak textures.  The texture evolution during annealing 90% reduction PF was examined in further detail.

However, silica fouling is the recovery limiting factor in RO system. Silica chemistry is complex and its degree of fouling strongly depends on the silica solubility and its polymerization under different operating conditions of RO process. In several studies carried out in batch and dynamic tests, the presence of polyvalent cations and supersaturation of silica in solutions were found to be the important factors (apart from pH and temperature) that affected the rate of silica polymerization and its induction period. Agitation did increased silica solubility; however, its effect was negligible in presence of polyvalent cations. Alkalization of water solution by coagulants particularly sodium hydroxide was found suitable for silica removal during pretreatment. The presence of magnesium in solution played a key role in silica removal mostly by the mechanism of adsorption to the metal hydroxide. The options of inline mixing (high agitation) for 5 to 10 minutes and microfiltration before RO were found suitable for silica pretreatment. During dynamic tests, the most dominant mechanism for salt deposition (mostly CaSO4) was particulate type in high concentration water solution; while crystallization fouling was the prevailing mechanism of deposition (mostly CaCO3 and silica) in low concentration solution. Silica showed significant effect on size and shape of inorganic salt crystals during coprecipitation. Moreover, the presence of common antiscalants promoted silica fouling. This important finding recommends an extra caution while using antiscalants in case feed water contains silica to a level that can attain saturation near membrane during RO process. A model was developed to predict the silica fouling index (SFI) based on the experimental data for induction period of silica polymerization. The model takes into account the effect of polyvalent cations and concentration polarization near membrane during RO process. It provides a conservative basis for predicting the maximum silica deposition in RO process at the normal operating conditions. A generalised correlation, which was developed for determination of the mass transfer coefficient in RO process, incorporated the effect of temperature change that is usually not considered in previous correlations. A correlation for reduction of silica content in feed water, down to a safe limit of 15 ppm for RO process, was also formulated and validated by the experimental results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silica fouling.</field><field name="subject">Silica polymerization.</field><field name="subject">Desalination.</field><field name="subject">Membranes.</field><field name="subject">Pretreatment.</field><field name="subject">Saline water conversion -- Reverse osmosis process.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40882</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular regulation of Megakaryopoiesis: the role of Fli-1 and IFI16</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Lacey Nicole, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Megakaryocytes (Mks) are unique bone marrow cells, which produce platelets. Dysregulated Mk development can lead to abnormal platelet number and the production of functionally defective platelets, causing bleeding, thrombotic events, and leukaemia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving megakaryopoiesis may yield insights into the molecular genetics and cellular pathophysiology of a diversity of disorders. The primary aim of this thesis was to gain insight into the molecular events required for normal Mk development. As transcription factors and cytokines play a central role in driving Mk development, both of these processes were investigated. Fli-1 and GATA-1 are key transcription factors regulating Mk-gene expression, alone and co-operatively. To understand the mechanism of transcriptional synergy exerted by Fli-1 and GATA-1, in vitro assays were carried out investigating the interactions between Fli-1, GATA-1 and DNA that mediate synergy. A novel mechanism of synergy was identified, where Fli-1 DNA binding is not required, although an interaction between Fli-1 and GATA-1, and GATA-1 DNA binding is required. Importantly, the results demonstrate that Fli-1 DNA binding is not essential for promoting Mk-gene expression in primary murine bone marrow cells. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary cytokine responsible for Mk and platelet development. Identifying novel TPO gene-targets may provide invaluable information to aid the understanding of the complex and unique processes required for Mk development. Using microarray technology, IFI16 was identified as a TPO-responsive gene that has not previously been studied in the Mk lineage. This work demonstrated that IFI16 is expressed in CD34+ HSC-derived Mks, and that the Jak/STAT pathway is essential for the activation of IFI16 by both TPO and IFN-??. Of biological significance, IFI16 was found to regulate both the proliferation and differentiation of primary Mks, suggesting that IFI16 may control the balance between these two essential processes. In conclusion, the data in this thesis presents a novel mechanism through which Fli-1 and GATA-1 regulate the synergistic activation of Mk genes. The identification and functional characterisation of a novel TPO-inducible gene, IFI16, involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of Mks is also described. These findings have implications for several congenital and malignant conditions affecting Mk and platelet development, and possibly a mechanism for IFN-induced thrombocytopaenia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Megakaryocytes</field><field name="subject">Fli-1</field><field name="subject">GATA-1</field><field name="subject">IFI16</field><field name="subject">Thrombopoietin</field><field name="subject">Interferon</field><field name="subject">Blood cells</field><field name="subject">Blood platelets</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professionalisation of Australian catholic social welfare, 1920-1985</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Damian John, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the neglected history of Australian Catholic social welfare, focusing on the period, 1920-85. Central to this study is a comparative analysis of diocesan welfare bureaux (Centacare), especially the Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide agencies. Starting with the origins of professional welfare at local levels, this thesis shows the growth in Catholic welfare services across Australia. The significant transition from voluntary to professional Catholic welfare in Australia is a key theme. Lay trained women inspired the transformation in the church???s welfare services. Prepared predominantly by their American training, these women devoted their lives to fostering social work in the Church and within the broader community. The women demonstrated vision and tenacity in introducing new policies and practices across the disparate and unco-ordinated Australian Catholic welfare sector. Their determination challenged the status quo, especially the church???s preference for institutionalisation of children, though they packaged their reforms with compassion and pragmatism. Trained social workers offered specialised guidance though such efforts were often not appreciated before the 1960s. New approaches to welfare and the co-ordination of services attracted varying degrees of resistance and opposition from traditional Catholic charity providers: religious orders and the voluntary-based St Vincent de Paul Society (SVdP). For much of the period under review diocesan bureaux experienced close scrutiny from their ordinaries (bishops), regular financial difficulties, and competition from other church-based charities for status and funding. Following the lead of lay women, clerics such as Bishop Algy Thomas, Monsignor Frank McCosker and Fr Peter Phibbs (Sydney); Bishop Eric Perkins (Melbourne), Frs Terry Holland and Luke Roberts (Adelaide), consolidated Catholic social welfare. For four decades an unprecedented Sydney-Melbourne partnership between McCosker and Perkins had a major impact on Catholic social policy, through peak bodies such as the National Catholic Welfare Committee and its successor the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission. The intersection between church and state is examined in terms of welfare policies and state aid for service delivery. Peak bodies secured state aid for the church???s welfare agencies, which, given insufficient church funding proved crucial by the mid 1980s.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church charities -- Australia -- Catholic Church -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Social service -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Social workers -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Volunteer workers in social service -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Professions -- Social aspects -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">James Brown: apprehending a minor temporality.</field><field name="creator">Scannell, John, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with popular music's working of time. It takes the experience of time as crucial to the negotiation of social, political or, more simply, existential, conditions. The key example analysed is the funk style invented by legendary musician James Brown. I argue that James Brown's funk might be understood as an apprehension of a minor temporality or the musical expression of a particular form of negotiation of time by a minor culture. Precursors to this idea are found in the literature of the stream of consciousness style and, more significantly for this thesis, in the work of philosopher Gilles Deleuze on the cinema in his books Cinema 1: The Movement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image. These examples are all concerned with the indeterminate unfolding of lived time and where the reality of temporal indeterminacy will take precedence over the more linear conventions of traditional narrative. Deleuze???s Cinema books account for such a shift in emphasis from the narrative depiction of movement through time the movement-image to a more direct experience of the temporal the time-image, and I will trace a similar shift in the history of popular music. For Deleuze, the change in the relation of images to time is catalysed by the intolerable events of World War II. In this thesis, the evolution of funk will be seen to reflect the existential change experienced by a generation of African-Americans in the wake of the civil-rights movement. The funk groove associated with the music of James Brown is discussed as an aesthetic strategy that responds to the existential conditions that grew out of the often perceived failure of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Funk provided an aesthetic strategy that allowed for the constitution of a minor temporality, involving a series of temporal negotiations that eschew more hegemonic, common sense, compositions of time and space. This has implications for the understanding of much of the popular music that has followed funk. I argue that the understanding of the emergence of funk, and of the contemporary electronic dance music styles which followed, would be enhanced by taking this ontological consideration of the experiential time of minorities into account. I will argue that funk and the electronic dance musics that followed might be seen as articulations of minority expression, where the time-image style of their musical compositions reflect the post-soul eschewing of a narratively driven, common sense view of historical time.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Funk (Music) -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Soul music -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">African American aesthetics.</field><field name="subject">Time in music.</field><field name="subject">Soul musicians -- United States.</field><field name="subject">Funk musicians -- United States.</field><field name="subject">African Americans in popular culture.</field><field name="subject">Music -- Philosophy and aesthetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysts' forecasts and future stock return volatility: a firm-level analysis for NYSE Firms</field><field name="creator">Shan, Yaowen, School of Banking &amp; finance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study demonstrates that financial analysts significantly affect short-term stock prices, by examining how non-accounting information particularly contained in analysts' forecasts contributes to the fluctuation of future stock returns.

In this work, the suitability of Mo and Mo-W carbides has been investigated as a possible cost-effective alternative to noble metals in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The molybdenum and tungsten monometallic and bimetallic carbides were prepared through precipitation from homogeneous solution to the sulphide followed by carburization with a mixture of propane and hydrogen to produce the resulting metal carbide. A 23 factorial design strategy was employed to investigate the effect of three carburizing variables, namely, time, temperature and gas ratio on the resulting catalyst. In particular, the effect of supports was also examined through four common semiconductor oxide supports, namely: Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2. Thermogravimetric analysis of the carburization reactions showed that the conversion from metal sulphide to the metal carbides is a multistep process producing different phases of carbides, namely ??-MoC1-x, ??-Mo2C, ?? -WC1-x and ??-W2C, depending on heating rate and temperature. The rate determining step of the carburising reaction is the diffusion of carbon atoms into the metal matrix, hence giving relatively low activation energy values. Statistical analysis of the factorial design revealed that all three carburizing variables affect the final physiochemical makeup of the catalyst. SEM analysis showed that the carbides are well dispersed on the surface of the support and catalyst particles produced are nanoparticles in the range of 25 to 220 nm depending on the support. Fischer-Tropsch activity test showed that monometallic molybdenum carbide is active under Fischer-Tropsch conditions while tungsten carbide is inactive for the conditions studied in this project. However, bimetallic carbide catalyst, consisting of the two mentioned metals gave overall higher reaction rates and decreased methane selectivity. Steady state analysis revealed that there are two active sites on the surface of molybdenum carbide catalyst resulting in two chain growth propagation values when analysed via the Anderson-Schulz-Flory kinetics. Overall, ZrO2 support appeared to be the most suitable support followed by SiO2, TiO2 and Al2O3. Finally, kinetic modelling of data showed that methanation and higher hydrocarbons formation path occurs via combination of the oxygenated intermediate and Eley-Rideal mechanism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fischer-Tropsch process</field><field name="subject">Catalysts -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Carbides</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of ???environmental refugee??? protection at the United Nations</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Karen Elizabeth, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to better conceptualise how and why there is an absence of international protection for ???environmental refugees???, and to place these findings in the critical geopolitics literature. A poststructuralist framework, drawing on Foucault???s ideas of discourse, subjectivity, power and governance, was deemed most appropriate for this thesis, and provided a means of differentiation from previous literature on ???environmental refugees???. This thesis develops a genealogy of the subject category of ???environmental refugees??? since the 1970s, to better understand how the United Nations, Inter-Governmental Organisations (IGOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the media have constructed environmental issues and refugees in texts. Fieldwork undertaken in 2004 enabled me to conduct 45 semistructured interviews with United Nations diplomats and representatives from IGOs and NGOs. Critical scrutiny of these interview texts revealed the constructions of ???environmental refugees??? as various subject identities, particularly in relation to climate change. Pacific ambassadors to the United Nations were also interviewed in 2004 to explore how they negotiated discourses on climate change and ???environmental refugees???, and attempted to articulate their concerns at the United Nations. This thesis contends that an absence of policy at the United Nations to protect ???environmental refugees??? has been produced by a combination of discursive and institutional politics. Unequal power structures at the United Nations have limited the capacity of small island states to lobby and articulate concerns, while subject categories of ???environmental refugees??? have been constructed in ways that alter the terms of debate, evade legal response, or deflect blame away from the perpetrators of environmental damage. Reasons for this policy absence have been the shifting attitudes towards environmental issues and the role of multilateral political institutions. The overall contribution of this thesis is to critical geopolitics, through its examination of the role of multilateralism, representations of environmental issues causing population displacement, and how and why policy absences are created within multilateral institutions such as the United Nations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugees -- Protection</field><field name="subject">Refugees -- International cooperation</field><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="subject">Internally displaced persons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into audience perception of Mononoke Hime: construction and reconstruction of contemporary Japanese identity</field><field name="creator">Suparman, Michie Akahane, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This exploratory study follows existing theory and analysis of mass media product and its audience analysis.

Academic research has increasingly shed light on audience members??? socialisation by utilising mass media products in encompassing academic fields such as media studies, communication studies and cultural studies. It is widely agreed that the content of mass media products play a significant role in their socialisation. This study takes up a Japanese anime, Mononoke Hime as a sample case for investigating audience members??? socialization. Through the analysis of reactions of audience members to Mononoke Hime, it will be investigated how audience members interpret the anime reflecting one???s experience in the society relating the experience to the content of Mononoke Hime. It will be clarified that the audience members of the anime construct and reconstruct their sense of self, morals and values in the society, that is, they utilize the anime as a facility for their socialization. The data of this study are collected comments which are compiled in a published magazine and private comments posted on Internet sites. 133 comments in the magazine and 32 comments on Internet sites are selected for the analysis. The data were analysed by two analytical approaches. The first analysis is to see how the consulted viewers established their relationship with the anime, while the second analysis is to see how the viewers depicted and interpreted the content of the anime. This study concluded that the consulted audience members show high level of ideological involvement with the anime; they depict parts of the anime relating to their experience in the real life and talk the anime seriously rather than playfully enjoy it as an entertainment. By analysing the comments of consulted audience members, it is also revealed that the audience members take characters of the anime as a role model both in cross gender and gender based ways.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language</field><field name="subject">Animated films -- Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immune regulation in mouse models of allergic asthma</field><field name="creator">Su, Yung-Chang, University of New South Wales &amp; Garvan Institute of Medical Research. St. Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Allergic asthma is an immunological disease, mediated by CD4+ Th2 cells, and its prevalence has increased over recent decades. Features of allergic asthma include airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway eosinophilia, excessive airway mucus production, and increased IgE and Th2 cytokine levels. Airway remodeling with pulmonary fibrosis is noted in the progress of asthma. In this thesis, a murine model of allergic asthma was used to investigate the effect of cyclophosphamide (CY) on asthma and the involvement of regulatory T cells (Treg), and the role of Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) in allergic asthma by using GM-CSF knockout mice. CY is a cytotoxic agent, which paradoxically augments several immune responses. The first part of this thesis was aimed to study the effects of CY in a murine model of allergic airway inflammation. BALB/c mice were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) on days 0 and 14, and challenged with aerosolized OVA from days 21 to 27. Some mice additionally received CY on days -2 and 12. In the CY-treated animals, pronounced worsening of inflammatory features was noted, including increases in eosinophil infiltration, epithelial thickness, mucus occlusion and eosinophil numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Increased total and OVA-specific serum IgE were also noted in the CY-treated animals. In cell cultures from peritracheal lymph nodes, the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 were elevated in animals treated with CY. It was hypothesized that the effects of CY could be caused by reduced immunosuppression mediated by Treg. mRNA expression of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta was reduced in the lungs of CY-treated mice. The expression of FoxP3, a marker of naturally occurring Treg, was significantly reduced in spleens, thymuses and peritracheal lymph nodes after the second injection of CY, and in the lung tissue after allergen challenge in CY-treated mice. Furthermore, lung IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells and CTLA-4+-bearing CD4+ T cells were reduced after allergen aerosol challenge in CY-treated mice. Thus CY worsened the features of allergic pulmonary inflammation in this model, in association with increased production of IgE and Th2 cytokines. The reduction in expression of FoxP3 and immunosuppressive cytokines by CY suggests that toxicity to Treg may contribute to the increased inflammation. GM-CSF plays a role in the growth, development, and maturation of bone marrow hemopoietic cells into mature blood cells, and has been proposed to be involved in potentiating the function of inflammatory cells in allergic inflammation. In the second part of this thesis, GM-CSF knockout (KO) mice were used to investigate the role of GM-CSF. In allergic KO mice, airway eosinophils were only shown in the perivascular, but not peribronchial areas in the lung, compared to the allergic wild-type (WT) mice in which eosinophil infiltration appeared in both areas. Eosinophil numbers were drastically reduced in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of KO mice. IL-5 production in the lung tissue and BALF in allergic KO mice was reduced; similar results were also found in peritracheal draining lymph nodes after in vitro stimulation assays. However, IL-4 and IL-13 production, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and serum IgE production were not affected in allergic KO mice. Surprisingly, lung IFN-gamma mRNA and BALF levels were increased in allergic KO mice. Lung mRNA levels of CCR3, a key chemokine receptor on eosinophils, were significantly reduced in allergic KO mice, whereas expression of the chemokines eotaxin and RANTES were at similar levels in allergic KO and WT mice. Lung mRNA levels of the IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines Mig (CXCL9) and IP-10 (CXCL10), which are antagonists of CCR3, and their receptor CXCR3 were increased in allergic KO mice, compared with allergic WT mice. Data obtained from flow cytometry showed more eosinophils survived in the lung of WT mice than KO mice. Another allergy model, a peritoneal allergy model was performed to investigate inflammation in a different model. Leukocyte subpopulations such as neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes were reduced in the peritoneal lavage fluid of allergic KO mice. The findings revealed that GM-CSF is essential for IL-5 production, pulmonary airway eosinophilia and eosinophil survival. In the absence of GM-CSF, over-production of IFN-???? may induce chemokines, including Mig and IP-10, which are antagonists for CCR3 and may reduce airway eosinophil infiltration. In this thesis, a murine model of allergic asthma has been used to obtain novel findings on the regulation of allergic inflammation. The results with CY are relevant to the treatment of asthma patients with CY and other cytotoxic agents. The findings in the GM-CSF KO mice suggest that GM-CSF is a potential therapeutic target in asthma, and that in assessment of new therapeutic agents for asthma, effects on GM-CSF should be considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">eosinophil</field><field name="subject">IgE</field><field name="subject">cyclophosphamide</field><field name="subject">IL-4</field><field name="subject">IL-5</field><field name="subject">IL-10</field><field name="subject">TGF-beta</field><field name="subject">regulatory T cell</field><field name="subject">GM-CSF</field><field name="subject">chemokine</field><field name="subject">CCR3</field><field name="subject">eotaxin</field><field name="subject">RANTES</field><field name="subject">IP-10</field><field name="subject">Mig</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Method of analysing the risk of injury in young female gymnasts due to repetitive loading and fatigue</field><field name="creator">Beatty, Karen Tania, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The majority of gymnasts are young girls. Training hours required to meet competition demands are high and gymnasts begin serious training at a young age. Concerns regarding injury risk are substantial and may be the result of repeated high impact loads experienced during landings from dismounts, tumbling and vaulting. There is currently little information available to coaches regarding the quantity of training that is safe or not safe. The use of acceleration was tested for its efficacy for use in the field to examine risk factors for injury. Risk factors examined were loading and fatigue. Kinematics, ground reaction forces and acceleration were measured during landing from gymnastics skills and also pre- and post fatigue during landing from a vertical jump and a 35cm drop in the laboratory.  A pilot study was performed in the field to examine accelerations during gymnastics skills pre- and post-training.  Lower body kinematics of landing were notably different between gymnastics skills analysed. Joint positions at touchdown and range of motion available during landing due to these joint positions affect the ability to contribute to energy absorption. Peak ground reaction forces and peak accelerations measured at the pelvis showed significant differences between skills landing on both the hands and the feet. The peak acceleration during landing from gymnastics skills was positively correlated with the peak ground reaction force. A large variability stiffness during landing meant that an estimation of ground reaction force using simple modelling was not successful in improving the correlation. After a fatiguing jumping and landing task peak accelerations measured at the pelvis during landing were increased indicating the use of acceleration for identifying fatigue. Pilot field testing of acceleration during landing from gymnastics skills showed similar results to laboratory results. Pre- and post-training measurements showed no difference in peak accelerations during landing from the skills analysed. The training session completed was not demanding enough to induce enough fatigue to be seen in acceleration values Acceleration has potential to be used to quantify repeated loading and accumulative effects in gymnastics, as well as the presence of fatigue in gymnasts during training sessions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gymnastics.</field><field name="subject">Injury.</field><field name="subject">Repetitive loading.</field><field name="subject">Fatigue.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The supramolecular chemistry of cucurbituril molecules</field><field name="creator">Lorenzo, Susan, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The set of molecules cucurbit[n]uril (Qn) are macrocycles composed of n glycoluril monomers linked by methylene groups. These molecules have two oxygen-ringed portals of a diameter slightly smaller than their internal cavity diameter. This thesis describes syntheses, crystallisations, crystal structure determinations, crystal packing analyses and force field calculations exploring the supramolecular chemistry of Qn molecules and their derivatives. Qn acts as a host for guest molecules and at the outset of this project no metal containing molecule had been encapsulated in a Qn molecule. One aim of this project was to prepare such complexes. This was achieved with the synthesis and characterisation of crystalline {[cis-SnCl4(H2O)2]@Q7}2(SnCl6)3(H3O)6(H2O)23. Other compounds prepared and characterised crystallographically in the course of this project are: [(Q6)(Na3(H2O)8)]2[CoCl4]4[Co(H2O)6]2[CoCl(H2O)5]2(Cl)4, (Q5@Q10)(CH3COOH)(Cl)2(H3O)2(H2O)26, (Cl@Q5)4Q6(SnCl6)8(H3O)20(H2O)24, (Q8)3(PtCl6)4(H3O)8(H2O)x, (Q8)2(PtCl6)3(H3O)6(H2O)18, (Q7)(Cr3O10)(H3O)2(H2O)x and (Q6)(SnCl6)(H3O)2(H2O)x. While the smaller Qn (n = 5?) retain their circular forms, the larger Qn (n &amp;gt 8) are less rigid and distort to accommodate larger guests. After analysis of the crystal structures of these Qn compounds and those listed in the Cambridge Structural Database, the principal packing motifs of the Qn molecules were elucidated. The most common is the portal-to-side interaction in which the portal oxygen atoms of one Qn approach the hydrogen atoms around the equator of another Qn. Force-field calculations on guest@Qn complexes were conducted to determine the mechanism for the formation of these complexes. A comparison of the intermolecular interactions of phenylated systems and comparable fluorinated phenyl systems was made using both crystal packing analyses and forcefield energy calculations. Intermolecular energy parameters for these calculations were derived and validated in this work. The principal fluorinated species studied was the [B(C6F5)4]?anion. Examination of its crystal structures found that the substitution of the hydrogen atoms by fluorine atoms is influential enough to alter the predominant  intramolecular conformation. It is the ???flipper?conformer, between pairs of perfluorophenyl groups, that is overwhelmingly the favoured conformation and this has a strong effect on the types of phenyl embraces that a [B(C6F5)4]?anion will form. While the parallel 4PFE, the offset parallel 4PFE and the orthogonal 4PFE are all observed the 6PFE is not.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supramolecular chemistry</field><field name="subject">Macrocyclic compounds</field><field name="subject">Chemistry, Analytic -- Technique</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of aldosterone in myocardial remodelling</field><field name="creator">Kotlyar, Eugene, St Vincents Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The pathophysiology of cardiac failure involves activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system that contributes to adverse left ventricular remodelling. This is a complex pathologic process that has been shown to be stimulated by haemodynamic and humoral factors including aldosterone. The precise mechanisms by which aldosterone contributes to this process are not known. In a mouse animal model of pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy and failure, the treatment with selective mineralocorticoid receptor, eplerenone, was shown to attenuate adverse left ventricular remodelling. This was associated with decreases in myocardial apoptosis, collagen turnover, oxidative stress and inflammation, in the absence of a significant blood pressure change. Furthermore, we administered aldosterone infusion and high salt diet to uninephrectomised mice deficient in the gp91phox subunit of NADPH oxidase and to the wild type strain. It was demonstrated that the increase in the blood pressure did not occur in the gp91phox deficient mice and that both wild-type and knock-out strains developed cardiac hypertrophy, but not interstitial fibrosis. Additionally, patients with chronic stable heart failure were also studied. We found that plasma aldosterone level was independently associated with levels of markers for oxidative stress (of 8- isoprostaglandin F2??), inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and matrix turnover (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1). High plasma osteopontin levels were also noted. Our experiments suggest that myocardial apoptosis, collagen turnover, oxidative stress and inflammation may be involved in mediating the adverse effects of mineralocorticoid receptor activation in pressure overload. In addition, the development of cardiac hypertrophy may be a haemodynamically independent process, but gp91phox subunit deficiency did not attenuate the hypertrophic response to aldosterone infusion when administered in conjunction with high salt diet, suggesting that there may be another mechanism that mediates aldosterone-induced hypertrophy. The state of increased oxidative stress and inflammation, seen in animal models, may also play an important role in chronic heart failure subjects. The importance of local factors in the regulation of myocardial tissue remodelling has become increasingly evident, but future investigations are required to clarify the role of aldosterone, oxidative stress and inflammation in heart failure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aldosterone</field><field name="subject">Myocardium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microfabrication technology for an integrated monolithic electromagnetic microactuator based on polymer bonded permanent magnet.</field><field name="creator">Rojanapornpun, Olarn, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Electromagnetic microactuators with permanent magnets have many potential applications such as micro-energy scavengers, microswitches, micromirrors and microfluidics. However, many electromagnetic microactuator designs utilize either external permanent magnet or external coil, which do not allow tight integration to other MEMS components and further miniaturization. Furthermore, all of the available permanent magnet microfabrication technologies have some drawbacks and improvements are required. Thus the integrated monolithic electromagnetic microactuator is investigated in this project. The three main components of the electromagnetic actuator have been investigated separately. A novel microfabrication technology called ???Template printing???for the fabrication of polymer bonded permanent magnet has been investigated and developed. It is based on ???Screen printing??? which has its drawbacks on alignment accuracy and poor line definition. This is eliminated in ???Template printing??? by photolithography of the photoresist template. The shape and location of the permanent magnet is defined by the template. A new approach based on the filling of dry magnetic powder and vacuum impregnation has been developed to form the polymer bonded permanent magnet. This allows the use of short pot-life matrix material and the elimination of homogenous mixing. A monolithic electromagnetic microactuator has been fabricated successfully. It consists of a 2-layer planar copper microcoil, surface micromachined polyimide beam and Strontium ferrite/EPOFIX permanent magnet (diameter of 460 ??m and 30 ??m thickness). Large deflection in excess of 100 ??m at 35 mA driving current and magnetic force of 0.39 ??N/mA have been achieved. It compares favourably with other much larger electromagnetic actuators that have been reported. ???Template printing??? has the potential of being a low temperature batch process for the microfabrication of thick polymer bonded permanent magnets with high magnetic properties and low residual stress. The fabrication consistency and the quality of template printed magnet can be improved in future studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microactuators -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Microfabrication.</field><field name="subject">Permanent magnets -- Industrial applications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Media Politics : how is the media agenda of Chinese television set by the state, market, and civil society?</field><field name="creator">Li, Nan, School of Social Science &amp; International Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">How is the media agenda of Chinese television set by the three institutional powers, the state, market and civil society? How do formal and informal institutions of the state, market and civil society in contemporary China set the media agenda with specific rules and organizations? And what are the power relations among the three institutions that shape the structure and functionaries of mass media in general? Based on a new theoretical framework of media agenda-setting for the analysis of media politics in contemporary China, these questions are explored in three sections.  First, policies and regulations had been established by formal and informal institutions of the state to safeguard the state agenda as the primary media agenda. The second, market set audience rating and commercial income as major rules for Chinese television to survive in a competitive economy. The third, emerging civil society set moral standards for television broadcasters to produce programs to check the failure of the state and market on one hand, and to serve the needs and rights of audience as-citizens on the other. The constant changing power relations between the state and market, or between the state and civil society are also explored in sections that market and civil society interact respectively with the state to set the media agenda. The first finding of this thesis relates to the nature of contemporary Chinese television. As one servant for three masters, Chinese television is a mixed entity, which can be motivated to be a state agent, a market entity, and sometimes, a civil society player as well. In long term, Chinese television can be expected to be differentiated and reorganized as affiliates to the three institutions respectively along with the gradual establishment of a checks-and-balances system within and between the state, market, and civil society. The second finding concerns power relations among the three institutions. While both market and civil society emerged to be more and more dynamic in motivating the media to accommodate new social agendas, the state remains as the primary power in setting the media agenda of Chinese television.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Politics and culture -- China.</field><field name="subject">Meida and public affairs -- China.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Encapsulation of Si:P devices fabricated by scanning tunnelling microscopy</field><field name="creator">Goh, Kuan Eng Johnson, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates the effective use of low temperature molecular beam epitaxy to encapsulate planar Si:P (phosphorus-in-silicon) devices lithographically patterned by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) without significant redistribution of the dopants. To achieve this goal, low temperature magnetotransport is used in combination with STM, Auger electron spectroscopy and secondary ion-mass spectrometry to analyse Si:P ??-doped samples fabricated under different doping and growth conditions. An important aspect of this project is the use of large 1 ?? 1 cm2 Si(001) samples which are about five times larger than standard STM samples. The larger sample size is necessary for post-STM fabrication lithography processes in a cleanroom but presents problems for preparing atomically clean surfaces. The ability to prepare clean and atomically flat Si(001) surfaces for STM lithography on such 1 ?? 1 cm2 samples is demonstrated, and it is shown that Si:P ??-doped layers fabricated on these surfaces exhibit complete electrical activation. Two dopant sources (gaseous PH3 and solid GaP source) were investigated to assess their compatibility with STM-lithography on the H:Si(001) surface. The findings show that while the PH3 and GaP sources result in near identical electrical qualities, only PH3 molecules are compatible with H-resist based lithography for controlled nano-scale doping. For achieving complete activation of the P dopants, it is shown that an anneal to ??? 350 ???C to incorporate P atoms into the Si surface prior to encapsulation is critical. While it is known that the presence of H during growth degrades the quality of Si epitaxy, investigations in this thesis indicate that it has no significant effect on dopant activation. Systematic studies performed to assess the impact of growth temperature recommend an encapsulation temperature of 250 ???C for achieving optimal electrical qualities with minimal dopant segregation. In addition, it is shown that rapid thermal anneals (RTAs) at temperatures &amp;lt 700 ???C provide only marginal improvement in the electrical quality of Si:P ??-doped samples encapsulated at 250 ???C, while RTA temperatures &amp;gt 700 ???C should be avoided due to the high probability of dopant redistribution. To elucidate the nature of 2D transport in Si:P ??-doped devices, a detailed analysis of the low temperature magnetotransport for Si:P ??-doped layers with doping densities in the range ??? 0.2 ??? 2 ?? 1014 cm???2 was carried out. Using conventional 2D theories for disordered systems, both weak localisation (WL) and electron-electron interactions (EEI) are shown to contribute almost equal corrections to the 2D conductivity. In particular, it is found that EEI can introduce a significant correction in the Hall coefficient RH (hence Hall density) especially in the low density/temperature regime and the need to correct for this when using the Hall density to estimate the activated electron density is highlighted. While the electronic mean free path in such highly doped ??-layers is typically &amp;lt 10 nm making ballistic transport in these devices difficult to observe, the phase coherence length can extend to almost 200 nm at about 0.3???0.5 K for doping densities of ??? 1 ??? 2 ?? 1014 cm???2. Finally, the optimised encapsulation strategy developed in this thesis is applied to a 2D square device fabricated by STM. The device exhibits Ohmic conductivity  with complete dopant activation. An analysis of its low temperature magnetotransport shows that the device behaves similarly to a Si:P ??-doped layer encapsulated under similar conditions, thus highlighting that the STM patterning process had no adverse effect on device quality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor doping</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Scanning tunneling microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Market probability density functions and investor risk aversion for the australia-us dollar exchange rate.</field><field name="creator">Forrester, David Edward, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis models the Australian-US Dollar (AUD/USD) exchange rate with particular attention being paid to investor risk aversion. Accounting for investor risk aversion in AUD/USD exchange rate modelling is novel, so too is the method used to measure risk aversion in this thesis. Investor risk aversion is measured using a technique developed in Bliss and Panigirtzoglou (2004), which makes use of Probability Density Functions (PDFs) extracted from option markets. More conventional approaches use forward-market pricing or Uncovered Interest Parity. Several methods of estimating PDFs from option and spot markets are examined, with the estimations from currency spot-markets representing an original application of an arbitrage technique developed in Stutzer (1996) to the AUD/USD exchange rate. The option and spot-market PDFs are compared using their first four moments and if estimated judiciously, the spot-market PDFs are found to have similar shapes to the option-market PDFs. So in the absence of an AUD/USD exchange rate options market, spot-market PDFs can act as a reasonable substitute for option-market PDFs for the purpose of examining market sentiment.  The Relative Risk Aversion (RRA) attached to the AUD/USD, the US Dollar-Japanese Yen, the US Dollar-Swiss Franc and the US-Canadian Dollar exchange rates is measured using the Bliss and Panigirtzoglou (2004) technique. Amongst these exchange rates, only the AUD/USD exchange rate demonstrates a significant level of investor RRA and only over a weekly forecast horizon. The Bliss and Panigirtzoglou (2004) technique is also used to approximate a time-varying risk premium for the AUD/USD exchange rate. This risk premium is added to the cointegrating vectors of fixed-price and asset monetary models of the AUD/USD exchange rate. An index of Australia???s export commodity prices is also added. The out-of-sample forecasting ability of these cointegrating vectors is tested relative to a random walk using an error-correction framework. While adding the time-varying risk premium improves this forecasting ability, adding export commodity prices does so by more. Further, including both the time-varying risk premium and export commodity prices in the cointegrating vectors reduces their forecasting ability. So the time-varying risk premium is important for AUD/USD exchange rate modelling, but not as important as export commodity prices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign exchange -- Econometric models -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Foreign exchange market</field><field name="subject">Capitalists and financiers -- Attitudes -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Exchange rates -- Econometric models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The educational leader as counsellor implications for selection, appraisal and professional development for school leaders</field><field name="creator">Yeung, Nancy Tsui Yee, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examined the literature on leadership and counselling to determine their similarities, and investigated how principals perceived their leadership role in terms of the theories of counselling and contemporary leadership. It further explored the implications of the findings for the selection, performance appraisal and professional development of principals. The research was divided into four stages. Firstly, the literature of effective counsellors and educational leaders was reviewed to find their significant similarities. Secondly, 116 principals from Government and Catholic primary, secondary and special schools in Sydney, NSW, Australia were involved in a Q-sort survey to prioritise what they deemed to be the essential emphases of effective educational leaders in schools. Analysis was by descriptive quantitative methods to provide a basis for subsequent interviews and qualitative analysis. Thirdly, structured interviews were carried out with thirteen of these principals to cast further light on the Q-sort survey results. Qualitative analysis was largely based on Bohm???s interpretation of Strauss???s axial coding paradigm. Fourthly, content analysis was carried out on formal documents of the NSW Department of School Education and the Catholic School System of the Sydney Diocese to determine the degree of congruence between selection criteria, criteria for performance appraisal and components of professional development programs for principals and the emphases in the literature and the responses of principals in this study. Contemporary literature on both leadership and counselling emphasised the importance of the leader???s/counsellor???s authenticity, empathy, respect, and effective communication skills. Principals prioritised these counselling-related attributes after a focus on students and strategic leadership but ahead of organisation, resource management, evaluating and controlling. Some ranking differences by gender, years of experience, type of school and school system were noted and discussed. Document analysis revealed that the criteria by which principals are selected, appraised and professionally developed do not include an emphasis on the counselling-related attributes which is commensurate with the importance afforded these attributes both in contemporary leadership theory and from the principals??? own view of their role. Implications of these findings for theory, practice and further research were explored and recorded.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Educational counseling</field><field name="subject">School principals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the consequences for students of using different procedures to equate tests as fit to the Rasch model degenerates</field><field name="creator">Sadeghi, Rassoul, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many large-scale national and international testing programs use the Rasch model to govern the construction of measurement scales that can be used to monitor standards of performance and monitor performance over time. A significant issue that arises in such programs is that once a decision has been made to use the model, it is not possible to reverse the decision if the data do not fit the model. There are two levels of question that result from such a situation. One of them involves the issue of misfit to the model. That is, how robust is the model to violations of fit of the data to the model? A second question emerges from the premise that the issue of fit to the model is a relative matter. That is, ultimately, it becomes the decision of users as to whether data fit the model well enough to suit the purpose of the users. Once this decision has been made, such as in the case of large-scale testing programs like the ones refocused to above, then the question reverts to one in which the focus is on the applications of the Rasch model. More specifically, in the case of this study, the intention is to examine the consequences of variability of fit to the Rasch model on the measures of student performance obtained from two different equating procedures.  Two related simulation studies have been conducted to compare the results obtained from using two different equating procedures (namely separate and concurrent equating) with the Rasch Simple Logistic model, as data-model fit gets progressively worse. The results indicate that when data-model fit ranges from good fit to average fit (MNSQ ??? 1.60), there is little or no difference between the results obtained from the different equating procedures. However, when data-model fit ranges from relatively poor fit to poor fit (MNSQ &amp;gt 1.60), the results from using different equating procedures prove less comparable. When the results of these two simulation studies are translated to a situation in Australia, for example, where different states use different equating procedures to generate a single comparable score and then these scores are used to compare performances amongst students and to predetermined standards or benchmarks, it raises significant equity issues. In essence, it means that in the latter situation, some students are deemed to be either above or below the standards purely as a consequence of the equating procedure selected. For example, students could be deemed to be above a benchmark if separate equating was used to produce the scale; yet these same students could be deemed to fall below the benchmark if concurrent equating is used. The actual consequences of this decision will vary from situation to situation. For example, if the same equating procedure was used each year to equate the data to form a single scale, then it could be argued that it does not matter if the results vary from occasion to occasion because it is consistent for the cohort of students from  year to year. However, if other states or countries, for example, use a different equating procedure and the results are compared, then there is an equity problem.

According to his political speeches, this construct proposes a 'dangerous', 'corrupt' and 'undemocratic' recent past that necessitated his 'Revolutionary' present; a 'revolutionary' present that strives to create the preconditions for a 'prosperous' future Greece; and a future Greece that shall embody the 'Helleno-Christian' ideals of the distant past, and detach itself from the failings of the recent past.  The premise on which the research is founded is that patterns in his political speeches can be quantitatively identified and that, from these patterns, a qualitative interpretation can be developed. Thus, quantitative data were collated concerning the frequency of key terms and concepts, both literal and figurative, in all of Papadopoulos's political speeches and, then, cross-referenced with audience composition and date of delivery. These data were subsequently analysed holistically in the context of the political, social, economic and cultural aspects of Greece's recent history.  The thesis developed from the data is divided into three parts. The first part examines the history immediately before and during the 7-year dictatorship. The second and third parts consider specific lexical terms and concepts and medical and biological analogies, respectively, in Papadopoulos's political speeches. Some examples examined in the lexicon component are Revolution, distant past, communism, security. Some examples analysed in the medical and biological component are doctor, infection, cells and the plaster cast.  Clear correlation can be discerned between certain lexical and figurative preferences and audience composition and/or time of delivery; however, while clear lexical and figurative transitions and shifts are noted over the 6-year period, his underlying cyclical narrative is consistently present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papadopoulos, Ge&#333;rgios, 1919-</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organ donation and anti-littering campaigns: a comparative study of Australia and Singapore</field><field name="creator">Lee, Bee Eng Adeline, Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current literature on public communication campaigns suggests that challenges and problems remain, even though generally the effectiveness of campaigns has increased in the past years. Challenges and problems are issue-specific and efforts put into influencing particular social behaviours through public communication campaigns have not been significantly successful. Although public communication campaigns are a popular method employed to influence social behaviours in many societies, campaign strategies inadequately consider the impact of cultural elements on social behaviours. The disappointing results through the use of campaigns are exacerbated by the difficulties faced in translating research observations to appropriate campaign strategies.  In view of current challenges, this research examines public communication campaigns. Two main variables shaped this research ??? ???identity??? and ???culture???. The research postulated that a person???s identity influences his or her behaviour. It also argued that culture would impact on behaviour. The theoretical orientation drew on interpretivist perspectives. Using a comparative cross-cultural method, this research nominated the issues of organ donation and waste disposal behaviours in public places and the countries of Australia and Singapore for empirical study. Focus group research was employed. A total of sixteen focus groups were conducted ??? eight groups on organ donation (four in Sydney, Australia and four in Singapore) and eight groups on waste disposal behaviours (four in Sydney, Australia and four in Singapore). In line with the theoretical orientation, ???grounded theory??? was used to analyse the focus group transcripts.  It is argued that a person???s decision to organ donation or waste disposal behaviour was intimately related to his or her identity. Cultural elements are critical constituents of identity. This is to say, cultural values, beliefs and attitudes have significant impact on social behaviours. These intricacies were made apparent when each issue was seen in the national contexts of Australia and Singapore. This research concludes that issues of identity can partly explain the type of decision a person makes about organ donation, and the kind of waste disposal behaviour a person enacts. It also argues that the effectiveness of campaign strategies can potentially be enhanced, if the strategies are responsive to people???s identities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public communication campaign</field><field name="subject">organ donation</field><field name="subject">littering</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consenting adults in private: in search of the sexual subject</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Kate, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I examine the ways in which the modern state addresses sex. I want to ascertain by what considerations the state is informed in its relationship to sex. What is behind the state???s regulation of sexual practices? What is its interest in regard to sex? To answer these questions I examine fundamental artefacts of the modern state, especially the law (but also the bureaucracy), as directed by the 1993 English court case of Brown. Brown involves the search for the sexual subject; The Lords in Brown were at a loss for how to conceptualise the subject before them. Their search is my own: who is the sexual subject? What is his relationship to the state?  To answer these questions, Brown directs me for authority to two widely separated moments of supposed classic ???discontinuity???: the 1957 Wolfenden Report, and the late-Victorian Queen???s Bench. These two moments in government - the 1960s and the 1880s - are usually depicted as ideologically different, indicating discontinuity, difference, change and perhaps even revolution between the relative approaches of the state to sex. And yet, in Brown, both are upheld as appropriate contemporary authorities on sex, the individual and the state. Here I take my cue from the Lords and interrogate the artefacts of these two periods in government to ascertain the story of the 20th century state???s relationship to sex. My thesis is a political analysis that incorporates genealogy in its focus on law as indicative of the state. It incorporates a detailed study of primary artefacts of the state: detailed analyses of seemingly discontinuous moments including individual court cases, individual Committees, individual treatises and opinions and political memoirs. I conclude by drawing together my overall argument, that during the 20th century there has been no radical change of the modern state in regard to sex, and that the success of the permissive mythology has generally blinded us to this fact. Not only have we mistaken the nature of the permissive state as concerned with evolution, we have erroneously been persuaded of the blanket repression of the Victorian state. The big break, the discontinuity of the 1960s, that often is described as ???revolutionary??? (and inevitable in the teleology of progress), is a re-configuration of the same object as the Victorian state. The permissive state enacts the latest stage in the great Victorian project of embodying the sexual subject ??? a subject at once embodied and created as an object of control.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo bone formation using Adipose Derived Stromal Stem Cells. The histomorphometry of the ovine defect model</field><field name="creator">Niechoda, Beata, School of Surgery, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of stem cells to augment the healing of bone defects represents an exciting new frontier in many surgical disciplines. This thesis verified the in vitro osteogenic capability of ovine Adipose Derived Stromal Stem Cells (ADSCs) and Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells (BMSCs), examined the in vivo osteogenic potential of the ovine ADSCs population and compared it to the in vivo osteogenic potential of ovine BMSCs. The pilot study used both cell populations, expanded and osteogenically stimulated ex vivo and mixed with resorbable porous hydroxyapatite-calcium carbonate bone graft substitute (ProOsteon 200R, Interpore Cross International, Irvine, CA). This study demonstrated the preferred length of time in ex vivo osteogenic stimulation of the ADSCs and BMSCs populations to promote the bone formation in vivo to be 7 days. In the main ovine study which employed 48 wethers, ADSCs and BMSCs were expanded, stimulated osteogenically for 7 days, mixed with ProOsteon 200R and deposited in an autologous manner into a bilateral medial femoral condyle confined cancellous defect. In vivo performance of 7 treatment groups was examined: 1. ???Bone autograft/ADSCs???, 2. ???Bone autograft/BMSCs???, 3. ???ProOsteon 200R/ADSCs???, 4. ???ProOsteon 200R/BMSCs???, 5. ???Bone autograft???, 6. ???ProOsteon 200R??? and 7. ???Empty defect???. The time-points were: 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The analysis of the harvested specimens used the following methods: computerized tomography, histological assessment, histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. There was a progressive and time dependant increase in woven bone in the defects treated with ADSCs and BMSCs across all time points. The amount of woven bone in the defects treated with the combination of ADSCs and ProOsteon 200R was comparable with the defects treated with the combination of BMSCs and ProOsteon 200R. In addition, the combination of ADSCs or BMSCs and ProOsteon 200R demonstrated no more bone than ProOsteon 200R alone. However, the ???Autograft/BMSCs??? and ???Autograft/ADSCs??? groups demonstrated a remarkable increase in the amount of woven bone formed in the defects across all time points when compared with all other groups. In addition, the amounts of bone formed in the ???Autograft/BMSCs??? and the ???Autograft/ADSCs??? group were comparable across all timepoints. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that ovine ADSCs and BMSCs populations in combination with the bone autograft can increase the formation of woven bone in the autologous orthotopic environment in a comparable manner.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defect chemistry and charge transport in niobium-doped titanium dioxide</field><field name="creator">Sheppard, Leigh Russell, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present project has made a comprehensive assessment of the effect of Nb doping on various charge-transfer related properties of TiO2. Of particular focus, the electrical properties of Nb-doped TiO2 (0.65 at %) have been investigated using the simultaneous measurement of electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power. This investigation was undertaken at elevated temperatures (1073 K -- 1298 K) in equilibrium with a gas phase of controlled oxygen activity (10-10 Pa &lt; p(O2) &lt; 75 kPa). In addition, the effect of segregation on the surface versus bulk composition of Nb-doped TiO2 was also investigated at a function of temperature and oxygen activity. Specifically, the following determinations were undertaken:   The effect of oxygen activity, p(O2) and temperature on both electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power   The effect of Nb on the defect disorder and related electrical properties of TiO2   The determination of equilibration kinetics and the associated chemical diffusion data for Nb-doped TiO2  The determination of Nb bulk diffusion in TiO2  The effect of p(O2), temperature and dopant content on Nb segregation and the related surface composition of Nb-doped TiO2  The obtained electrical properties enable the determination of a defect disorder model for Nb-doped TiO2, which may be considered within the following p(O2) regimes:  Strongly Reduced Regime. In this regime, the predominant ionic defect was anticipated to be oxygen vacancies compensated electronically by electrons. While the transition to this regime (from higher p(O2)) was clearly observed, the predominant defect disorder existing beyond this transition was not confirmed due to an inability to obtain sufficiently low oxygen activity. Metallic-type conductivity behaviour was observed within this transition region.  Reduced Regime I. In this regime, the predominate defect disorder defined by the electronic compensation of incorporated Nb ions by electrons was clearly observed.        Reduced Regime II. In this regime, the predominate defect disorder defined by the ionic compensation of incorporated Nb ions by quadruply-charged titanium vacancies, was clearly observed.  The present project included the determination of diffusion data which included: Temperature dependence of 93Nb tracer diffusion in single crystal TiO2 over the temperature range 1073 K -- 1573 K  Chemical diffusion coefficient over the temperature range 1073 K -- 1298 K and oxygen activity range, 10-10 Pa &lt; p(O2) &lt; 75 kPa These pioneering studies are significant as they enable the prediction of the processing conditions required to reliably 1) incorporate Nb into the TiO2 lattice, and 2) achieve equilibrium with the gas phase.  Finally, the present project included investigations on the effect of Nb segregation on the surface composition of Nb-doped TiO2, with the following outcomes:  Due to segregation, the surface can be significantly enriched in Nb compared to the bulk The extent of enrichment increases as the bulk Nb content or the oxygen activity is decreased  Following enrichment, the surface Nb concentration could be sufficiently high to assume a unique surface phase  The outcomes of the present project are significant as they can enable the processing of TiO2 with enhanced charge transport and controlled surface properties.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar energy.</field><field name="subject">Renewable energy sources.</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide.</field><field name="subject">Niobium.</field><field name="subject">Crystals -- Defects.</field><field name="subject">Semiconductors -- Impurity distribution.</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor doping.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defect disorder, semiconducting properties and chemical diffusion of titanium dioxide single crystal</field><field name="creator">Nowotny, Maria, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Semiconducting properties and related defect disorder for well defined TiO2 single crystal were studies. Semiconducting properties have been determined using simultaneous measurements of two independent electrical properties, including electrical conductivity, ??, and thermoelectric power, S, at elevated temperatures (1073-1323 K) in the gas phase of controlled oxygen activity (10-10 Pa &amp;lt p(O2) &amp;lt 75 kPa). Measurements of s and S were conducted (i) in the gas/solid equilibrium and (ii) during equilibration. Oxygen vacancies have been identified as the predominant defects in TiO2 over a wide range of p(O2). Individual conductivity components related to electrons, electron holes and ions, were determined from the obtained ?? data. The effect of p(O2) on these individual components was considered in the form of a diagram. This work led to the discovery of the formation and diffusion of Ti vacancies. However, the obtained diffusion data indicate that, in the temperature ranges commonly used in studies of semiconducting properties (1000-1400K), the Ti vacancies concentration is quenched and may thus be assumed constant. In addition it was shown that Ti vacancies in appreciable concentrations form only during prolonged oxidation. It was determined that the discrepancies in the reported n-p transition point are related to the concentration and spectrum of impurities as well as the concentration of Ti vacancies. It has been shown that the n-p transition point in high-purity TiO2 is determined by the Ti vacancy concentration. A well defined chemical diffusion coefficient, Dchem, was determined using kinetic data obtained during equilibration. A complex relationship between p(O2) and Dchem was observed. These data showed a good agreement between the obtained diffusion data and defect disorder. Examination of the determined equilibration kinetics, led to the discovery of two kinetic regimes, the result of the transport of defects at different mobilities. The determined data are considered well defined due to the following reasons: 1. The studied specimen was of exceptionally high purity and free of grain boundaries (single crystal) 2. The specimen was studied in the gas phase of controlled and well defined oxygen activity which was continuously monitored. 3. Whenever the experimental data were measured in equilibrium, the gas/solid equilibrium has been verified experimentally. 4. A good agreement between the two, self-confirmatory, electrical properties, including ?? and S has been determined simultaneously and independently. The defect disorder model derived in the present work may be used for tailoring controlled semiconducting properties through the selection of annealing conditions involving the temperature and oxygen activity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Semiconductors</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide cristals</field><field name="subject">Metallic oxides -- Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Electric conductivity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of coal ash and process conditions on coal/char reactivity for PCI into BF</field><field name="creator">Al-Omari, Yaser, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The combustion efficiency of pulverised coal injection PCI is an important factor influencing stability and productivity of the blast furnace. It is affected by coal properties and the process conditions employed for combustion. Economic considerations have driven blast furnace operators to commission a wide range of coals, which differ in type and rank. The main objective of the current project is to study the influence of different operating conditions on combustion performance of coal and to examine the role of coal minerals and their transformations on low and high temperature reactivity. The combustion performance of three PCI coals was investigated under a range of combustion conditions including three combustion temperatures of 900??C, 1200??C and 1500??C, and a range of oxygen concentrations in the gas phase at 1200??C in a drop tube furnace (DTF). The low temperature oxygen reactivity of pyrolysed chars was also measured by observing weight loss in a thermogravimetric (TGA) furnace at 600??C. Physical and chemical properties of pyrolysed and partially combusted chars were characterised using a range of analytical tools including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, BET N2 surface area and Hg porosity. The correlation between char properties and char reactivity at low and high temperatures was also investigated. All three coal samples experienced deactivation during progressive combustion at 1200??C and 23%v O2 i.e. there was a decrease in the reaction rate with proceeding combustion. The carbon structure of the chars became increasingly ordered as quantified by an increase in crystallite height and a decrease in the amorphous carbon proportion in char. Partially combusted char had much higher surface area than a pyrolysed one, which can be attributed to the opening of enormous number of closed pores as combustion proceeds. However, this increase in surface area did not show a direct correlation with char reactivity. Average particle size of ash increased with increasing degree of combustion due to fusion and agglomeration of coal minerals. Under these conditions, carbon structural ordering of char was found to be one of the key factors primarily responsible for loss of char reactivity during combustion. Increasing oxygen content in the gas stream from 23% to 35% at 1200??C resulted in a significant improvement in the combustion performance of three coals, with burnout increasing from ~65% to up more than ~95%. However, increasing oxygen level beyond 35% did not lead to any further significant improvements. Coal burnout was also enhanced by increasing temperature in the range 900??C to 1500??C, such that the improvement was much more rapid in the higher temperature range of 1200??C to 1500??C. This could be related to increased reaction rates at higher temperatures. Pyrolysed char reactivity was measured at low temperature 600??C and 10%v O2 using TGA. The results indicated that the presence of iron and calcium minerals could result in enhanced char reactivity. Coal minerals underwent increased fusion and melting as the combustion temperature was increased. At 1500??C, most ash particles were molten. The level of basic oxides in ash as well as the extent of association between aluminosilicates and basic oxides enhanced the proportion of molten phases. Fusing and melting behaviour of ash particles was found to influence char combustion reactivity at high temperatures. Ash melting on the char surface may hinder gas accessibility to the reactive surface of char, thereby decreasing char burnout. The molten ash particles may coalesce and cover char surface or these molten particles may partially/completely block char pores. The amount of slag phases in ash and the distribution of minerals in char are expected to have a significant influence on ash-char interactions at high temperatures. In summary, the study shows that inorganic matter present in coal can affect coal combustion in a number of ways. Inorganic minerals, such as iron and calcium catalyse char oxidation at low temperatures. On the other hand, these minerals may act as fluxing agents at high temperatures, which could lower the melting point of aluminosilicates minerals in char. The molten phases of ash may restrict the accessibility of oxygen to carbon in char through physical obstruction, thereby, retard char oxidation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and verification of catalytic membrane reactor for H2 recovery from H2S</field><field name="creator">Chan, Pui Yik Peggy, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hydrogen sulfide is toxic by-product of many petroleum, petrochemical and mineral treatment operations. Due to the increasing stringent environment regulations, toxic H2S must be completely removed from industrial waste gases before venting to the atmosphere. The H2S decomposition reaction is a well known thermodynamically limited reaction. Alumina membrane fixed bed catalytic reactors offer the potential for improved conversions at reduced operating temperature due to product separation and catalyst activity. A theoretical and experimental work dealing with a packed bed membrane reactor is the subject of this thesis.  A tubular alumina membrane reactor possessing thermal and corrosion resistance has been developed. A multicomponent permeation study indicated that the fluxes of gases could be quantitatively described as a combination of Knudsen diffusion and viscous flow through the porous alumina membrane. The catalytic decomposition of hydrogen sulfide to hydrogen and sulfur was conducted in membrane reactor incorporating a commercial porous alumina membrane in combination with catalytic function of bimetallic RuMo sulfide catalyst. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility of achieving conversion above the equilibrium conversion. The reaction rate is equal to the intrinsic rate since both internal/external mass transfer and heat transfer resistance are negligible for the size of catalyst particles considered. Results obtained with this system have shown a maximum of 2.3 times the equilibrium conversion at the operating temperature 983K, which was equivalent to the conversion at operating temperature 1200K in a conventional fixed bed reactor. The conversion enhancement was significant for the operation with high sweep to feed molar ratio. The reactor configuration of membrane reactor appeared to have an influence on its performance. Comparative experimental and simulation study showed that the cocurrent mode gave slightly higher conversion over counter-current mode.  Mathematical models were developed for the reactor, based on plug flow behavior. Simulation had been performed in order to validate the model against experimental data. Reactor optimization was carried out using the validated model. The simulation results from the non-isothermal model were in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, the isothermal model which neglected heat effects that took place in the reactor, has leaded to over-predicted conversion. This study also illustrated that predictive simulations could be used to explore the effects of recycle operation; the optimization study showed that the alumina membrane reactor permitting retentate recycle, could achieve up to 48.6% conversion, corresponding to 6 folded of the equilibrium conversion. The simulations provide a logical methodology for experimental planning and design.  To further elucidate the effect of reactor configuration, operation conditions and permeation parameters on the performance of membrane reactors, a high permselective Pt-composite MR model was developed. Comparison of alumina MR and Pt-composite MR was carried out via computer simulation. Porous membrane reactor with higher permeability but lower Permselectivity can attain comparable conversion as the composite membrane reactor with higher permselectivity but lower permeability. Ptcomposite MR was more superior to alumina MR without recycle. Retentate recycle in alumina MR is shown to outperform the Pt-composite MR. Alumina MR was therefore considered as potential candidate for industrial H2S treatment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical engineering -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Membrane reactors.</field><field name="subject">Membrane separation.</field><field name="subject">Catalysts.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Histamine ??? a naturally occurring settlement cue for larvae of the Australian sea urchin Holopneustes purpurascens</field><field name="creator">Swanson, Rebecca, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The importance of chemical cues in triggering the settlement of marine invertebrate larvae has long been recognised but very few such cues have been definitively identified. Larvae of the Australian sea urchin Holopneustes purpurascens, which lives enmeshed in the fronds of macroalgae, are induced to settle by a water-soluble cue produced by the host alga Delisea pulchra. This cue was previously identified as a floridoside-isethionic acid complex. I present evidence in this thesis which supports histamine as the true settlement cue for larval H. purpurascens. The settlement cue was isolated from the polar extract of D. pulchra by bioassay-guided cation-exchange chromatography and identified as histamine using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Algal derived and synthetic histamine at ~5 ??M induced rapid settlement in 80???100 % of larval H. purpurascens. In the first study of its kind for any marine invertebrate, variation in the distribution of new recruits was compared with quantitative variation in the distribution of histamine in the habitat. More than 90 % of new recruits were found on either the foliose red alga D. pulchra or on coralline turf algae. These algae induced &amp;gt90 % settlement of larvae in laboratory assays after 24 h. D. pulchra contained far higher levels of histamine than all other algae, however, the coralline algae lacked measurable histamine. Seawater collected in situ adjacent to D. pulchra induced up to 16 % settlement of older larvae and contained the highest concentration of histamine (~5 nM). With the exception of coralline algae, variation in settlement and recruitment was consistent with the variation among species histamine contents. Initial results supported a biofilm derived settlement cue from coralline algae. I also showed that older H. purpurascens larvae settle in response to lower concentrations of histamine than younger larvae and required less exposure to histamine (10 ??M) in order to initiate irreversible metamorphosis. Histamine induced settlement of two other echinoids with non-feeding larvae. Histamine did not induce settlement of feeding larvae of two echinoids or settlement of non-feeding larvae of asteroids. Histamine may be a general settlement cue for echinoids with direct development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Histamine</field><field name="subject">Sea urchins</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and an intracoronary CD133+ cell infusion in patients with chronic refractory ischaemic heart disease.</field><field name="creator">Kovacic, Jason C., Clinical School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pre-clinical studies suggest that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF) holds promise for the treatment of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). However, its safety and efficacy in this setting, and in particular in patients with chronic refractory 'no-option' IHD, is unclear. Therefore, a clinical study was initiated in 20 such 'no-option' patients, with the aim of assessing the safety and efficacy of both G-CSF administration, and also, that of an intracoronary infusion of G-CSF mobilised CD133+ cells.  The study involved initial baseline cardiac ischaemia assessment (symptom based questionnaire, exercise stress test (EST), nuclear Sestamibi (MIBI) and dobutamine stress echocardiographic (DSE) imaging). Stable 'no-option' IHD patients then received open-label G-CSF commencing at 10&#956;g/kg s/c for five days, with an EST on days four and six (to facilitate myocardial cytokine generation and stem cell trafficking). After three months, cardiac ischaemia assessment and the same regimen of G-CSF and ESTs were repeated, but in addition, leukapheresis and then a randomised double-blinded intracoronary infusion of CD133+ or unselected cells were performed. Final cardiac ischaemia assessment was three months thereafter.  Eighteen male and two female subjects (mean age 62.4) were enrolled. Eight events occurred that fulfilled pre-specified 'adverse event' criteria: four ischaemic (troponin positive) episodes, two episodes of transient thrombocytopaenia (one profound), one episode of gout and one unscheduled hospitalisation for exhaustion. Troponin was positive on 17 further occasions (all CK-MB negative), however, at these instances angina severity was identical to baseline. Importantly, no adverse event(s) resulted in any detectable long-term adverse sequelae for any subject. From baseline to final follow-up, the administration of two cycles of G-CSF was associated with statistically significant improvements in a range of subjective outcomes, including anginal symptoms, quality of life and EST performance (all p &lt; 0.005). However, the  objective MIBI and DSE scans showed only trends towards improvement (all p &gt; 0.1). Compared to unselected cells, an intracoronary infusion of CD133+ cells did not improve either subjective or objective outcomes.  In conclusion, administering G-CSF to patients with refractory 'no-option' IHD warrants careful monitoring, but may be performed with safety. A larger, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of G-CSF in these patients appears warranted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.</field><field name="subject">Ischaemic heart disease.</field><field name="subject">CD133+</field><field name="subject">Cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of coal quality factors on seam permeability associated with coalbed methane production</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xingjin, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cleats are natural fractures in coal that serve as permeability avenues for darcy flow of gas and water to the well bore during production. Theoretically, the development of cleat and coal-seam permeability is related to the rank, type and grade of the coal concerned. The permeability of a coal seam, moreover, may change during gas production, due to either matrix shrinkage, cleat closure or both. Matrix shrinkage and cleat closure are also affected by numerous geological factors, including coal rank, desorption character and geological setting.  A method integrating geochemical and petrographic analysis, reservoir engineering diagnosis, geophysical data and production characteristics has been developed, and used to determine the initial permeability of coal seam on a metre by metre scale. This overcomes the constraint of conventional well test by refining the test intervals.  The effect of coal rank, grade and type on the initial permeability of coal seams was also investigated, with the special reference to the coals of the Galilee Basin. The permeability was estimated using analytical equations based on the permeability data obtained from well tests and from cleat descriptions within the seam section. This aspect of the study showed that the coal type, rank and grade strongly influence the initial permeability of individual coal seams. Increase in ash content has negative effect on cleat development and permeability. On contrast, increasing coal rank and proportion of bright coal lead to reduction in cleat spacing and increase in permeability.  Twenty three core samples collected from the Qinshui Basin in China were evaluated in the laboratory to investigate the effects of coal grade, rank and type on the change in permeability during pressure depletion. The experimental factors included the coal's geochemical properties, the permeability against changing pressure, and strain with pore pressure depletion. This part of the study fund that permeability changes with pore pressure depletion in relation to coal rank, grade and type. The strain values determined by the experiments with pressure depletion were used to identify the mechanical principles associated with changes in permeability during pressure depletion in relation to the rank, grade and type of the coal concerned.  A reservoir simulation study was used to investigate the effects of desorption pressure, geological setting and coal rank on the variation in permeability under in-situ conditions during coalbed methane production, based on a study in the Hedong area, Ordos Basin, China. The simulations allowed history matching of gas and water production from 12 wells with the actual well conditions specified as the model pressure. Good agreement was achieved between the model yields and the actual production data, suggesting that the changing permeability interpreted from the simulation is a realistic representation of the in-situ reservoir properties.  The reservoir simulation study found that the decreases in permeability with production exceeded the increase in permeability caused by matrix shrinkage for nearly all wells in the Hedong area. The magnitude of the decrease in permeability increases as the gap between initial pressure and desorption pressure increases. The decrease in permeability is slower in the zone closest to the fault. The reservoir simulation has demonstrated that coal rank influences significantly the change in permeability during coalbed methane production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coal.</field><field name="subject">Coalbed methane.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced techniques application of on-line partial discharge detection in power cables</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Hao, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Large numbers of installed medium or high voltage power cables are now of advanced age and have gradual insulation deterioration problems. On-line Partial Discharge (PD) measurement has inherent advantages over the conventional off-line measurement, but it also suffers from a very significant Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) problem due to the small PD signal levels being monitored.   The large magnitude EMI signal often completely swamps the smaller magnitude PD signal, making it difficult to monitor anything but extremely large PD activity. To monitor cable condition and to be able to assess insulation degradation trends requires advanced techniques. In this thesis, the issues of sensor selection, digital filtering, software based on-line differential technique and wavelet Transform (WT) de-noising techniques are studied. Their applicability, advantages and limitations are discussed with the simulation and high voltage measurement results. The High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT) type PD sensor is selected after being compared with other sensor in term of sensitivity, universal applicability, frequency response and the installation difficulty. The sinusoidal noise frequency identification and application of the conventional digital filtering are studied. The Least Mean Square (LMS) and Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm digital adaptive filters are compared in detail and RLS adaptive filter is selected. Wavelet transform de-noising technique for on-line PD measurement is carefully studied and the applications of noise reduction are developed. A novel WT threshold value selection algorithm is presented in this thesis. The new WT algorithm is compared with the existing wavelet techniques using numerical simulation and laboratory high voltage testing data on cables. The results show that this new fully automatic WT de-noising method has achieved great progress with the capability of detection 30 pC PD signal during on-site on-line measurement where typical noise level is ten times higher in magnitude. On the basis of traditional off-line differential or balanced detection circuit, a software based on-line differential technique is proposed in this thesis. The novel method developed has the capability to process one whole AC cycle of PD data. It enables traditional q-?? and n-?? distributions to be obtained as well as PD repetition rates and the usual integrated PD parameters. These techniques are developed for the on-site on-line PD measurement in power cables, but they are not limited to cables. They can also be applied to other high voltage equipment with minor or without modification in the data acquisition procedure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric cables</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Being a Good Woman???: suffering and distress through the voices of women in the Maldives</field><field name="creator">Razee, Husna, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study explored the social and cultural context of Maldivian women???s emotional, social and psychological well-being and the subjective meanings they assign to their distress. The central question for the study was: How is suffering and distress in Maldivian women explained, experienced, expressed and dealt with? In this study participant observation was enhanced by lengthy encounters with women and with both biomedical and traditional healers. The findings showed that the suffering and distress of women is embedded in the social and economic circumstances in which they live, the nature of gender relations and how culture shapes these relations, the cultural notions related to being a good woman; and how culture defines and structures women???s place within the family and society. Explanations for distress included mystical, magical and animistic causes as well as social, psychological and biological causes. Women???s experiences of distress were mainly expressed through body metaphors and somatization. The pathway to dealing with their distress was explained by women???s tendency to normalize their distress and what they perceived to be the causes of their distress. This study provides an empirical understanding of Maldivian women???s mental well-being. Based on the findings of this study, a multi dimensional model entitled the Mandala for Suffering and Distress is proposed. The data contributes a proposed foundation upon which mental health policy and mental health interventions, and curricula for training of health care providers in the Maldives may be built. The data also adds to the existing global body of evidence on social determinants of mental health and enhances current knowledge and developments in the area of cultural competency for health care. The model and the lessons learnt from this study have major implications for informing clinicians on culturally congruent ways of diagnosing and managing mental health problems and developing patient-centred mental health services.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women -- Social conditions -- Maldives</field><field name="subject">Women -- Social life and customs -- Maldives</field><field name="subject">Women -- Mental health -- Maldives</field><field name="subject">Women -- Islamic countries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental and theoretical investigation for the machining of hardened alloy steels</field><field name="creator">Lee, Tae-Hong, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research work in this thesis involves an experimental and theoretical investigation for high speed machining of AISI 4140 medium carbon steels and AISI D2 tool steels which are classified as being difficult to machine materials. An experimental program was carried out to determine the cutting forces, chip formation, the secondary deformation zone thickness and surface roughness at different cutting speeds using a 0.4mm and 0.8mm nose radii ceramic tools and -7?? rake angle for annealed (virgin) AISI 4140 and heat treated AISI 4140 steel. Another series of experiments was carried out on the annealed (virgin) and heat treated AISI D2 with 0.4mm, 0.8mm and 1.2mm nose radii CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride) tools under various cutting conditions.  A theoretical model is developed by taking into account the flow stress properties of the AISI 4140 (0.44% carbon content) to use with the Oxley Machining approach. To find the flow stress data for AISI D2 tool steel, the Johnson and Cook empirical constitutive equation is used as the constitutive model. In addition, the magnitude of tool radius should be also considered to determine the prediction of cutting performances. To account for the effect of nose radius edge in hard machining, a simplified geometrical method is used to model the parameters for application in the Oxley Model and works for the cutting conditions considered here. These extensions to the Oxley machining theory were verified by experimental results. These results show a good agreement between the Oxley machining theory and hard machining experiment at data. The research work described in this thesis provides useful data for hard machining conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Metallurgy.</field><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Mechanical properties.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MEMS micro-bridge actuator for potential application in optical switching</field><field name="creator">Michael, Aron, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the development of a novel electro-thermally actuated bi-stable out-of-plane two way actuated buckled micro-bridge for a potential application in optical switching is presented.  The actuator consists of a bridge supported by 'legs' and springs at its four corners. The springs and the bridge are made of a tri-layer structure comprising of 2.5??m thick low-stress PECVD oxide, 1??m thick high-stress PECVD oxide and 2??m thick heavily phosphorus doped silicon. The legs, on the other hand, are 2??m thick single layer heavily phosphorus doped silicon. Both legs and springs provide elastically constrained boundary conditions at the supporting ends, without of which important features of the micro-bridge actuator could not have been achieved. This microbridge actuator is designed, simulated using ANSYS, fabricated and tested. The results from the testing have shown a good agreement with analytical prediction and ANSYS simulation. The actuator demonstrated bi-stability, two-way actuation and 31??m out-of-plane movement between the two-states using low voltage drive. Buckled shape model, design method for bi-stability and thermo-mechanical model are developed and employed in the design of the micro-bridge. These models are compared with Finite Element (FE) based ANSYS simulation and measurements from the fabricated micro-bridge and have shown a good agreement. In order to demonstrate the potential application of this actuator to optical switching, ANSYS simulation studies have been performed on a micro-mirror integrated with the micro-bridge actuator. From these studies, the optimum micro-mirror size that is appropriate for the integration has been obtained. This optimal mirror size ensures the important features of the actuator. Mirror fabrication experiments in (110) wafer have been carried out to find out the appropriate compensation mask size for a given etch depth and the suitable wafer thickness that can be used to fabricate the integrated system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Actuators - Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Microelectromechanical systems -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication -- Switching systems.</field><field name="subject">Optical communications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Kylie Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the nature and processes of autobiographical memory deficits in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Study 1 examined the proposition that difficulties in the retrieval of specific memories present a risk factor for posttraumatic psychopathology. A prospective study of fire-fighters found that a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress was a deficit in retrieving specific memories to positive cues before trauma. Study 2 investigated whether autobiographical retrieval deficits in PTSD can be modified by psychological treatment. Results found that as PTSD symptoms reduced following treatment, individuals with PTSD retrieved more specific memories to positive cues. Together, these results indicated that specific retrieval deficits to positive cues present a vulnerability factor for PTSD. However, this memory style appears to be receptive to modification following therapy. Study 3 investigated the association between autobiographical retrieval deficits and impaired problemsolving in PTSD. Participants with PTSD retrieved more overgeneral categoric memories and took longer to retrieve memories than non-PTSD trauma controls. This deficit was associated with impaired social problem-solving, suggesting that specific retrieval is related to successful problem solving. In an analogue design, Studies 4 and 5 investigated the proposition that resource limitations may underpin autobiographical retrieval deficits. Results generally supported the proposal that reduced cognitive resources may be a mechanism contributing to specific retrieval deficits. Studies 6 and 7 examined rumination as another possible mechanism responsible for these retrieval deficits. Study 6 found high anxious participants retrieved fewer specific memories to positive cues following rumination, compared  to distraction. Study 7 found evidence that negative rumination in the high anxious group increased categoric retrieval, whereas positive rumination had no effect. Study 8 found retrieval of trauma-related self-defining memories was strongly associated with personal goals connected to the trauma. Study 9 found that discrepancies in one???s self construct were related to the retrieval of trauma memories to positive cues. This program of research extends current theories of autobiographical memory by identifying risk, maintenance, and recovery factors in the context of PTSD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss of immune regulatory checkpoints in BAFF transgenic mice</field><field name="creator">Groom, Joanna Ruth, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multiple checkpoints control the survival and activation of auto-reactive B cells. The discovery of the TNF family cytokine BAFF has been crucial to understanding peripheral B cell tolerance mechanisms. Homeostatic levels of BAFF are tightly regulated to maintain tolerance in the periphery. Chronically increased levels of BAFF lead to the survival of autoreactive B cells. Autoimmune patients display elevated serum BAFF levels. BAFF Tg mice model this situation with systemically high levels of BAFF and the subsequent development of two separate but related autoimmune syndromes; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj??gren???s syndrome (SS). The work conducted in this thesis further investigates the defects in tolerance down-stream of self-reactive B cell survival, which may contribute to autoimmune disease development in BAFF Tg mice. Expansion of the Marginal zone (MZ) B cell population correlates with the pathogenesis of several models of autoimmune disease. BAFF Tg mice are unique in that they not only display an increased splenic MZ B cell population, but also MZ B cells are found in the salivary glands of mice developing SS. The examination of genes differentially regulated between MZ and Follicular (Fo) B cells led to the investigation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor biology. The expression of S1P receptors was shown to be required for the positioning of MZ B cells in the spleen. Chronic BAFF stimulation alters the retention of MZ B cells through the alteration of S1P receptors and decreased integrin activation. The alteration of S1P receptors and increased ligand sensitivity leads to the accumulation of MZ B cells in the inflamed salivary glands of BAFF Tg mice. This works provides a potential mechanism for the tissue specificity seen in systemic autoimmune disease. The provision of T cell help to auto-reactive B cells is thought to underlie the development of SLE. BAFF Tg mice deficient in T cells surprisingly developed an SLE-like disease indistinguishable from that of BAFF Tg mice. Autoimmunity in BAFF Tg mice did however require signals through the toll-like receptor (TLR)-associated signalling adaptor, MyD88, which controlled the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. Therefore, autoimmunity in BAFF Tg mice results from altered B cell tolerance, which requires TLR signalling and is independent of T cell help. It is likely that autoimmune patients with elevated levels of BAFF show a similar basis for disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autoimmune diseases</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Regulation</field><field name="subject">B cells</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Transgenic mice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal integrated multi-sensor system for full-scale structural monitoring based on advanced signal processing</field><field name="creator">Li, Xiaojing, School of Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications &amp; School of Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, UNSW</field><field name="description">Modern civil structures as well as loads on them are still too complex to be accurately modeled or simulated. Therefore, structural failures and structural defects are NOT uncommon! More and more full-scale structural monitoring systems have been deployed in order to monitor how structures behave under various loading conditions. This research focuses on how to maximise benefits from such full-scale measurements by employing advanced digital signal processing techniques. This study is based on accelerometer and GPS data collected on three very different structures, namely, the steel tower in Tokyo, the long and slender suspension bridge in Hong Kong, and the tall office tower in Sydney, under a range of loading conditions, i.e., typhoon, earthquake, heavy traffic, and small scale wind. Systematic analysis of accelerometer and GPS data has demonstrated that the two sensors complement each other in monitoring the static, quasi-static and dynamic movements of the structures. It has also been confirmed that the Finite Element Model could under-estimate the natural frequencies of structures by more than 40% in some case. The effectiveness of using wavelet to de-noise GPS measurement has been demonstrated. The weakness and strengths of accelerometer and GPS have been identified and framework has been developed on how to integrate the two as well as how to optimize the integration. The three-dimensional spectral analysis framework has been developed which can track the temporal evolution of all the frequency components and effectively represents the result in the 3D spectrogram of frequency, time and magnitude. The dominant frequency can also be tracked on the 3D mesh to vividly illustrate the damping signature of the structure. The frequency domain coherent analysis based on this 3D analysis framework can further enhance the detection of common signals between sensors. The developed framework can significantly improve the visualized performance of the integrated system without increasing hardware costs.  Indoor experiments have shown the excellent characteristics of the optical fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) for deformation monitoring. Innovative and low-cost approach has been developed to measure the shift of FBG???s central wavelength. Furthermore, a schematic design has been completed to multiplex FBGs in order to enable distributed monitoring. In collaboration with the University of Sydney, the first Australian full-scale structural monitoring system of GPS and accelerometer has been deployed on the Latitude Tower in Sydney to support current and future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural analysis (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Structural stability.</field><field name="subject">Automatic data collection systems.</field><field name="subject">Detectors.</field><field name="subject">Global Positioning System.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crafting connections: original music for the dance in Australia, 1960-2000.</field><field name="creator">Hocking, Rachel, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents the artistic connections made between composers and choreographers in Australia during the period 1960-2000. These 40 years saw a growth in the establishment of dance companies, resulting in many opportunities for composers to write original music for original dance works. The findings of original dance-music are tabulated in an extensive database giving details of 208 composers and over 550 music compositions written specifically for dance. Examples of choreographer and composer collaborative relationships and attitudes to each other???s artforms are discussed. Further examination of how these relationships have affected the sound of the music is detailed in four case studies. These concern the works The Display (music by Malcolm Williamson, choreography by Robert Helpmann, 1964), Poppy (music by Carl Vine, choreography by Graeme Murphy, 1978), Ochres (music by David Page, choreography by Stephen Page, 1994), and Fair Exchanges (music by Warren Burt and Ros Bandt, choreography by Shona Innes, 1989). These case studies look at dancemusic collaborated in different styles: ballet, modern dance, dance-theatre and experimental dance. This discussion is carried out through the analysis of the context of the collaborative relationships, and the temporal and interpretive aspects of the original dance-music. It is found through the investigation of collaborative relationships and discussion of these case studies, that similar methods of writing are used when composing music for theatrical dance, regardless of the type of dance. These methods show that composers have intentionally crafted scores that fulfil needs in the dance works and that are suited to choreographers??? intentions. Importantly, it is also found that involvement with dance has influenced some composers??? styles, aided musical innovation and added significantly to the corpus of Australian music.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music and dance -- Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Composers -- Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Choreographers -- Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Dance music -- Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular changes in the topoisomerase genes, gyrA and parC, and their contribution to fluoroquinolone resistance in the pathogenic Neisseria.</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Tiffany Rose, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined molecular changes in the quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of the topoisomerase genes, gyrA and parC of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis and their contribution to fluoroquinolone resistance (FQR). Initially models of FQR emergence were developed from analysis of resistant mutants generated in vitro. The effects of the nature and order of sequential changes in GyrA and ParC on FQR were explored by correlating QRDR changes with ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations. The in vitro models were validated by comparisons of QRDR changes and MICs in two populations of wild-type FQR N. gonorrhoeae over a wide MIC range (0.09 to 24??g/mL), and in a wild type FQR meningococcus. The in vitro activities of three newer quinolones with differential activity on GyrA and ParC were compared with that of ciprofloxacin. Key findings were that the initial QRDR changes always occurred in gyrA and were the predominant influence on phenotypic expression of FQR. QRDR alterations were acquired sequentially and two GyrA and two ParC changes represented the full complement of changes observed in gonococci and two GyrA and one ParC change those in meningococci. GyrA alterations at Ser-91 in gonococci and Thr???91 in meningococci were pivotal for the development of further resistance. ParC changes required the presence of two GyrA alterations for any major impact on FQR. ParC substitutions, Ser-87???Arg and Glu-91???Gly in gonococci and Cys- 85???Asp and Glu-91???Lys in meningococci led to the expression of the highest FQR levels. Examination of FQR in wild-type meningococci was necessarily restricted, but analyses using the broader MIC range available in in-vitro-derived FQR meningococci (0.09 to 16??g/mL) revealed the first ParC changes in N. meningitidis. The study also redefined QRDR boundaries and described novel mutations within them. The nature of sequence changes in GyrA and ParC in FQR Neisseria also affected the relative activities of the three newer quinolones. Trovafloxacin was the most active quinolone in vitro but MIC differences with ciprofloxacin were mutation-dependent. Grepafloxacin and moxifloxacin were only slightly more active than ciprofloxacin in the presence of multiple QRDR changes.

A commercial electron accelerator was used to prepare bulk samples by exposure to electron irradiation under different conditions. A morphological characterisation of the control talc was carried out using microscopy techniques and focused on the particle size, shape and surface features of individual particles. Asperity dimensions vs. Roughness values were compared. Assessment of the bulk properties of the powders as a function of absorbed dose showed no serious impact on the quality or efficacy of the powder for cosmetic applications. The particle size and the level of dust expelled during impact were maintained. Changes to the surface chemistry of the irradiated powders were apparent from an increase in pH and water retention with increasing dose. Improvements to the fragrance retention occurred for both irradiated powders tested. Importantly a satisfactory microorganism level was achieved with the lowest absorbed dose level tested i.e. 5 kGy. Analysis of the crystallography did not show the development of a new phase. Mechanical testing using a slip-peel tester found an increase in the stick-slip behaviour occurred for the powder exposed to the highest absorbed dose only. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) testing of the lift-off force showed an increase in adhesion with increasing dose. Surface roughness increased with dose, while no change in elastic properties was found using nanoindentation suggesting the differentiating factor is due to surface features. Microstructural analysis used the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Voids were observed, which decrease in size, yet increase in number with increasing voltage. Prior to void development a loss of crystalinity is seen using electron diffraction. Explorative data analysis using factor analysis and Independent Component Analysis was performed on the void development data to discover the controlling mechanisms. Two distinct normally distributed populations were identified, each driven by 2-3 critical mechanisms. The distinct behaviour differences of the mechanisms may be utilised for characterisation of more complex properties of crystal microstructures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irradiation.</field><field name="subject">Morphology.</field><field name="subject">Talc.</field><field name="subject">Microstructure.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of Japanese vocabulary by Chinese background learners: the roles of transfer in the productive and receptive acquisition of cognates and polysemy.</field><field name="creator">Kato, Toshihito, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">As is widely known, Japanese and Chinese not only share the common logo graphic orthography called ???kanji??? or ???hanzi??? respectively, but also share a number of kanji compounds as cognates, many of which share the same or similar meaning. The major objective of this dissertation is to investigate the roles of transfer and the difficulty in Chinese background learners??? (CBLs???) use and acquisition of Japanese kanji compounds and kanji words. In particular, under what condition and how CBLs transfer Chinese words into Japanese counterparts is investigated.  The results of a lexicality judgement test, an oral production test, and a translation test showed that acquisition of partially deceptive cognates, which share the same orthography with partly the same and partly different meanings, was often prolonged. It was also found that the difficulty of acquisition of partially deceptive cognates varied according to their cross-linguistic semantic condition and task type. In the oral production test, CBLs frequently used L1 words by adapting them into L2 phonology both successfully and unsuccessfully when they had no prior knowledge of the L2 counterparts. In addition, negative transfer was detected even when CBLs had a correct knowledge of the L2 word. The results of the translation test revealed that CBLs are liable to misinterpret the meaning of partially deceptive cognates when one of their meanings happens to make sense within the context. Additionally, it is suggested that CBLs might create different types of interlanguage depending upon the cross-linguistic semantic condition and relative frequency of the L2 input for each meaning of the partially deceptive cognates.  The transferability of polysemy was found to be constrained by prototype condition, learners??? existing L2 knowledge, and task type. While transferability correlated well with the perceived prototypicality of the L1 items in CBLs??? oral production, transfer was also at work for the less prototypical items in their comprehension task. The findings indicate that the transferability of Chinese words into their Japanese counterparts is constrained by multiple factors. Further, both positive and negative transfer influence CBLs??? production, comprehension, and interlanguage construction of Japanese vocabulary in a complex manner.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language -- Acquisition</field><field name="subject">Japanese language -- Vocabulary</field><field name="subject">Japanese language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of female sexuality in chick-lit texts and reading Anais Nin on the train</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Emma Kate, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">My critical essay uses Foucault???s theory of discursive formation to chart the emergence of the figure of the single modern woman as she is created by the various discourses surrounding her. It argues that representations of the single modern woman continue a tradition of perceiving the female body as a source of social anxiety. The project explores ???chick-lit??? as a site within the discursive formation from which the single modern woman emerges as a paradoxical figure; the paradoxes fundamentally linked to her sexuality. This essay, then, essentially seeks to investigate representations of female sexuality within chick-lit, exposing for scrutiny the paradoxes inherent in and around the figure of the single modern woman. My fictional piece is a work of erotica. It is divided into four sections: The Reader, The Writer, The Muse and The Critic. Essentially it explores the relationships between female sexuality and literature; between female sexuality and feminist, post-feminist and patriarchal values and between literature and issues of truth, perspective and representation. The two works complement each other to illuminate the paradox of female sexuality: one from a theoretical perspective and the other from a fictional perspective. The critical work focuses on female sexuality and its relationship to, and development within, the current social context. Chick-lit, as a new and immensely popular genre of fiction which holistically explores the lives of single modern women was useful for examining the relationship between the sexual persona of the single modern woman and society. The fiction is concerned with a narrower focus: specifically the sexual life of the single modern woman. Through the creative process, it became apparent that working within the genre of ???erotica??? would be not only more useful than working within chick-lit, but more powerful in exploring the themes I was interested in. The creative work draws on numerous points of interest raised in the critical work from, for example, the grander notions of the relationship between object and discourse ??? in this case female sexuality and literature ??? and the female body as a source of social fascination and anxiety to finer observations such as what it means to have sex ???like a man.??? In essence, the creative work seeks to examine the many faces of the single modern woman as a sexual being and to illuminate, on an intimate level, the many conflicts between and surrounding those faces and to suggest that while paradox remains in female sexual ideology, the single modern woman will remain suspended in a kind of sexual paralysis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- Sexual behavior</field><field name="subject">Feminism and literature -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction -- Women authors -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Foucault, Michel -- Contibutions in sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiology and psychophysics of vibrotactile sensation</field><field name="creator">Sahai, Vineet, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Response characteristics and tactile coding capacities of single neurons of the dorsal column nuclei (DCN), and the dorsal horn, in particular, neurons of the spinocervical tract (SCT), were investigated in anaesthetized cats. Purely dynamically-sensitive tactile neurons of the DCN could be divided into two classes, one associated with hair follicle afferent (HFA) input, the other with Pacinian corpuscle (PC) input. The HFA-related class was most sensitive to low-frequency (&amp;lt50 Hz) vibration, had phaselocked responses to vibration frequencies up to ~75 Hz and had a graded response output as a function of vibrotactile intensity changes. PC-related neurons had broader vibrotactile sensitivity, extending to ~300 Hz with tightest phaselocking between 50 and 200 Hz. The SCT neurons in the lumbar dorsal horn had tactile receptive fields on the hairy skin of the hindlimb and a very limited capacity to signal, in a graded way, the intensity parameter of the vibrotactile stimulus. Furthermore, because of their inability to respond on a cycle-by-cycle pattern at vibration frequencies above 5-10 Hz, these neurons were unable to provide any useful signal of vibration frequency beyond ~5-10 Hz, in contrast to DCN neurons. In the parallel human psychophysical study, the capacity for vibrotactile frequency detection and discrimination was examined in five subjects in glabrous and hairy skin. The vibrotactile detection threshold values obtained at four standard frequencies of 20, 50, 100 and 200 Hz were markedly higher on the hairy skin than on the glabrous skin. The discrimination task was examined by means of a two-alternative, forced-choice psychophysical procedure. Measures of the discriminable frequency increment (?????) and the Weber Fraction (????? / ??), revealed similar capacities for frequency discrimination at the two different skin sites at the standard frequencies of 20, 100 and 200 Hz, but an equivocal difference at 50 Hz. Cutaneous local anaesthesia in the dorsal forearm produced a marked impairment in vibrotactile detection and discrimination at the low frequencies of 20 and 50 Hz but little effect at higher frequencies, confirming that vibrotactile detection and discrimination in hairy skin depend upon superficial receptors at low vibrotactile frequencies, but depend on deep, probably Pacinian corpuscle receptors for high frequencies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Vibration -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Touch -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Senses and sensation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hepatitis B and C associated cancer and mortality: New South Wales, 1990-2002.</field><field name="creator">Amin, Janaki, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines cancer and mortality rates among people diagnosed with hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infection in New South Wales (NSW) from 1990 through 2002, by linking hepatitis notifications with the NSW Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and National Death Index.  Of the 39101 HBV, 75834 HCV and 2604 HBV/HCV co-infection notifications included 1052, 1761 and 85 were linked to cancer notifications  and 1233, 4008 and 186 were linked to death notifications respectively. Of 2072 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) notifications to the CCR 323, 267 and 85 were linked to HBV, HCV and HBV/HCV co-infection notifications.  Incidence of HCC was 6.5, 4.0 and 5.9 per 1000 person years for HBV, HCV and HBV/HCV co-infected groups. Risk of HCC in those diagnosed with hepatitis was 20 to 30 times greater than the standard population. There was a marginally statistically significant increased risk of immunoproliferative malignancies associated with HCV infection (SIR=5.6 95% CI 1.8 ???17.5).  Risk of death for those with hepatitis was significantly greater, 1.5 to 5 fold, than the general population with the greatest risk among those with HBV/HCV co-infection. The primary cause of HBV deaths was liver related, particularly HCC, whereas in the HCV groups drug related deaths were most frequent.  Among people with HCV, risk of dying from drug related causes was significantly greater than from liver related causes (p=0.012), with the greatest increased risk in females age 15- 24 years (SMR 56.9, 95%CI 39.2???79.9).  Median age at diagnosis of HCC varied markedly by country of birth and hepatitis group: HBV 66, 63 and  57years ; HCV 51, 68 and 71 years; unlinked 69, 70 and 64 years  for Australian, European, and Asian-born groups, respectively (P&lt;0.0001 for all groups).  While the risk of cancer, particularly HCC, is elevated among people with HBV and HCV infection, the absolute risk remains low. Young people with HCV face a higher mortality risk from continued drug use than from liver damage related to their HCV infection. The influence of IDU in the epidemiology of HCC in New South Wales was possibly reflected in the varying distributions of age and country of birth.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer -- Risk factors -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Mortality -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Viral carcinogenesis -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of the signaling protein Ras guanine releasing protein 4 (RasGRP4) in human mast cells</field><field name="creator">Katsoulotos, Gregory Peter, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both atopic and non-atopic asthma. Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein 4 (RasGRP4) is a mast cell-restricted guanine nucleotide exchange factor and diacylglycerol (DAG)/ phorbol ester receptor whose function has not been deduced. RT-PCR analysis of 40 asthmatic patients and 40 non-asthmatic controls demonstrated a higher hRasGRP4 mRNA expression in a subgroup of the asthmatics. A RasGRP4-defective variant of the human mast cell line HMC-1 was used to create stable clones expressing green fluorescent protein-labeled human RasGRP4 for monitoring the movement of this signaling protein inside mast cells before and after exposure to phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and for evaluating the protein???s ability to control the development, phenotype, and function of mast cells. Transcript-profiling approaches revealed hRasGRP4 constitutively regulates the expression of numerous genes in the HMC-1 cell line. For example, expression of hRasGRP4 in HMC-1 cells substantially decreased GATA-1 levels without altering GATA-2 levels, suggesting that hRasGRP4 regulates mast cell commitment of multipotential progenitors in part by controlling the intracellular levels of at least one lineage-dependent transcription factor for hematopoietic cells. hRasGRP4 resided primarily in the cytosol before HMC-1 cells were stimulated with PMA. After exposure to PMA, hRasGRP4 translocated to the inner leaflet of the cell???s plasma membrane and then to perinuclear and Golgi compartments. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 were activated during this translocation process, and the PMA-treated cells transiently increased their expression of the transcripts encoding the interleukin 13 receptor IL-13R??2 and numerous other proteins. The accumulated data in our mast cell model suggest hRasGRP4 translocates to various intracellular compartments via its DAG/PMA-binding domain to regulate those signaling pathways that allow mast cells to respond quickly to changes in their tissue microenvironments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interleukins</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Ras proteins</field><field name="subject">Mast cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigations on gas explosions in partially confined regions</field><field name="creator">Park, Dal Jae, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary objectives of the described research were to examine the underlying physical phenomena occurring during flame/obstacles interactions in various chambers of low L/D ratio and to develop a new empirical equation for explosion venting.  A literature review suggested that the propagating flame/obstacle interactions in enclosures with large L/D ratio (&amp;gt 2) result in flame acceleration and subsequent pressure build-up during a gas explosion. However, the interactions in practical situations with small L/D &amp;lt 2 were not extensively studied.  In this thesis the first investigation involved the flame interaction with different single and multiple obstacles in a 1/20th model of real enclosure. Results provided the basis for flame propagation, local flame displacement speed probability density functions (pdfs), mean flame velocity and explosion pressure.  The second investigation of the study involved the flame interaction with multiple bars within chambers of different L/D ratios. The results provided mean flame velocities on each stage, as a function of nondimensional time, and pressure developments as a function of L/D ratio.  The final investigation is associated with gas explosion venting. The predictive ability between existing models on explosion venting and experimental results obtained in this thesis were undertaken and found to be deficient. Consequently a new empirical model for predicting explosion venting was developed. The new model was validated with experimental data published in literature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Explosions.</field><field name="subject">Flame.</field><field name="subject">Ventilation.</field><field name="subject">Explosions -- Safety measures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Korea employers' federation and Korean industrial relations</field><field name="creator">Jun, In, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines and explains the development of the KEF between its formation in 1970 and 2003. Using a historical and case study approach, the thesis analyses the strategic behaviours of the KEF. The guiding questions shaping this thesis are drawn from the intersection of resource dependence theory and the literature on employer associations. In response to these questions, chronological narrative explains the development of Korea's political economy and industrial relations between 1970 and 2003 as it affected the KEF. It pays particular attention to the growth of the chaebols -- family-owned and controlled business conglomerates -- as political as well as economic forces, their changing relations with government and their labour management strategies.  This thesis argues that when Korea's chaebol owners formed their association, the KEF, they did so in the absence of immediate clear or concrete challenges to their business interests. Instead, they evaluated the likelihood of some future external challenges and chose to act on these perceptions. In particular, they strategically chose to prepare for the possible re-emergence of an independent labour movement many years into the future rather than trust forever in governments? repressive systems of labour control.  Resource dependence theory proved useful for examining the KEF's internal dynamics. The KEF and its chaebol members were linked through asymmetric inter-dependence. The chaebols dominated KEF membership, took financial responsibility for KEF operations and formally ruled through its governance structure. The KEF's high dependence on the chaebols inhibited any shift away from its chaebol-dominated profile. This also meant that the KEF leadership found it extremely difficult to exert control over member firms' behaviour. However, as the relationship between the chaebols and their external environment changed, internal power resources (industrial relations expertise) and external ones (a militant union movement, tripartite arrangements) helped the KEF Secretariat increase its authority. This allowed it to achieve greater discretionary power in its internal and external domains.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial relations -- Korea (South)</field><field name="subject">Korea (South) -- Politics and government -- 1960-1988.</field><field name="subject">Korea (South) -- Politics and government -- 1988-.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corrosion rate of steel reinforcement in concrete in seawater and influence of concrete crack width</field><field name="creator">Chang, Zhen-Tian, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a research of the corrosion mechanism and corrosion rate of steel reinforcement in concrete. Experimental results are presented to compare the corrosion behaviours of steel reinforcement in two blended-cement concretes in seawater. The experimental program included a study of the influence of crack width on macrocell corrosion, an investigation of the procedure for the determination of polarisation curves of steel in concrete and, an evaluation of the corrosion rate of steel in concrete and the influence of crack width as determined by a new polarisation curve analysis.  A mechanism is proposed to interpret the different influences, in both the short and long term, of concrete crack width on the macrocell corrosion rate. This mechanism is based on the finding that the corrosion-spread phenomenon is caused by polarisation effects. An oxygen-depletion mechanism is also proposed to explain the much lower macrocell corrosion rate in the slag cement concrete than that in the flyash cement concrete.  The procedure for polarisation testing of steel in concrete is found to be critical to obtaining correct polarisation curves. A twotest procedure is verified to be an appropriate procedure and used in this investigation. Experimental polarisation curves of steel in concrete are found to be very different to those expressed by the kinetic Butler-Volmer equation and, this is considered to be a result of the influence of the passive film on the steel surface in concrete.  An empirical polarisation formula is developed and its interpretation is based on the postulation of two parallel kinetic processes occurring at the steel/passive-film/concrete interface; one is the active corrosion process and the other is the film growth/dissolution process. The formula is used to model experimental polarisation curves of steel in concrete through curvefitting analyses. Good curve-fitting results are obtained between the polarisation test curves and model curves. The results are used for evaluation of the corrosion rate and Tafel behaviours of steel in the two concretes and for assessment of the influence of crack width on the corrosion rate within the crack zone.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Steel -- Corrosion.</field><field name="subject">Seawater corrosion.</field><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete -- Corrosion.</field><field name="subject">Concrete -- Cracking.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problem frames approach to strategic requirements for web services</field><field name="creator">Jha, Anju, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Web Services can be seen from two views ? one that it is a purely technological advance and the other that it is a capability that an organisation can deploy to meet a business objective. Much has been said about the first view but not much has been said about the second view. The underlying premise of this research is that in the context of an ever-increasing competitive environment, an organisation needs to take into account these important aspects: What is the business strategy of the organisation, which adopts Web Services? Does the IT align with the business strategy of the organisation? The aim of this research is to capture and describe business-IT problems in the context of strategic requirements and Web Services. As a means to align a Web Services initiative with business strategy, we propose a Requirements Engineering framework to capture the business objectives of an organisation from strategy to implementation. The methodology that we propose provides a roadmap from business strategy, to the strategic objectives to implementation in four dimensions: innovation, customer relationship management, infrastructure management and financials. The proposed framework extends the e-Business Modelling Ontology (eBMO) of Pigneur and Osterwalder by applying Bleistein et al?s Progression of Problems to understand the strategic objectives and the business context.  We have presented 2 examples as proof of concept. We have experimented with our methodology on Amazon.com and Dell.com ?cases developed from the literature? as these organisations are aggressively pursuing Web Services as a part of their IT and business strategy. We use the Problem Frames approach to capture the business objectives and the problem context of an organisation deploying Web Services and to create a strategic alignment between the business strategy and the information technology. The approach presented in this thesis is used to understand Amazon and Dell?s strategy and strategic objectives. It was possible to capture strategic objectives and the strategic context through combination of the eBMO and Progression of Problems. It was also possible to trace this to Web Services requirement description through application of Problem Frames. The framework combines with Bleistein et al?s Progression of Problems at the strategic level and applies Problem Frames at the operational level. It takes the problem-oriented view of the whole process, but does not apply Problem Frames throughout, at least not in their original formulation by Jackson.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web services.</field><field name="subject">Business strategy series.</field><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An airborne Lidar canopy segmentation approach for estimating above-ground biomass in coastal eucalypt forests</field><field name="creator">Turner, Russell Sean, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is growing interest in airborne lidar for forest carbon accounting and precision forestry purposes. Airborne lidar systems offer a cost-effective, versatile, operationally flexible and robust sampling tool for forest managers. The objective of this study was to develop and test lidar canopy surface enhancement and segmentation processes for estimating dominant above-ground biomass (DAB) in a harvested eucalypt forest on the Central Coast of New South Wales (Australia). The Crown Infill, Trim and Smooth (CITS) process, incorporating a series of filters, algorithms, and selective multi-stage smoothing, was used to enhance lidar canopy surfaces prior to segmentation. Canopy segmentation was achieved using a vertical crown template approach termed the Spatially and Morphologically Isolated Crest (SMIC) process. SMIC delineates dominant tree crowns by detecting elevated crown crests within a 3D lidar canopy surface. Consolidated crown units constitute the basic sampling, analysis and reporting units for wall-to-wall forest inventory. The performance, sensitivity and limitations of these procedures were evaluated using a combination of simulated forest models and actual lidar forest data. Automated crown polygons were used as a sampling template to extract dominant tree height values which were converted to DAB estimates via height-to-biomass relationships derived from field survey and on-site destructive sampling. Results were compared with field based tree height and biomass estimates. Compared against a manually derived crown map from a 2ha field plot, canopy segmentation results revealed a producer???s accuracy of 76% and overall accuracy of 67%. Results indicated a trend toward greater crown splitting (fragmentation) as trees increase in age, height, stem diameter and crown size. Extracted dominant tree height values were highly correlated with ground survey height estimates (r2 0.95 for precision survey and r2 0.69 for standard survey). There was also no significant difference between SMIC and manual crown height estimates. SMIC units overestimated ground-based DAB by 5%; this increased to 36% with the inclusion of segmentation errors. However, SMIC estimation of total plot above-ground biomass (AGB) was within 9% of the ground-based estimate. Results are encouraging considering the mixed-species, multi-aged composition of the forest, and the combined effects of SMIC segmentation and lidar height errors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest ecology -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Forest biomass</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Native title &amp; constitutionalism: constructing the future of indigenous citizenship in Australia</field><field name="creator">Corbett, Lee, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that native title rights are fundamental to Indigenous citizenship in Australia. It does this by developing a normative conception of citizenship in connection with a model of constitutionalism. Here, citizenship is more than a legal status. It refers to the norms of individual rights coupled with democratic responsibility that are attached to the person in a liberal-democracy. Constitutionalism provides the framework for understanding the manner in which Australian society realizes these norms.  This thesis focuses on a society attempting to grapple with issues of postcolonialism. A fundamental question faced in these societies is the legitimacy of group rights based in pre-colonization norms. This thesis argues that these rights can be legitimized when constitutionalism is understood as originating in the deliberations connecting civil society with the state; which deliberations reconcile individual rights with group rights in such a way as to resolve the issue of their competing claims to legitimacy.  Civil society is the social space in which politico-legal norms collide with action. The argument constructed here is that native title is built on norms that have the potential (it is a counterfactual argument) to contribute to a postcolonial civil society. This is one in which colonizer and colonized coordinate their action in a mutual search for acceptable solutions to the question 'how do we live together?'.  The optimistic analysis is tempered by a consideration of the development of native title law. The jurisprudence of the High Court after the Wik's Case has undermined the potential of native title to play a transformative role. It has undermined Indigenous Australians' place in civil society, and their status as equal individuals and responsible citizens. In seeking to explain this, the thesis turns from jurisprudence to political sociology, and argues that an alternative model of constitutionalism and civil society has supplanted the postcolonial; viz., the neoliberal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Land tenure.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Legal status, laws, etc.</field><field name="subject">Native title (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Social policy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barriers to occupational noise management</field><field name="creator">Williams, Warwick Hamilton, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work undertook the examination of the perceived barriers that exist to the management of occupational noise exposure in the workplace. Exposure to excessive levels of noise results in cumulative damage to the hearing mechanism of the ear and a subsequent hearing loss. This hearing loss is permanent and does not recover over time.  Initially the conventional method of addressing or controlling noise exposure was through Hearing Conservation Programs and more recently through Occupational Noise Management Programs that take more of a risk management approach. However, the numbers of new hearing loss claims submitted through the various ???workcover??? and ???worksafe??? authorities in Australia continue to remain very high. Hearing loss claims rank within the top two in number of new claims each year.  The research conducted shows that there are four main barriers perceived by individuals that work against the institution of effective preventive action. These four main barriers in order of priority are hearing protectors, information, culture and management, and are themselves each composed of several lesser factors. Each of the barriers was examined more closely in an attempt to better understand how they operate and the potential to discover how they may be overcome.  To briefly summarise the main barriers: 1) Hearing protectors are uncomfortable, impede communication and are unpleasant to wear; 2) Individuals would like more information on noise reduction and for this information to be supplied by management;  3) workplace and management culture needs to be supportive of occupational health and safety in general and with the implementation of supportive preventive measures in particular; and 3) management needs to be seen to place importance on occupational health and safety in the workplace in general and the reduction of excessive noise in particular.  By being aware of the barriers and operation the design of future more effective intervention or better noise management programs should be possible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise barriers.</field><field name="subject">Noise control.</field><field name="subject">Occupational health and safety -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlates of protective immunity in individuals who are exposed to Hepatitis C but appear uninfected</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Lisa, Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The hepatitis C virus (HCV) currently infects 3% of the world???s population, with chronic infection in 50-80% of exposed individuals. A small subset of individuals who are exposed to HCV do not develop anti-HCV antibodies, persistent viraemia or chronic hepatitis despite generating HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These individuals are believed to develop an immune response which rapidly clears viraemia prior to the induction of an antibody response. Circumstantial evidence supports the likelihood that some of these individuals may generate these same responses and outcomes on repeated occasions of HCV infection. HCV-specific cellular immune responses in seronegative subjects have been the subject of only limited prior study, in part due to the lack of appropriate recombinant antigens and assay systems. Therefore, this thesis described the development and validation of an interferon-? (IFN-?) ELISPOT assay using overlapping peptides (n=441). Using this assay, HCV-specific cellular immune responses were detected in 5/10 (50%) of chronically infected subjects. Responses were identified more frequently, and were directed against more regions of the HCV genome, than with traditional assay systems. This IFN-? ELISPOT assay, a comparable interleukin (IL)-2 ELISPOT assay, and a multiplex in vitro cytokine production assay were then used to evaluate HCV-specific cellular immune responses in three cohorts of seronegative subjects at high-risk of exposure to HCV ??? babies born to infected mothers, multiply-transfused subjects with thalassaemia, and high risk injecting drug users. Cellular immune responses were evaluated in 23 infants born to HCV-antibody positive women. Responses were not detected in infants born to HCV-PCR negative mothers. IFN-? production was detected in 1/11 infants born to viraemic mothers using the ELISPOT assay, with cytokine production observed in an additional 3/5 infants studied using the in vitro cytokine production assay. HCV-specific cellular immune responses were assessed in a cohort of multiply transfused subjects with thalassaemia using assays for cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, IFN-? and IL-2 ELISPOT, as well as lymphocyte proliferation and in vitro cytokine production. Responses were detected in 6/13 chronically infected subjects (46%), 4/7 subjects who had cleared infection (71%), and 14/17 seronegative subjects (82%). The seronegative subjects had responses which were broader and higher in magnitude than those with chronic HCV infection, although lower and narrower than in subjects who had cleared prior HCV infection. IFN-? and IL-2 ELISPOT assays, in additional to in vitro cytokine production assays, were performed on 41 injecting drug users (IDUs), with responses detected in 6 (15%). Seronegative IDUs with HCV-specific cellular immune responses had been injecting for a mean of 7.7 years, and reported multiple risk factors for exposure to HCV. The combined data from these three cohorts indicate that the HCV-specific cellular immune responses detected in seronegative subjects were generally broad in specificity. Cytokine production was generally Th1-biased, a pattern which has previously been associated with an increased likelihood of clearance in primary infection. The findings also suggest that responses can be maintained for decades after exposure, and may provide protection against repeated exposures. In summary, cellular immunity against HCV is evident in some seronegative high risk subjects, suggesting that the cellular immune responses may efficiently facilitate viral clearance. Understanding the mechanisms of this immune response pattern will allow better understanding of the host response to HCV and may provide key insights into vaccine design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Protective Immunity</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An auditory event-related potential study of recovery cycle effects in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder</field><field name="creator">Clunas, Nathan, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have reported evidence of impaired auditory information processing in patients with schizophrenia. Some of these findings, such as the impaired P50 sensory gating, are consistent with a loss of inhibitory function.  In auditory ERP studies using pairs of stimuli the size of the second response relative to the first response has been taken to indicate the extent to which responsiveness has recovered after a period of time. This variation of responsiveness has been termed the 'recovery cycle,' and is regarded as a measure of the time course of recovery of excitability of cortical neurons after stimulation.  The recovery cycle of the auditory N1 ERP component was measured in 17 patients with schizophrenia and 17 age- and sexmatched healthy volunteers, and 12 patients with bipolar disorder and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Subjects performed a visual distraction task while listening to tone pairs, presented with intra-pair intervals of 1, 3, 5 or 7 s, with inter-pair intervals ranging between 9-13 s. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly reduced N1 amplitudes for S1 stimuli compared to healthy volunteers. For N1 amplitudes elicited by S2 stimuli there was a significant group effect whilst the main effect of intra-pair interval was not significant. A significant quadratic effect across ISI intervals was present in the healthy volunteer group, which was not significant in the schizophrenia group. Patients with bipolar disorder did not differ in N1 amplitudes elicited by S1 stimuli compared to healthy volunteers. There was no evidence of significant group differences in the recovery cycle effect between bipolar patients and matched healthy volunteers.  The results provide evidence of inhibitory auditory processing deficits in schizophrenia, and further suggest that deficits in attention found in patients with schizophrenia, as indexed by reductions of auditory N1 amplitude, may be associated with impairments in inhibitory processes. In addition, different recovery cycle effects were found in patients with schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder. Further study of the recovery cycle paradigm used in this study may lead to the development of an objective diagnostic tool.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychiatry -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Auditory perception.</field><field name="subject">Schizophrenia.</field><field name="subject">Manic-depressive illness.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) blind system identification for operational modal analysis using the Mean Differential Cepstrum (MDC)</field><field name="creator">Chia, Wee Lee, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The convenience of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), over conventional Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA), has seen to its increasing popularity over the last decade for the purpose of evaluating dynamic properties of structures. OMA features an advantage of requiring only output information, which is in tandem with its main drawback of lacking scaled modeshape information. While correctly scaled modeshapes can be assumed under a restrictive assumption of spectrally white inputs, in reality, input spectra are at best broadband in nature.  In this thesis, an OMA method for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) applications in mechanical structures is developed. The aim is to separate MIMO responses into a collection of Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) processes (matrix FRF) using cepstral-based methods, under less restrictive and hence more realistic coloured broadband excitation. Existing cepstral curve-fitting techniques can be subsequently applied to give regenerated FRFs with correct relative scaling.  This cepstral-based method is based on the matrix Mean Differential Cepstrum (MDC) and operates in the frequency domain. Application of the matrix MDC onto MIMO responses leads to a matrix differential equation which together with the use of finite differences, directly solves or identifies the matrix FRF in a propagative manner. An alternative approach based on whitened MIMO responses can be similarly formulated for the indirect solution of the matrix FRF. Both the direct and indirect approaches can be modified with a Taylor series approximation to give a total of four propagative solution sequences.  The method is developed using relatively simple simulated and experimental systems, involving both impulsive and burst random excitations. Detailed analysis of the results is performed using more complicated Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) and MIMO systems, involving both driving and non-driving point measurements. The use of the matrix MDC method together with existing cepstral curve-fitting technique to give correct relative scaling is demonstrated on a simulated MIMO system with coloured inputs. Accurate representation of the actual FRFs is achieved by the matrix MDC technique for SIMO set-ups. In MIMO scenarios, excellent identification was obtained for the case of simulated impulsive input while the experimental and burst random input cases were less favourable.

When examples are scarce, however, it is difficult for these algorithms to evaluate the relative quality of two or more rules which fit the examples equally well. This dissertation proposes, implements and examines a general technique for modifying rule evaluation in order to improve learning performance in these situations. This approach, called Description-based Evaluation Function Transfer (DEFT), adjusts the way rules are evaluated on a target concept by taking into account the performance of similar rules on a related support task that is supplied by a domain expert. Central to this approach is a novel theory of task similarity that is defined in terms of syntactic properties of rules, called descriptions, which define what it means for rules to be similar. Each description is associated with a prior distribution over classification probabilities derived from the support examples and a rule's evaluation on a target task is combined with the relevant prior using Bayes' rule. Given some natural conditions regarding the similarity of the target and support task, it is shown that modifying rule evaluation in this way is guaranteed to improve estimates of the true classification probabilities. Algorithms to efficiently implement Deft are described, analysed and used to measure the effect these improvements have on the quality of induced theories. Empirical studies of this implementation were carried out on two artificial and two real-world domains. The results show that the inductive transfer of evaluation bias based on rule similarity is an effective and practical way to improve learning when training examples are limited.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine learning.</field><field name="subject">Transfer learning.</field><field name="subject">Inductive transfer.</field><field name="subject">Empirical Bayes.</field><field name="subject">Multitask learning.</field><field name="subject">Computer programming.</field><field name="subject">Logic programming.</field><field name="subject">Induction (Logic)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a mathematical N-line model for simulation of beach changes</field><field name="creator">Dang, Van To, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of a new N-Line model, which provides a practical tool for simulating regional beach changes induced by short and long-term processes, is described in this thesis. The new N-Line model consists of four main modules that together describe the hydrodynamic and morphological responses. The four constituent modules have been integrated based on a wide range of research including the utility and function of commercial or freeware models. They are RCPWAVE wave module, time-averaged and depth-integrated current module, sediment transport module based on Bailard (1981) and contour change morphological module. Two different time-scales and two staggered grid systems for hydrodynamic and morphological simulations were adopted alternatively. For short-term 2D profile changes, new N-Line model applicability has been examined using data from the laboratory to the field. For ideal beaches, new N-Line can simulate an offshore storm bar generation or an onshore accretion due to high or low energy waves. For SUPERTANK large-scale flume data, the predicted profile matched the measured profile well, especially the bar height and position. For beach profile data from the Gold Coast, storm-induced variations of barred profiles were reasonably modelled. The new N-Line model compared well with other commonly used cross-shore models such as SBEACH and UNIBEST. A new schematisation for a non-monotonic profile and DUNED inclusion were introduced. Sensitivity tests on cross-shore sediment coefficient (Kq), smoothing parameter (??s) and water level fluctuations were performed. For long-term 3D beach changes, the new N-Line model applicability has been tested with various boundary conditions using idealized and real field data. Two periods, 17 and 16 months, of beach changes before and after a major bypass plant commenced operation in 2001 at Letitia Spit were simulated. The profile and shoreline changes were predicted reasonably well. Empirical model parameters were determined after a range of sensitivity and calibration testing. The new N-Line model showed its better performance compared to one-line models. It can handle various boundary conditions, especially bypass conditions. The N-Line model is not only capable of modelling planform variations but also cross-shore profile changes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coast changes -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Shirelines -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the cooperative binding properties of 1,1'-bis(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines)</field><field name="creator">Jones, Michael William, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The design of partially reduced 1,1'-bisisoquinoline derivatives was investigated with the aim of controlling the conformation about the C1-C1' axis. This would produce ligands with unusual but predictable ligand binding properties, particularly cooperativity. The introduction of ??-aminoalkyl, ??-azidoalkyl, ??-alkynyl and ??-alkenyl groups onto the nitrogens of the reduced bisisoquinoline core was conducted with the intention of broadening the scope of the ligand. Subsequent epoxidation, hydroboration and Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of terminal unsaturated groups and nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine of the corresponding known bischloroacetyl derivative afforded representative examples of new ligand types for future study. 1,1'-Bis(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline) was found to readily condense with a wide range of aldehydes to give imidazolines and aspects of the rates of condensation were determined. Mono-alkyl bisisoquinolines were obtained efficiently by cleavage of the imidazolines through a newly defined treatment with sodium cyanoborohydride under acidic conditions. A procedure was developed whereby these two steps could be accomplished in a sequential one-pot process. The mono-alkyl compounds were further derivatized through acetylation, alkylation, sulfonylation and reductive alkylation. Synthetic strategies towards ??-excessive N-arenealkyl derivatives were established with the goal to create scaffolds for the coordination of ??-deficient systems, of which the X-ray crystal structures of three N-arenemethyl derivatives were elucidated. These are each closely related in conformation about the C1-C1' axis. Reaction of two examples of the N-arenealkyl compounds with copper(II) and palladium(II) chlorides, furnished the first known examples of this type of highly reduced 1,1'-bisisoquinoline-metal complex. Single crystal X-ray crystallography was used to analyse the structures of these complexes in the solid state. Preliminary physicochemical investigations were conducted with a view to determining the conformation of the molecules about the bisisoquinoline C1-C1' bond. The interaction of intermolecular N-aryl ??-excessive compounds with ??-deficient systems was found to result in minimal spectroscopic changes. Complementary intramolecular ??-excessive/??-deficient systems were found through fluorometric analysis to readily form charge transfer complexes. Finally, it was determined that the conformation of 1,1'-bis[2-(methoxy-18- crown-6)ethanoyl-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline] could be controlled by the simultaneous coordination of the termini of the diperchlorate salt of 1,3-diaminopropane to the crown ether moieties of the ligand. A range of new N-substituted bisisoquinolines have been synthesised and methods developed for determining interactions between parts of these molecules that through these physicochemical characteristics could allow monitoring of conformational behaviour in future studies.

A murine model was developed to investigate the role of the tissue factor-thrombin-protease activated receptor pathway in renal ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI). In this model, mice received 25 minutes of ischaemia and subsequent periods of reperfusion. C57BL6, protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) knockout mice, and tissue factor (TF) deficient mice were used. Following 24 hours IRI, PAR-1 deficiency resulted in protection against severe renal failure compared to the C57BL6 mice (creatinine, 118.2 ?? 6.3 vs 203 ?? 12 ??mol/l, p&amp;lt0.001). This was confirmed by lesser tubular injury. By 48 hours IRI, this resulted in a survival benefit (survival, 87.5% vs 0%, p&amp;lt0.001). Treatment of C57BL6 mice with hirudin, a specific thrombin inhibitor, offered renoprotection at 24 hours IRI (creatinine, 107 ?? 10 ??mol/l, p&amp;lt0.001), leading to a 60% survival rate at 48 hours IRI (p&amp;lt0.001). TF deficient mice expressing less than 1% of C57BL6 mouse TF were also protected (creatinine, 113.6 ?? 7 ??mol/l, p&amp;lt0.001), with a survival benefit of 75% (p&amp;lt0.001). The PAR-1 knockout, hirudin treated C57BL6 and TF deficient mice had reduced myeloperoxidase activity and tissue neutrophil counts compared to the C57BL6 mice, along with reduced KC and MIP-2 chemokine mRNA and protein expression. Hirudin treatment of PAR-1 knockout mice had no additional benefit over PAR-1 absence alone, suggesting no further contribution by activation of other protease activated receptors (creatinine at 24 hours IRI, 106.5 ?? 10.5 ??mol/l, p&amp;gt0.05). Furthermore, immunofluoresence staining for fibrin(ogen) showed no difference between C57BL6 and PAR-1 knockout mice, suggesting no major contribution by fibrin in this model. Renal IRI resulted in increased levels of TF mRNA expression in the C57BL6, PAR-1 knockout, and hirudin treated C57BL6 mice compared to normal controls, suggesting that TF mRNA expression was upregulated in this model. This resulted in increased TF functional activity in the C57BL6 and PAR-1 knockout mice, but TF activity was negligible in hirudin treated C57BL6 and TF deficient mice. The data therefore suggests that the TF-thrombin cascade contributes to renal IRI by signalling via PAR-1 that then regulates chemokine gene expression and subsequent neutrophil recruitment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kidneys -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Reperfusion injury -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Ischemia -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traffic engineering for multi-homed mobile networks.</field><field name="creator">Chung, Albert Yuen Tai, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research is motivated by the recent developments in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to support seamless integration of moving networks deployed in vehicles to the global Internet. The effort, known as Network Mobility (NEMO), paves the way to support high-speed Internet access in mass transit systems, e.g. trains; buses; ferries; and planes; through the use of on-board mobile routers embedded in the vehicle. One of the critical research challenges of this vision is to achieve high-speed and reliable back-haul connectivity between the mobile router and the rest of the Internet. The problem is particularly challenging due to the fact that a mobile router must rely on wireless links with limited bandwidth and unpredictable quality variations as the vehicle moves around. In this thesis, the multi-homing concept is applied to approach the problem. With multi-homing, mobile router has more than one connection to the Internet. This is achieved by connecting the mobile router to a diverse array of wireless access technologies (e.g., GPRS, CDMA, 802.11, and 802.16) and/or a multiplicity of wireless service providers. While the aggregation helps addressing the bandwidth problem, quality variation problem can be mitigated by employing advanced traffic engineering techniques that dynamically control inbound and outbound traffic over multiple connections. More specifically, the thesis investigates traffic engineering solutions for mobile networks that can effectively address the performance objectives, e.g. maximizing profit for mobile network operator; guaranteeing quality of service for the users; and maintaining fair access to the back-haul bandwidth. Traffic engineering solutions with three different levels of control have been investigated. First, it is shown, using detailed computer simulation of popular applications and networking protocols(e.g., File Transfer Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol), that packet-level traffic engineering which makes decisions of which Internet connection to use for each and every packet, leads to poor system throughput. The main problem with packet-based traffic engineering stems from the fact that in mobile environment where link bandwidths and delay can vary significantly, packets using different connections may experience different delays causing unexpected arrivals at destinations. Second, a maximum utility flow-level traffic engineering has been proposed that aims to maximize a utility function that accounts for bandwidth utilization on the one hand, and fairness on the other. The proposed solution is compared against previously proposed flow-level traffic engineering schemes and shown to have better performance in terms of throughput and fairness. The third traffic engineering proposal addresses the issue of maximizing operator?s profit when different Internet connections have different charging rates, and guaranteeing per user bandwidth through admission control. Finally, a new signaling protocol is designed to allow the mobile router to control its inbound traffic.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traffic engineering -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Wireless Internet.</field><field name="subject">Mobile computing.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Internetworking (Telecommunication)</field><field name="subject">Routers (Computer networks)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of new factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis</field><field name="creator">Du, Ximing Robin, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The regulatory pool of cholesterol is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is key to how mammalian cells sense and respond to changes in cellular cholesterol levels. The extent of cholesterol esterification by the ER-resident protein, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT), has become the standard method for monitoring cholesterol transport to the ER and is assumed to reflect the regulatory pool of ER cholesterol. The oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), is thought to trigger intracellular cholesterol transport to the ER. Chapter 3 of this thesis addressed whether or not cholesterol esterification necessarily reflects cholesterol movement to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER as determined by SREBP processing. Three agents that inhibited the ability of 25HC to induce cholesterol esterification (progesterone, nigericin, and monensin) did not have a corresponding effect on 25HC suppression of SREBP processing. Moreover, ACAT inhibition did not alter the sensitivity of SREBP processing to 25HC. These findings indicate that cholesterol esterification by the ER-resident protein ACAT is dissociable from cholesterol transport to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER.  In order to readily analyse and quantify the processing of SREBP-2, the master regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, the second part of this study (Chapter 4) established a stable cell-line (13A/PS) that expresses the fusion protein PLAP-BP2 (secreted form of placental alkaline phosphatase joined to the luminal loop of SREBP-2 on the NH2- terminal side of Site-1). Processing of PLAP-BP2 mimics the cleavage of SREBP. The PLAP-BP2 cleavage assay was shown to be a valuable method for analysing and quantifying SREBP-2 processing. Compared to transiently transfected cells, the stable 13A/PS cells were more responsive to changes of sterol status in regards to PLAP secretion. Considering the reliability and consistency of the experiments, the 13A/PS cell-line is therefore a useful tool for the study of SREBP-2 processing.  Akt is a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation and survival that is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 investigated the role of PI3K/Akt in activation of SREBP-2 increased in response to statin treatment and various cholesterol depletion approaches. The increase of SREBP-2 processing by statins or insulin-like growth factor-1 was blunted by treatment with a potent and specific inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, or when a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative form of Akt (DNAkt) was expressed. Furthermore, LY294002 treatment down-regulated SREBP-2 or -1c gene targets, and decreased cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Fluorescence microscopy studies indicated that LY294002 disrupts transport of the SREBP escort protein, SCAP, from the ER to the Golgi. This disruption was also shown by immunofluorescence staining when DN-Akt was expressed. These data indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in SREBP-2 transport to the Golgi, contributing to the control of SREBP-2 activation. The results provide a crucial mechanistic link between the SREBP and PI3K/Akt pathways which may be reconciled teleologically since synthesis of new membrane is an absolute requirement for cell growth and proliferation.  This thesis has provided the first evidence that there is an Akt dependent step in SREBP/SCAP transport to the Golgi, adding another input into SREBP activation beside the familiar lipid end products. However, since the Akt protein target involved in the ER-to-Golgi transport of SREBP/SCAP is still elusive, further studies are required to elucidate how Akt exerts its effects, which will potentially reveal new component(s) or pathway(s) involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cholesterol.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Society building - welfare, time and social capital</field><field name="creator">Patulny, Roger, Social Policy Research Centre, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Social capital is a relatively new concept compared to welfare, though debates on the advantages of different welfare regimes and the links between state provision and social participation are tentatively connecting the two areas. Esping-Andersen classifies welfare regimes into three types - market-focused liberal, status-focused corporatist, and equality-focused social democratic regimes. Each has been well studied with regards to the effects of commodification (market dependency), stratification (inequality and stigma), and familialisation (paternalistic family dependency). However, such focus largely upon economic rather than social concerns. This thesis examines the proposition that welfare can ???build society??? by promoting these social aspects otherwise known as social capital. The social capital concept has definition and measurement problems with causality and the capture of social activities rather than just norms. Acknowledging, this, social capital is preferably defined from the literature as norms of trust, networks of association membership, and practices of volunteering and socialising. A critical reading highlights the importance of separating bonding social capital, as captured in Bourdieu and Coleman???s exclusive networks, from bridging social capital, more akin to Putnam???s civil society and thus closer to social welfare. This thesis examines numerous empirical measures of bridging social capital, by looking at norms and networks through the World Values Survey, and practices through the Multinational Time Use Study across nine OECD countries. Results show that social democratic welfare regimes do promote social capital, with high levels of trust, membership and social activity. Corporatist welfare regimes show low but constant levels of social capital, whilst liberal welfare regimes have experienced declines in trust. Increasingly means-tested liberal regimes register high levels of commodification, with poor work-leisure balances, and are also more stratified with higher levels of inequality, whilst attitudes stigmatising immigrants and the poor are apparent amongst all less trusting countries. Familialisation is explicit in corporatist values and male/female work imbalances, and implicit in liberal values and poor family payments, with reduced social capital contributions from women as a result. Overall empirical testing of relations between welfare regimes and social capital show that both are linked most positively under universal rather than meanstested conditions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social capital (Sociology)</field><field name="subject">Social welfare</field><field name="subject">Social networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiplexed optical fibre sensors for civil engineering applications</field><field name="creator">Childs, Paul, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fibre-optic sensors have been the focus of a lot of research, but their associated high cost has stifled their transferral from the laboratory to real world applications. This thesis addresses the issue of multiplexing, a technology that would lower the cost per unit sensor of a sensor system dramatically.  An overview of the current state of research of, and the principles behind, multiplexed sensor networks is given. A new scheme of multiplexing, designated W*DM, is developed and implemented for a fibre Bragg grating (FBG) optical fibre sensor network. Using harmonic analysis, multiplexing is performed in the domain dual to that of the wavelength domain of a sensor. This scheme for multiplexing is compatible with the most commonly used existing schemes of WDM and TDM and thus offers an expansion over, and a resultant cost decrease from, the sensor systems currently in use.  This research covered a theoretical development of the scheme, a proof of principle, simulated and experimental analysis of the performance of the multiplexed system, investigation into sensor design requirements and related issues, fabrication of the sensors according to the requirements of the scheme and the successful multiplexing of eight devices (thus offering an eightfold increase over current network capacities) using this scheme.  Extensions of this scheme to other fibre sensors such as Long Period Gratings (LPGs) and blazed gratings were also investigated. Two LPGs having a moir?? structure were successfully multiplexed and it was shown that a blazed Fabry Perot grating could be used as a tuneable dual strain/refractive index sensor. In performing these tests, it was discovered that moir?? LPGs exhibited a unique thermal switching behaviour, hereto unseen.  Finally the application of fibre sensors to the civil engineering field was investigated. The skill of embedding optical fibre in concrete was painstakingly developed and the thermal properties of concrete were investigated using these sensors. Field tests for the structural health monitoring of a road bridge made from a novel concrete material were performed. The phenomenon of shrinkage, creep and cracking in concrete was investigated showing the potential for optical fibre sensors to be used as a viable research tool for the civil engineer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical fibre sensors.</field><field name="subject">Wavelength-frequency multiplexing.</field><field name="subject">W*DM.</field><field name="subject">FBGs.</field><field name="subject">Moir??

However, the term "appropriation" is hotly debated in the fields of Indigenous and Post-colonial studies for technologies such as the English language, writing and visual art have for a long time assumed the connotation of 'colonial property'. The object of this enquiry is to explore the extent to which Indigenous Australian appropriations of the English language, writing and visual art, provide -- though they differ widely in terms of themes, strategies and styles -- a terrain for discussing unexplored issues of intercultural representation, epistemology and interpretation. The dissertation offers a close reading of literary and visual "practices of proximity", such as interlanguages, editorial relations and cross-cultural exhibitions, in order to demonstrate that Indigenous Australian appropriations variously disrupt neo/colonial claims of property.  This dissertation is organized thematically, and consists of three parts entitled "Interlanguages", "Intertextual Performances" and "Contested  Sights". Each part consists of three chapters, which move from an initial questioning of technology as colonial property, to the close analysis of some Indigenous appropriations and non-Indigenous counterappropriations. Situated at the crossroads between Indigenous and Postcolonial studies, the dissertation offers insights into the timely debates on sovereignty, difference and subject positioning. The combination of theories of "appropriation" and "intersubjectivity" illuminates a new path in theorizing Australian intercultural relations. The Australian contact zone is unveiled as a place of Indigenous sovereignty where the colonial subject is ontologically and epistemologically constituted in correlation with Indigenous peoples. Thereby, the Indigenous/non-Indigenous intersubjective relation is recognised as the ground from which notions of the colonial self and other derive and which colonial reifying selfreflection has misconceived as separate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication.</field><field name="subject">Communication and culture.</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural studies -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Communication -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Art -- Cross-cultural studies -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The malarial carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II gene as a target for DNAzyme therapy</field><field name="creator">Katrib, Marilyn, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Today, malaria remains the biggest killer of the third world, killing over a million people every year, despite intensive research efforts. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSII) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in pyrimidine biosynthesis of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. PfCPSII is a unique target for DNAzyme therapy due to the presence of two unique insertion sequences of 700bp and 1800bp that exist within the mature mRNA transcript. Previous studies have demonstrated that exogenous delivery of nucleic acids such as ribozymes and DNAzymes targeting PfCPSII insertion II effectively inhibited the growth of P. falciparum cultures at sub-micromolar levels.  The objective of this study was to investigate the insertion sequences within CPSII from rodent malaria species P. berghei, P. chabaudi and P. yoelii in order to further validate the insertions as DNAzyme targets in vivo. In addition, the insertions were isolated from another human malaria parasite, P. vivax. All Plasmodium CPSII genes investigated encoded two highly hydrophilic insertion sequences of similar size and nature, in the precise position seen in PfCPSII. Although these insertions are poorly conserved, border and internal regions of high homology are present.  Thirty-one new DNAzymes were designed to target the P. berghei CPSII insertion II region, seventeen of which demonstrated the ability to cleave the target RNA. Of these, four showed significant cleavage activity, with the DNAzyme MD14 cleaving greater than half the target RNA within five minutes. These DNAzymes were then further characterised for kinetic behaviour. Again, MD14 displayed favourable kinetics of cleavage and was chosen as a suitable candidate in an in vivo rodent malaria trial.  Analysis of parasitaemia from the MD14 treated mice indicated the administration of MD14 effected a highly statistically significant reduction of parasitaemia, although this reduction was low (6.3%). More efficient DNAzyme delivery methods were investigated in order to improve DNAzyme efficacy and included the novel use of porphyrin conjugated DNAzymes. The porphyrin-conjugated DNAzymes improved uptake into parasitised red blood cells and significantly reduced parasite growth in vitro at nanomolar levels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malaria -- Drug therapy.</field><field name="subject">Genetics -- Research.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the constitutional and legal frameworks for the regulation of racial vilification in Australia</field><field name="creator">Meagher, Daniel, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis involves an analysis of the constitutional and legal frameworks for the regulation of racial vilification in Australia. In doing so, it has two aims. First, I wish to discern the constitutional parameters for Australian laws where political communication forms part of the conduct sought to be regulated. The High Court has recognised that the Australian Constitution contains an implied right to freedom of political communication (???implied freedom???). It operates to invalidate legislative and executive action which impairs the effective operation of our system of constitutional government. The scope of the implied freedom remains unclear, however. There is no consensus on the High Court as to what constitutes ???political communication??? or when a law can be said to impair constitutional government. I will seek to answer these open constitutional questions and in doing so outline a methodology to determine whether racial vilification may count as political communication. If so, I will then consider whether this, consequently, imperils the validity of existing Australian racial vilification laws. And second, I want to critically evaluate the normative legitimacy of Australian racial vilification laws and propose legislative reform in the event that my analysis reveals any serious flaws in the current legal framework. The methodology outlined in the first part of the thesis provides the relevant constitutional parameters within which any proposed legislative reform must fall. In the result, I conclude that racial vilification can amount to political communication but that most Australian racial vilification laws are, nevertheless, compatible with the implied freedom and valid as a consequence. However, my evaluation of Australian civil and criminal racial vilification laws reveals that most are seriously flawed. Consequently, a detailed reform program is outlined to remedy the major legislative deficiencies. It is my view that the law has an important but limited role to play in the regulation of racial vilification in Australia. It is certainly reasonable and prudent to have precise and well-targeted laws to proscribe and punish racial vilification but policy and law-makers should not overstate or overestimate the ability of the law to effect grass roots attitudinal and behavioural changes on matters of race.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of drying on anthocyanins in blueberries</field><field name="creator">Lohachoompol, Virachnee, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Blueberries are well known for their high anthocyanin content and the health benefits. Fresh blueberries have limited shelf life and thus are kept frozen or processed. Since freezing is expensive, low cost processing methods, particularly drying are being devised. Various drying treatments were compared with regard to drying time and quality of the dried product in terms of anthocyanin and polyphenolic contents as well as antioxidant activity. The drying treatments involved high temperature in a cabinet dryer and low temperature in a heat pump dryer. Freeze drying was used as a reference treatment. Highbush (Vaccinium corymbosum L., cultivars Crunchie, Star, and Sharpe) and rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei, cultivars Climax, Powderblue, and Brightwell) blueberries were used in this study. Pre-treatments included osmotic dehydration or skin abrasion. The temperature and concentration of the osmotic solution were the main parameters contributing to the reduction of drying time. Mechanical skin abrasion was more effective than osmotic dehydration in reducing drying time and minimising the loss of anthocyanin and phenolic contents of the blueberries in air drying treatments. The thickness of cuticle and the structure of epicuticular waxes affected the drying rate of different cultivars of blueberries. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to identify different anthocyanins in the blueberry samples. Delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin were the main contributors to the total anthocyanin content of the fresh and dried samples. Degradation products of anthocyanins were observed in samples where the anthocyanin contents declined as a result of drying treatments. The anthocyanin content and profile, phenolic content, and antioxidant activity of mulberries (Morus nigra), and Makiang (Cleistocalyx nervosum), a Thai native fruit, were also analysed. There was no significant difference between total anthocyanin content of blueberries and mulberries. In contrast, the total phenolic content and antioxidant effect of mulberry were significantly higher than those of blueberries and Makiang. Skin abrasion and high temperature drying resulted in the fastest drying rate and highest anthocyanin retention. Anthocyanin profiles differed in various cultivars of blueberries. Within the same cultivar, amounts of each anthocyanin varied with pre-treatments and drying methods but the distribution of monomeric anthocyanins was similar.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blueberries.</field><field name="subject">Food -- Preservation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Stem Cell Pathway??? gene expression in human foetal limbus and cadaveric human limbal epithelium</field><field name="creator">Figueira, Edwin C, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stem cells play a vital role in the turn over of permanently self-renewing tissues (e.g. corneal epithelium, epidermis, bone marrow). Stratified cornea epithelia serve, as ideal tissue models for studying ???stemness???, as the site of cells in the different stages of differentiation are anatomically easily identifiable. Studies targeting limbal stem cell maintenance, in-vitro gene expression during storage and differentiation will benefit future therapeutic applications (e.g. corneal transplantation). Knowledge of stem cell behaviour will help explain the pathophysiology of corneal related ocular surface disorders (e.g. idiopathic limbal stem cell deficiency, pterygium and limbal dermoids), establish new treatment modalities (e.g. allogenic cellular transplants) and help promote invivo expansion of residual stem cell populations in deficiency states. The major obstacle in the progress of research on limbal stem cells is the lack of knowledge of phenotypic markers of limbal epithelial stem cells. This project first studied the limbal expression of phenotypic markers that were discovered in other human adult and embryonic stem cell populations using microarray differential expression studies. Gene expression profiles of the relatively primitive human foetal limbus were compared with that of the central cornea. Microarray was also performed to identify the differential gene expression profile of cultured primary human limbal epithelial cells, when compared to the limbal epithelial cell population isolated after 5 serial cultures. 33 genes were upregulated in the human foetal limbus and primary cultured human limbal epithelium, when compared respectively to the central foetal  cornea (first experiment) and the limbal epithelial cell population after the 5th trypsin passaged culture (second experiment). Four foetal limbal and primary limbal epithelial upregulated genes (CK15, CK14, Cdh3, and Wnt4) were confirmed to be upregulated by semi quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical experiments on the human foetal cornea, adult human cadaveric cornea and cultured human limbal epithelial cells. The microarray defined phenotypic profile of both the foetal limbus and cultured adult limbal epithelial cells will help identify these cells in in-vitro and in-vivo states. The expression of these 4 selected markers in the limbal dermoid and pterygium suggests that limbal epithelial cells containing a stem cell population are involved in the pathogenesis of these two disorders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stem cells -- Research</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory during hypnotic identity delusions.</field><field name="creator">Cox, Rochelle Evelyn, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to examine the impact of an identity delusion on autobiographical memory and develop a model of deluded autobiographical memory to guide future research in this area. Given the difficulty of studying identity delusions in isolation from other clinical disorders, this thesis presents six experiments that used hypnosis as a laboratory model of identity delusions. Chapter 1 reviews literature from three distinct areas, including delusions, autobiographical memory, and hypnosis. Chapter 1 reviews a model of the self and autobiographical memory proposed by Conway (2005) and outlines the value of using hypnosis instrumentally to model delusions of self. Chapter 2 presents two experiments that established hypnosis as a suitable paradigm for investigating identity delusions. These experiments examined the parameters of the hypnotic delusion and tested the impact of the delusion on self and autobiographical memory. Chapter 3 presents two experiments that continued to examine the characteristics of autobiographical memory during a hypnotic identity delusion. These experiments indexed the specificity, source, perspective, and qualitative features of autobiographical memories elicited during a suggested identity delusion. Chapter 4 presents two experiments that investigated memory processing during a hypnotic identity delusion. These experiments illustrated the shifting accessibility of autobiographical memories during a hypnotic identity delusion. Finally, Chapter 5 draws the empirical findings together to discuss the value of hypnosis as a technique for modelling identity delusions and the ways in which a hypnotic identity delusion influences autobiographical memory. Importantly, Chapter 5 proposes a model of deluded autobiographical memory that integrates Conway???s (2005) self-memory system with relevant aspects of Langdon and Coltheart???s (2000) two-factor theory of delusions. Using this proposed model as a framework, Chapter 5 discusses the clinical and theoretical implications of the findings from this thesis and suggests future research directions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Identity (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Delusions.</field><field name="subject">Hypnotism -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Autobiographical memory.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular evolution of hepatitis C virus quasispecies.</field><field name="creator">Oon, Aileen, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The viral dynamics of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in newly acquired infection are not well understood. HCV exists within an individual as a spectrum of minor variants termed quasispecies. The evolution of minor variants may contribute to viral escape of the host?s immune response, thereby facilitating development of chronic infection. The hypervariable 1 region (HVR1) is the most heterogeneous part of the HCV genome and contains a putative B-cell epitope. Thus, diversity in HVR1 could be a strategy used to evade neutralising antibodies. Acutely infected individuals (n=24) were examined with the aim of defining HVR1 quasispecies diversity in acute infection. The characterisation of the E1/HVR1 sequence and host specific evolution of HCV minor variants in treatment nonresponders was also investigated.  HCV E1/HVR1 fragments were amplified from 48 sera using a combined reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Products were TA cloned into pCRIITOPO and approximately 10-20 clones were sequenced from each sample. HVR1 quasispecies diversity was examined longitudinally via sequence analysis. Quasispecies diversity was characterised primarily by mean nucleotide diversity. The mean HVR1 diversity of the acute cohort (n=48; 2.12% ?? 2.22) was lower than the diversity obtained for a cohort of chronically infected individuals (n=99; 4.5% ?? 5.1). There was no significant difference in mean HVR1 diversity between the HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected groups (p=0.99) or between the clearer and non-clearer groups (p=0.85). Examination of amino acid usage and the hydropathic profile of each position in HVR1 revealed that sequence variation was confined to specific sites. The investigation of host specific evolution of HVR1 quasispecies demonstrated that minor variants (comprising 10- 20% of a population) became the dominant species over time in two treatment non-responders. These variants bore mutations that were not reflected in the consensus sequence of their respective populations at the initial timepoint analysed. Common infection was identified by 98% HVR1 sequence homology within two pairs of individuals. The evolution of common strains appeared to be different between individuals, suggesting host pressures may influence quasispecies evolution. This thesis provided an insight into the viral dynamics and host specific evolution of acute phase quasispecies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus.</field><field name="subject">Host-virus relationships.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of map and B-SCP in order to manage evolution of strategic it requirements</field><field name="creator">Babar, Abdul Razzaq, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The scope of requirements engineering must include high-level business objectives and strategies to achieve traceability between IT and business needs in order to ensure alignment.  B-SCP handles this issue effectively. However, we must also deal with the evolution of business strategy operationlised in business processes and supporting it. MAP, goal/strategy modelling technique handles such evolution effectively. Integration of MAP with B-SCP can help us to address deficiency of addressing requirements evolution in the B-SCP framework.  This thesis presents the first steps in a research project that integrates the requirements engineering methodologies, B-SCP and MAP, in order to manage evolution of strategic IT. Semantic similarities between B-SCP and MAP motivate us to combine both techniques. The integration theory results in three alternative mechanisms through which we can connect MAP with B-SCP. The usefulness of the three mechanisms is tested on two exemplars -- small one and detailed one. These mechanisms have advantages and disadvantages depending upon the complexity of the business system. MAP has a Gap Analysis process inbuilt so this saves on the overhead of inventing a new approach. In addition, MAP also extends B-SCP's capability by the addition of non-deterministic process modelling which allows B-SCP framework to offer multiple views of requirements. During the integration process, we encountered a number of issues. One important was that B-SCP identifies goals as a snapshot in time which are aligned hierarchically from higher level model to lower level model, however MAP identifies processes that strive to achieve goals and do not provide alignment between different levels of MAPs. This was a challenging issue to deal with during the integration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology -- Management.</field><field name="subject">Systems engineering.</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the role of the neuropeptide hypocretin/orexin in stress</field><field name="creator">Furlong, Teri, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hypocretin (Hcrt, also known as orexin) is a neuropeptide produced exclusively by neurons located in the dorsal tuberal hypothalamus. Hcrt has been implicated in a range of functions associated with high arousal states including feeding, wakefulness, motor activity, autonomic function and stress. This thesis investigated the role of Hcrt in two forms of psychological stress, conditioned fear to context and restraint. Three complementary techniques were used in rats. (i) Lesions of Hcrt containing neurons and surrounding cells were made with a Hcrt-saporin toxin and the cardiovascular and behavioural response to stress investigated using radiotelemetry. (ii) Fos was used as an indicator of Hcrt neuronal activity during stress in both the day and night time. (iii) Radioimmunoassay was used to determine the release of the Hcrt peptide into the CSF during stress. The lesions reduced the cardiovascular and behavioural response to contextual fear but did not affect the response to restraint. Similarly, the activity of Hcrt neurons and the release of the Hcrt peptide were greater after contextual fear than after restraint. These results suggest that Hcrt neurons are involved in specific forms of stress, which are likely to include stressors that are purely psychological (contextual fear) rather than stressors that have an additional physical component (restraint). Most importantly it was also shown that Hcrt???s involvement was not determined by the degree of stress, as increased stress did not result in more Hcrt neuronal activity or Hcrt peptide release than exploratory activity in a non-feared context. This was demonstrated during both day and night when baseline Hcrt and arousal levels were low and high, respectively. It is proposed that Hcrt contributes to the increased attention and arousal that is required to interact with the environment during some stressful and non-stressful conditions. Importantly, this idea integrates the many previously proposed but poorly linked functions of Hcrt.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of p53 in the drug resistance phenotype of childhood neuroblastoma</field><field name="creator">Xue, Chengyuan, School of Women?s &amp; Children?s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is the main obstacle to the successful treatment of many cancers, including childhood neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumour of infants. One factor that may play a role in determining response of neuroblastoma tumours to therapeutic agents is the p53 tumour suppressor gene. A number of previous studies have suggested that this tumour suppressor protein is inactive in neuroblastoma due to its cytoplasmic sequestration. This thesis therefore has examined the functionality of p53 and its role in determining drug response of neuroblastoma cells. An initial study was undertaken that characterised an unusually broad multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype of a neuroblastoma cell line (IMR/KAT100). The results demonstrated that the MDR phenotype of the IMR/KAT100 cells was associated with the acquisition of mutant p53. To explore the role of p53 in drug resistance further, p53-deficient variants in cell lines with wild-type p53 were generated by transduction of p53-suppressive constructs encoding either shRNA or a dominant-negative p53 mutant. Analysis of these cells indicated that: (i) in contrast to previous reports, wild-type p53 was fully functional in all neuroblastoma lines tested, as evidenced by its activation and nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage, transactivation of target genes and control of cell cycle checkpoints; (ii) inactivation of p53 in neuroblastoma cells resulted in establishment of an MDR phenotype; (iii) knockdown of mutant p53 did not revert the drug resistance phenotype, suggesting it is determined by loss of wild-type function rather than gain of mutant function; (iv) p53-dependent cell senescence, the primary response of S-type neuroblastoma cells to DNA damage, is replaced, after p53 inactivation, by mitotic catastrophe and subsequent apoptosis. In contrast to neuroblastoma, p53 suppression had no effect or increased drug susceptibility in several other tumour cell types, indicating the importance of tissue context for p53- mediated modulation of tumour cell sensitivity to treatment. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence for p53 having a role in mediating drug resistance in neuroblastoma and suggest that p53 status may be an important prognostic marker of treatment response in this disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuroblastoma -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Drug resistance in cancer cells.</field><field name="subject">Multidrug resistance.</field><field name="subject">p53 antioncogene.</field><field name="subject">Tumors in children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetics and mechanism of various iron transformations in natural waters at circumneutral pH.</field><field name="creator">Pham, An Ninh, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the implementation and results of studies into the effect of pH on the kinetics of various iron transformations in natural waters are described. Specific studies include i) the oxidation of Fe(II) in the absence and presence of both model and natural organic ligands,  ii) the complexation of Fe(III) by model organic  compounds, and iii) the precipitation of Fe(III) through the use of both laboratory investigations of iron species and kinetic modeling.  In the absence of organic ligands, oxidation of nanomolar concentrations of Fe(II) over the pH range 6.0 -- 8.0 is predominantly controlled by the reaction of Fe(II) with oxygen and with superoxide while the disproportionation of superoxide appears to be negligible. Oxidation of Fe(II) by hydrogen peroxide, back reduction of Fe(III) by superoxide and precipitation of Fe(III) have been shown to exert some influences at various stages of the oxidation at different pH and initial Fe(II) concentrations. In the presence of organic ligands, different effects on the Fe(II) oxidation kinetics is shown with different organic ligands, their initial concentrations and with varying pH. A detailed kinetic model is developed and shown to adequately describe the kinetics of Fe(II) oxidation in the absence and presence of various ligands over a range of concentrations and pH. The applicability of the previous oxidation models to describe the experimental data is assessed.  Rate constants for formation of Fe(III) by a range of model organic compounds over the pH range 6.0 -- 9.5 are determined. Variation of rate constants for Fe(III) complexation by desferrioxamine B and ethylenediaminetetraacetate with varying pH is explained by an outer-sphere complexation model. The significant variation in rate constants of Fe(III) complexation by salicylate,  5-sulfosalicylate, citrate and 3,4-dihydroxylbenzoate with varying pH is possibly due to the presence of different complexes at different pH. The results of this study demonstrate that organic ligands from different sources may influence the speciation of iron in vastly different ways.  The kinetics of Fe(III) precipitation are investigated in bicarbonate solutions over the pH range 6.0 -- 9.5. The rate of precipitation varies by nearly two orders of magnitude with a maximum rate constant at a pH of around 8.0. The results of the study support the existence of the dissolved neutral species Fe(OH)30 and suggests that it is the dominant precursor in Fe(III) polymerization and subsequent precipitation at circumneutral pH. Variation in the precipitation rate constant over the pH range considered is consistent with a mechanism in which the kinetics of iron precipitation are controlled by rates of water exchange in dissolved iron hydrolysis species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Iron oxides.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Purification -- Iron removal.</field><field name="subject">Fresh water.</field><field name="subject">Water quality.</field><field name="subject">Iron bacteria.</field><field name="subject">Water chemistry.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and reactivity of some activated heterocyclic compounds</field><field name="creator">Alamgir, Mahiuddin, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An alternate approach to the synthesis of calix[3]indoles has been demonstrated, but further attempted synthetic approaches to calixindoles using new leaving groups led to uncharacterized polymeric products. The synthesis of new 7,7'-diindolylmethane- 2,2'-dicarbaldehydes gives potential for further ligand design and metal complex formation. In addition, 4,6-dimethoxyindole-7- carbaldehydes have been effectively converted to a range of 6-methoxyindole-4,7-diones by Dakin oxidation.  Various electrophilic substitution reactions have been performed on the 4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles. Formylation, acylation, acid catalyzed addition of formaldehyde and nitration revealed that the activated benzimidazoles are less reactive at the specified C-7 position compared to the analogous indoles. The key starting material for a potential calixbenzimidazole was synthesized by the selenium dioxide oxidation of 2-methyl-7-formyl-4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazole and by oxidative cleavage of 4,6-dimethoxy- 2-styrylbenzimidazole by Lemieux-Johnson reagent followed by reduction. Nevertheless, attempted preparation of calixbenzimidazole from 2-hydroxymethyl-4,6-dimethoxy benzimidazole led to formation of a dibenzimidazolyl ether. The synthesis of some novel activated bisbenzimidazoles has been developed. Furthermore, benzimidazoles were incorporated into new ligand systems which have led to a wide range of acyclic quadridentate neutral metal complexes.  Activated benzimidazoles overall illustrate one electron irreversible oxidation to form a radical cation followed by multielectron oxidations. On the other hand, the nickelII and cobaltII benzimidazole metal complexes investigated showed one electron ligand centered reversible reduction. Irreversible radical cation oxidation followed by multielectron oxidation of the metal complexes further demonstrates the rich electrochemical nature of the 4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles.  Some novel 7-(indol-2-yl)-4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles were prepared with indolin-2-one and triflic anhydride and an alternate procedure afforded 2-(4,6-dimethoxyindol-7-yl)-benzimidazoles from activated indoles and 2-benzimidazolinone.  Two new isomeric series of 2-substituted-5,7-dimethoxybenzothiazoles and 2-substituted-4,6-dimethoxybenzothiazoles were synthesized via Jacobson cyclization.

The philosophy rhetoric controversy of modern dialectics (or argumentation theory) is reducible to a persuasion-knowledge gap. It's addressed in five parts. First, disputes in discourse (dialectics). Critical discussion or debate involves disagreement and contention. An agent's position on an issue includes an opinion (or claim) and ground. A ground is strategically developed in a contest of strengths using psycho-social influence and persuasion. This depends on the conveyance of meaning. Dispute resolution occurs where there is preponderance and a dominant position. The remaining parts selectively elaborate this framework. Second, persuasion (rhetoric). Persuasion involves the use of appeals e.g. rhetorical devices, arguments etc. to influence the propositional attitudes of agents. A hormic-hedonic infrastructure of mind suggests that psycho-social influence occurs through interest-satisfaction and results in an attitude (acceptance-withholding or rejection) toward a proposition. An agents internally operate according to an opinion-persuasion relation with thresholds, which most likely belong to the class of sigmoid functions. Benchmarks (thresholds) are set by a standard of establishment or proof. Satisfying a good standard is a preferred condition for action. Third, reason (dianoetics). Reason is impassioned rationally-principled semi -- autonomous intellect. The hormic-hedonic infrastructure of mind suggests it's  a source (ideas) and an influence (pro-rational passions). Rationality rests on concepts and principles that regulate conduct (thought, feeling and action). Rational discourse isn't fully understood game-theoretically. A  jurisprudential metaphor offers proof-based decision-making as an  approach. Fourth, conduct (strategics). The aim of dispute involves both persuasion and dominance in a contest of strength. Arguments are an important class of appeals; they have cogency as their strength attribute. Strategically, conduct involves argumentative strategic criticism. A universal argumentation scheme describes conduct generally and is the basis for strength aggregates. Ideally, dispute resolution occurs when one position satisfies the standard of establishment or proof. Game-theoretically, establishment- or proof-based decision-making involves scores, voting and Arrow's theorem. Fifth, the dialectics of alethic inquiry (epistemics). This is the application of dialectics to claims. Internally, they are beliefs or knowledge. Difficulties (e.g. the Gettier challenge) with the standard justified true belief (JTB) model leads to alternatives like cognitivism, gradualism and thresholdism. What is proposed is an open contested certified true belief model that makes use of a claim-persuasion relation with thresholds. It is underwritten by a progressive rational regimentation of influences that is naturally based on a common ground of pragmatic reliabilism. This requires a preference for persuasive over non-persuasive influences. Thus, knowledge  is belief with proof where proof-based decision-making rests on the cogency of arguments and case. Finally, by bridging the persuasion-knowledge gap, the philosophy-rhetoric controversy is settled and a reconciliation of philosophy (representing dialectics) and rhetoric is achieved. Rhetoric is a sub-discipline of dialectics. An implication is a denial of the incommensurability of theories associated with critical discussion and debate in discourse.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Persuasion (Rhetoric)</field><field name="subject">Philosophy.</field><field name="subject">Rhetoric.</field><field name="subject">Dialectic.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">My truth: women speak cancer</field><field name="creator">Housel, Rebecca Anne, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">1) My Truth: Women Speak Cancer is a creative nonfiction based on three years of interviews with twelve survivors told through the lens of the author's experience as a three-time, sixteen-year survivor of multiple cancers.

Of the nine new, targeted molecules produced for this work, seven formed inclusion compounds, and their solid-state structures are discussed herein.  Chapter 2 shows the effect that substituting a hydrogen atom with a chlorine atom has on the inclusion properties. This comes about because of the additional intermolecular attractions that are now possible, and a wider range of guest molecules is included as a result. A new homochiral aromatic 'swivel offset face-face (OFF)' interaction is observed.  Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the effect of adding extra aromatic planes to the target molecules, two or four planes, respectively. Each of these host molecules formed dimeric host-host units that are extremely similar across all crystal structures. These dimers mainly employed aromatic edgeface (EF) interactions.  Chapter 5 looks at the effect of combining the modifications described in Chapters 2-4, namely additional aromatic surfaces and atom substitution. The resulting host molecule specifically includes polyhalomethane guests. In addition, this host molecule formed two concomitant pseudo-dimorph compounds with chloroform-d.  The diquinoline host molecule presented in Chapter 6 incorporated an isomeric central linker ring to the other compounds. Although only a single crystal structure could be obtained, 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments show other small aromatics may be included.  The effect of electron donating chemical substituents was examined in Chapter 7. These compounds were found to be quite insoluble, and did not produce crystals suitable for X-ray analysis.  The host molecules in Chapter 8 contain electron withdrawing nitro groups. The two isomeric compounds that act as inclusion hosts show quite different properties. One of these hosts forms a series of inclusion compounds with water, in which the site occupancy of the guest can range from 0-100% without change to the overall structure. All the X-ray structures described have been analysed in crystal engineering terms, and their supramolecular interactions described in detail.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clathrate compounds.</field><field name="subject">Organic compounds -- Synthesis.</field><field name="subject">Halogen.</field><field name="subject">Molecules structure.</field><field name="subject">Crystals -- Structure.</field><field name="subject">Quinoline</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of bearing failure in pin-loaded laminates</field><field name="creator">Ujjin, Rapee, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of an investigation of bearing failure at a loaded hole in carbon fibre composite laminates. The investigation included finite element analysis and a program of experimental testing for quasi-isotropic laminates, uni-directional laminates and laminates with fibres steered along predefined trajectories. The investigation formed part of a research program in the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures Ltd (CRC-ACS) support by the Office of Naval Research from the United States. Work in progress in the CRC includes research defined in this thesis including the addition of nano-particles to the resin to improve the bearing strength. The literature survey undertaken in this thesis identified that the micro-buckling theory proposed by Professor C.T. Sun from Purdue University, Indiana USA, is the best analysis procedure for initial bearing failure in pin-loaded laminates. This failure theory has therefore been implemented in a Fortran program using the results from a finite element analysis for the nonlinear contact problem of a pin bearing on a hole in a composite laminate. The finite element analysis is executed using the commercial finite element system MSC.MARC. The numerical predictions have been validated by a test of progressive failure with the aid of an acoustic emission monitoring system. The acoustic emission parametric and frequency analysis is performed using the acoustic emission software Vallen Systeme. Fast fourier transformation of the waveform have been achieved to distinguish and identify microfailure mode. Failure mechanisms have been verified by post-mortem microstructural examination. There are 3 failure mechanisms associated with bearing failure in carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite, the first is fibre matrix interfacial failure, followed by fibre fracture, and subsequently matrix splitting.

The case study aims to identify factors which influence the response of the hospital to patient complaints and whether it incorporates information derived from patient complaints in its quality improvement efforts.  The study was conducted in two stages. The first stage was a cross-institutional comparison of quality management systems between a hospital in Britain and a hospital in Taiwan. The study explored how these hospitals managed patient complaints and whether they took such feedback into account in reviewing priority of services. The second stage included a detailed case study of the hospital in Taiwan (the Case Hospital), exploring the hospital???s responses to patient complaints, along with the factors which may have influenced these responses.  The study was designed to triangulate data through the use of a multi-method approach to derive converging or diverging empirical evidence from a variety of data sources. Data were obtained through interviews with hospital senior managers, a senior social worker, government officials, and managers of non-government organisations. A questionnaire survey was administered to managers, and the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), along with observation, was applied, as well as analysis of documents. Principally, this study adopts the techniques of thematic analysis (Lincoln and Guba, 1985a) with an interpretivist approach to analyse the empirical data.  The results of the study indicate that although the Case Hospital appeared to be concerned about patients??? complaints, it did not respond in a systematic way to the messages received. Hospital managers appeared to merely attempt to pacify complainants while ignoring the underlying causes of their complaints. It was evident that there were no protocols in place as to how staff should handle complaints, and as a result, the hospital was failing to use the information about systemic problems provided by patient complaints to make any sustainable quality improvement. In other words, whilst the Case Hospital was attempting to resolve patient complaints on a case-by-case basis (doing things right for the patient, or in the terms of Argyris (1990), using ???single-loop??? learning), it was not reviewing or acting on these complaints as a collective group to identify systemic problems and deficiencies (doing right things, i.e. ???double-loop??? learning).  The study found that the organisational response to complaints was influenced by features of the complaints and institutional attributes. Features of complaints affected the response pathways to complaints, such as patients??? status, the severity of complaints, and the nature of complaints. In terms of systemic features, the organisational response to complaints was influenced by the interaction between managerial factors (e.g. organisational structure and organisational culture), operational factors (e.g. documentation and communication), and technical factors (e.g. complaints handling techniques and information systems). The values of the top hospital management have been recognised as a powerful influence on these factors. Generally, results show that although the Case Hospital tends to take action to address individual complainants, there was no evidence of sustainable quality improvement within the organisation as a result of complaints data.  The study recommends that if the hospital intends to use patient complaints to improve quality of clinical care, a ???double-loop??? learning strategy should be adopted within the organisation. This study also argues that governments need to take more responsibility and demand more accountability from hospitals, in terms of complaints handling. The individual hospital would thus be able to respond to patient complaints in a systemic way. Hospitals need to be more accountable when using patient complaints to drive quality improvement in the future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patient complaints</field><field name="subject">quality improvement</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">complaints (administrative procedures)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced protein wasting and potential treatment with anabolic hormoness</field><field name="creator">Burt, Morton Garth, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Protein wasting is a complication of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. It causes substantial morbidity and there is no treatment. This thesis investigates the metabolic mechanisms underlying GC-induced protein wasting and the potential for anabolic hormones to reverse protein loss. The models of GC excess were Cushing's syndrome and GC therapy. Whole body protein metabolism was assessed using the leucine turnover technique and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to estimate lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM).  As previous studies demonstrated that LBM and FM influenced rates of protein metabolism, the magnitude of body compositional abnormality in Cushing's syndrome was determined. After accounting for the greater FM (30%) and lesser LBM (15%), protein metabolism in Cushing's syndrome was characterised by a significant increase in protein oxidation, an abnormality that leads to irreversible protein loss. Successful treatment of Cushing's syndrome normalised protein oxidation.  Studies of the acute and chronic effects of therapeutic GCs revealed a time-dependent effect on protein metabolism. GCs acutely increased protein oxidation. However, the rate of protein oxidation during chronic therapy at a similar dose was not significantly different to untreated control subjects. This time-dependent change suggests that GC-induced stimulation of protein oxidation does not persist and could represent a metabolic adaptation to limit protein loss. This finding contrasts with that in Cushing's syndrome, where protein oxidation is persistently elevated. This difference may represent a dose effect.  Studies in GH-deficient subjects revealed that GH induced a fall in protein oxidation that was significantly correlated with a subsequent gain in LBM. This suggests that the anabolic potential of a therapeutic substance can be predicted by its ability to suppress protein oxidation acutely.  Finally, the potential for GH and androgens to reverse the metabolic effects of GCs was assessed. A preliminary study in GC users revealed that a GH dose of 0.8 mg/d was effective in reducing protein oxidation. In a subsequent study, the GH-induced reduction in protein oxidation in women on GCs was enhanced by combined treatment with dehydroepiandrosterone, an androgen.  In summary, GCs induce protein loss by stimulating protein oxidation. GH reverses this effect and this action is enhanced by coadministration of androgens. GH and androgens may be used therapeutically to prevent protein loss induced by GCs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glucocorticoids -- Therapeutic use.</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Metabolism.</field><field name="subject">Body composition.</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Oxidation.</field><field name="subject">Cushing's syndrome -- Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The treatment engagement model as a tool for identifying problematic doctor behaviour. Three case studies.</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Judith Ronelle, Graduate Program in Professional Ethics, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of professional behaviour in health care settings, using a Model of Treatment Engagement that is developed as a tool for ethics critique. The Model is tested and refined using data on: a psychiatric ???treatment??? carried out on over 1,127 occasions in a 15 - 40 bed non-acute hospital during the period 1961-1979; the problematic withdrawal of all life-support from a 37 year old man who had suffered acute brain trauma some five days previously, in a tertiary hospital in March 2000; and a clinical experiment recently proposed for the emergency setting and intended to encompass five hospitals and the NSW Ambulance Service. In each case, the Model proves useful in identifying the shift from the treatment paradigm and the ethical imperative of ensuring the patient (or his/her agent) appreciates the difference between what is proposed and what would normally be done. It reveals how doctors who dealt with the patient but did not decide on treatment contributed to ethically troublesome practice. It clarifies how having multiple doctor players in the treatment situation gave rise to the need to suppress dissenting views.  Doctors who were close enough to the action to comprehend its nature, by not dissenting, reinforced the problematic choice for the actor and validated it in the eyes of observers. The lack of dissent at the level of doctors working under supervision, appeared to be a function of institutional arrangements. At the consultant level, there was evidence of pressure to concur from other consultants and indirect evidence of a fear of ostracism. The public responses in the two modern cases point to there being a strong idea in Sydney???s medical community that dissent should not be publicly displayed once a decision on how to treat has been made.  I conclude there are two steps to reviewing ethically problematic treatment situations. The first consists of identifying the shift from the treatment paradigm. The second consists of establishing why the problematic choice is translated into action. The Treatment Engagement Model is put forward as a useful tool for both these analyses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consent</field><field name="subject">clinical trials</field><field name="subject">treatment engagement model</field><field name="subject">problematic doctor behaviour</field><field name="subject">medical ethics</field><field name="subject">analytic tool</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proddy-dogs, cattleticks and ecumaniacs: aspects of sectarianism in New South Wales, 1945-1981</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Benjamin, History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies sectarianism in New South Wales from 1947 through to 1981. This was a period of intense change in Australian socio-cultural history, as well as in the history of religious cultures, both within Australia and internationally. Sectarianism, traditionally a significant force in Australian socio-cultural life, was significantly affected by the many changes of this period: the religious revival of the 1950s, the rise of ecumenism and the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, as well as postwar mass-immigration, the politics of education, increasing secularism in Australian society and the Goulburn schools closure of 1962, which was both a symptom of the diminishing significance of sectarianism as well as a force that accelerated its demise.   While the main study of sectarianism in this thesis ends with the 1981 High Court judgment upholding the constitutionality of state aid to non-government schools, this thesis also traces the lingering significance of sectarianism in Australian society through to the early twenty-first century through oral history and memoir. This thesis offers a contribution to historical understanding of sectarianism, examining the significance of sectarianism as a discursive force in Australian society in the context of social, political and religious cultures of the period.  It argues that while the significant social and religious changes of the period eroded the discursive power of sectarianism in Australian society, this does not mean sectarianism simply vanished from Australian society. While sectarianism became increasingly insignificant in mainstream Australian socio-political life in this period, sectarianism -- both as a discourse and ideology -- lingered in social memory and in some religious cultures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Church -- Relations -- Protestant churches -- History -- 20th century -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Church and state -- History -- 20th century -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Religion and politics -- New South Wales -- 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Protestants -- 20th century -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Catholics -- New South Wales -- 20th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of inverted wings with endplates in ground effect</field><field name="creator">Ricapito, David, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An inverted wing with various endplate configurations was investigated at two different angles of incidence.

The PBS access scheme for the anti-rheumatic biologicals (etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) was examined for concordance with Australia?s National Medicines Policy. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with a range of stakeholders were conducted. National, aggregated prescription and expenditure data from Medicare Australia and dispensing data from the Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee were analysed. Access to biologicals was also examined from an ethical perspective.  Results: Interviewees agreed that controlled access to high-cost medicines was broadly equitable and practical but specific concerns included: timeliness of access; bureaucracy of the process; contentious cases of individual patients being denied access; insufficient patient information; the quantum of resources required to administer the access scheme; inadequate stakeholder consultation. The access requirement of a history of failure of conventional anti-rheumatic drugs was supported. Recommendations included proactive review of the access criteria and outcomes; greater transparency and formal stakeholder involvement to increase public confidence in the definition of &amp;quot target patient population" and a formal appeal mechanism to increase the fairness and accountability of the PBS. Establishment of an appeal mechanism is supported by &amp;quot accountability for reasonableness&amp;quot framework grounded in procedural justice. Data needed to examine the health outcomes associated with the use of biologicals on a national level was not easily available. This shortcoming is discordant with National Medicines Policy. Utilisation of biologicals over the first two years of PBS-subsidy was conservative but with considerable variability across States and Territories (an 8-fold difference between the jurisdictions), usage roughly correlating with access to rheumatologists. Introduction of PBS-subsidised biologicals did not alter the trends in utilisation of non-biological anti-rheumatic drugs. Conclusions: This research suggests that policy-makers focus upon: explicitly considering ethical principles and formally involving stakeholders when developing policies on access to high-cost medicines; improving communication and providing information based on increased transparency; and establishing formal mechanisms for review of and appeals against PBS decisions. The comprehensive evaluation of medicine use and outcomes post-subsidy is critical for the future of the PBS. The National Medicines Policy has proved a useful framework for evaluating this access scheme.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Drugs -- Costs -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evidence on short and long run returns for equity offerings on the stock exchange of Thailand</field><field name="creator">Pamornmast, Chayongkan, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two important findings in the IPO literature, IPO's underpricing and poor long run stock returns, are investigated by using the sample of IPOs completed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) from 1994 to 1999. The evidence suggests that Thai IPOs are underpriced and have poor long run stock returns. Rock 's (1986) model is employed to explain the underpricing of Thai IPOs. Rock's model is supported by the evidence of Thai IPOs. 	Past market conditions and the stock liquidity of the IPOs' industries are the main factors which affect investor demand for IPO shares. IPOs which go public in the hot market conditions (periods with high past market return) and IPOs which come from liquid industries (industries which have high stock turnover) attract more investor demand. These two factors are also positively correlated with IPO first day return. This suggests that investors have higher demand for IPOs which go public in the hot market conditions and IPOs which come from liquid industries because these IPOs are underpriced, and the underpricing of these IPOs is corrected during the first trading day.	IPOs with low investor demand underperform their benchmarks in the long run. On the contrary, the long run returns of IPOs with high investor demand are not significantly different from their benchmarks. One possible explanation for the underperformance of IPOs with low investor demand is that these IPOs may be illiquid. The lack of demand during the first trading day may cause their first closing price to be different from their intrinsic value. This difference is gradually adjusted in the long run leading to the underperformance of these IPOs. This hypothesis is supported by the evidence. The sample of rights offerings announced in the SET between 1994 and 1999 also supports the role of liquidity in explaining the poor long run performance of issuers. 	The change in operating performance of IPOs from the IPO-year to the post-IPO years also has some power in explaining the long run underperformance of IPOs. IPOs which perform more badly after going public have poor long run returns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IPO.</field><field name="subject">SEO.</field><field name="subject">Stock exchanges -- Thailand.</field><field name="subject">Equity offering.</field><field name="subject">Stock prices.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitric oxide-mediated differentiation and dispersal in bacterial biofilms</field><field name="creator">Barraud, Nicolas, School of Biotechnology And Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In nature bacteria predominantly live on surfaces, in matrix-encased communities called biofilms. Biofilm formation displays dynamic developmental patterns resembling those of multicellular organisms. Using cooperative traits such as cell-cell signaling, bacteria in biofilms form complex architectures, known as microcolonies, in which cells become highly differentiated from their planktonic counterparts. Microcolonies are generally highly tolerant to bactericides, rendering biofilms extremely difficult to eradicate. The aim of this study was to investigate the last, and least understood stage of biofilm development, which involves the coordinated dispersal of single cells that revert to a free-swimming planktonic phenotype and escape from the biofilm. Strategies to induce biofilm dispersal are of interest due to their potential to prevent biofilms and biofilm-related infections.  In the model organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa, reproducible patterns of cell death and dispersal can occur within biofilm structures, leaving behind empty or hollow microcolonies. These events were previously linked with the appearance of oxidative and/or nitrosative stress in mature microcolonies. Here, the involvement of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates in biofilm development and dispersal processes was investigated in both mono- and mixed-species biofilms. By using specific fluorescent dyes and P. aeruginosa mutant strains, nitric oxide (NO), a by-product of anaerobic respiration and an important messenger molecule in biological systems, was found to play a major role in P. aeruginosa biofilm dispersal. Further, the results demonstrated that exposure to physiological, non-toxic concentrations of NO (in the low nanomolar range) causes biofilm dispersal in P. aeruginosa and restores its vulnerability to conventional antimicrobials. By using microarray techniques, NO was shown to induce global changes in genetic expression, including enhanced metabolic activity and motility and decreased adhesion and virulence in P. aeruginosa biofilms. The regulatory pathway implicated c-di-GMP, a newly discovered messenger molecule involved in the transition from sessility to motility in many bacterial species. NO-mediated dispersal was also observed in other single- and multi-species biofilms of clinically and industrially relevant organisms. Hence, the combined exposure to NO and bactericides was identified as a potential novel strategy for the removal of microbial communities, providing a low cost and environmentally safe solution to biofilm control.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biofilms.</field><field name="subject">Differentiation.</field><field name="subject">Dispersal.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</field><field name="subject">Pseudomonas -- Genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Term structure modelling and the dynamics of Australian interest rates</field><field name="creator">O???Brien, Peter, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two related parts. In the first part we conduct an empirical examination of the dynamics of Australian interest rates of six different maturities, covering the whole yield curve. This direct study of the long rates is quite novel. We use maximum likelihood estimation on a variety of models and find some results that are in stark contrast to previous studies. We estimate Poisson-jump diffusion (PJD) models and find very strong evidence for the existence of jumps in all daily interest rate series. We find that the PJD model fits short-rate data significantly better than a Bernoulli-jump diffusion model. We also estimate the CKLS model for our data and find that the only model not rejected for all six maturities is the CEV model in stark contrast to previous findings. Also, we find that the elasticity of variance estimate in the CKLS model is much higher for the short-rates than for the longer rates where the estimate is only about 0.25, indicating that different dynamics seem to be at work for different maturities. We also found that adding jumps to the simple diffusion model gives a larger improvement than comes from going from the simple diffusion to the CKLS model. In the second part of the thesis we examine the Flesaker and Hughston (FH) term structure model. We derive the dynamics of the short rate under both the original measure and the risk-neutral measure, and show that some criticisms of the bounds for the short rate may not be significant in actual applications. We also derive the dynamics of bond prices in the FH model and compare them to the HJM model. We also extend the FH model by allowing the martingale to follow a jump-diffusion process, rather than just a diffusion process. We derive the unique change of measure that guarantees the family of bond prices is arbitrage-free. We derive prices for caps and swaptions, and extend the results to include Bermudan swaptions and show how to price options with the jump-diffusion version of the FH model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interest rate models -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Interest rates -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Actin and its regulating proteins in drug response</field><field name="creator">Po???uha, Sela Tu???ipulotu, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Antimicrotubule drugs are used in the treatment of childhood neuroblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Resistance to these agents can be a major clinical problem and mechanisms mediating resistance are not fully understood. Previous studies have reported an association between the actin cytoskeleton and resistance to antimicrotubule drugs. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the actin regulating proteins, LIM kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2) in drug resistance. In addition, the role of ?? actin, a major actin isoform, in drug resistance was also examined. Chapter 1 reviewed the known mechanisms of antimicrotubule drug resistance and the interaction between the microtubules and actin cytoskeleton. The methodologies used in this study are described in chapter 2. LIMKs are known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton via phosphorylation of cofilin. Real Time RT PCR and western blotting was used in chapter 3 and showed that expression of LIMKs and their downstream target cofilin was altered in antimicrotubule resistant neuroblastoma and leukaemia cells. Moreover, altered LIMK expression was detected in in vivo derived vincristine resistant ALL xenografts and ALL clinical samples, further demonstrating that alterations in LIMKs and cofilin are associated with antimicrotubule drug resistance. Importantly, in chapter 4, gene silencing and drug treated clonogenic assays were performed to elucidate the functional role of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in drug response. Silencing of LIMK1 and/or LIMK2 increased sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to microtubule targeting drugs and DNA damaging agents, suggesting that LIMKs may be useful targets to improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs. ??-Actin has been associated with drug resistance and chapter 5 used gene silencing and drug treated clonogenic assays to show that decreased ?? actin expression conferred resistance to anitmicrotubule drugs but not to DNA damaging agents. Microscopy and tubulin polymerisation assays showed that reduced ??-actin protects microtubules from paclitaxel induced polymerisation. This data supports a functional role for ?? actin in antimicrotubule drug action. In conclusion, this study showed that LIMKs and ?? actin mediate the action of antimicrotubule drugs and other anticancer agents, demonstrating that the actin cytoskeleton may serve as a useful drug target to improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance in cancer cells</field><field name="subject">Actin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient computation of advanced skyline queries.</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Yidong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for many applications, such as multi-criteria decision making, data mining and visualization, and user-preference queries.  Due to its importance, skyline and its computation have received considerable attention from database research community recently. All the existing techniques, however, focus on the conventional databases. They are not applicable to online computation environment, such as data stream. In addition, the existing studies consider efficiency of skyline computation only, while the fundamental problem on the semantics of skylines still remains open. In this thesis, we study three problems of skyline computation: (1) online computing skyline over data stream; (2) skyline cube computation and its analysis; and (3) top-k most representative skyline. To tackle the problem of online skyline computation, we develop a novel framework which converts more expensive multiple dimensional skyline computation to stabbing queries in 1-dimensional space.  Based on this framework, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the time complexity of online skyline computation is provided. Then, efficient algorithms are proposed to support ad hoc and continuous skyline queries over data stream. Inspired by the idea of data cube, we propose a novel concept of skyline cube which consists of skylines of all possible non-empty subsets of a given full space.  We identify the unique sharing strategies for skyline cube computation and develop two efficient algorithms which compute skyline cube in a bottom-up and top-down manner, respectively.  Finally, a theoretical framework to answer the question about semantics of skyline and analysis of multidimensional subspace skyline are presented. Motived by the fact that the full skyline may be less informative because it generally consists of a large number of skyline points, we proposed a novel skyline operator -- top-k most representative skyline. The top-k most representative skyline operator selects the k skyline points so that the number of data points, which are dominated by at least one of these k skyline points, is maximized.  To compute top-k most representative skyline, two efficient algorithms and their theoretical analysis are presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Database management.</field><field name="subject">Database design.</field><field name="subject">Question-answering systems.</field><field name="subject">Natural language processing (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Semantics - Data processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability and participation in the governing of water use: the case of water recycling</field><field name="creator">Stenekes, Nyree, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Urban water recycling has been promoted as one of several ways that water use efficiency could be improved in Australia???s cities, but few such schemes have been introduced. Many urban water-recycling schemes have been proposed, but often, these projects have been rejected because of community opposition. These difficulties suggest that recycling water is not just about having the right answer to any problem, but about the way in which the question is addressed. It is concerned with how practice is institutionalised; not just the rule making, but also the understandings and values that make the rule-making possible. In this thesis, the question of how the system of water governance could be strengthened to encourage sustainable water use through water recycling is examined. An analysis of experiences in three Australian case studies is conducted, in which recycled water was proposed for sustainability, to illuminate the way in which water use is institutionalised. Particular attention is given to the construction of meaning in relation to water use, by considering how water problems are framed and negotiated by different stakeholders and groups and the significance of the multiplicity of interpretive frameworks in use for the institutionalisation of practice. The analysis draws on institutional organisational theory and interpretive methods, which regard interpretation as one element (cognitive) in the stabilisation of social practice and closely linked to organisation (regulative) and values (normative). The study findings suggest meaning was a very important part of institutional change. Participants tended to construct policy issues as they became involved by drawing on different interpretive frameworks embodying different values and expectations. These interpretations reflected the organisational structuring of practice, such that the position/role in the organisational field reflected an actor???s interpretation of problems and/or solutions. Outcomes of the study suggest that institutionalising change in water management is problematic and depends on changes in the regulative, normative and cognitive dimensions of practice, as part of a continuous feedback loop between interpretation and practice. This view of change contrasts with existing research, which tends to see the problem in terms of influencing attitudes of specific groups and assumes preferences precede the action.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water reuse</field><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="subject">Water resources development</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brownian motion and heat kernels on compact lie groups and symmetric spaces.</field><field name="creator">Maher, David Graham, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">An important object of study in harmonic analysis is the heat equation.

It provides an account of Societas Raffaello Sanzio???s history, working methods, a detailed reading of the thematic and philosophical landscape in their works especially Genesi: from the museum of sleep, and the cycle: Tragedia Endogonidia, and a discussion on the company???s artistic process towards the formation of its compositions and performances. This research and investigation is based on numerous viewings of most of the company???s theatre works created in the last six years, interviews with Romeo Castellucci as well as other participating artists, two privileged periods of observation (residencies) in Italy of the rehearsal and creation processes of three shows, and the analysis and discussion of some of the key critical and intellectual responses to the work of Romeo Castellucci. The thematic focus of the thesis is the notion of Origins and Destinations, and its relationship with the language of representation in Romeo Castellucci???s theatre. The theoretical discussion in the thesis is organised around Giorgio Agamben???s notion of Potentiality within the composition and content of Castellucci???s theatre. This concept provides a link between the key ideas of Origins, Destinations and Representation. Castellucci???s application of Agamben???s Potentiality deconstructs dramatic structure, narrative and action down to the fundamentals of the act itself, separated from its meaningful context. It is the conclusion of this thesis, that in the instant of this singular act, Romeo Castellucci manages to represent a point where origin and destination meet, or a point where they both are, for an instant, one and the same thing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An agent-based approach to dialogue management in personal assistants</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thi Thuc Anh, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Personal assistants need to allow the user to interact with the system in a flexible and adaptive way such as through spoken language dialogue.

The user-system interaction is handled by a Dialogue Manager agent.  We propose an agent-based approach that makes use of a BDI agent architecture for dialogue modelling and control. The Dialogue Manager agent of the SPA acts as the central point for maintaining coherent user-system interaction and coordinating the activities of the assistants. The dialogue model consists of a set of complex but modular plans for handling communicative goals. The dialogue control flow emerges automatically as the result of the agent???s plan selection by the BDI interpreter. In addition the Dialogue Manager maintains the conversational context, the domainspecific knowledge and the user model in its internal beliefs.  We also consider the problem of dialogue adaptation in such agent-based dialogue systems. We present a novel way of integrating learning into a BDI architecture so that the agent can learn to select the most suitable plan among those applicable in the current context. This enables the Dialogue Manager agent to tailor its responses according to the conversational context and the user???s physical context, devices and preferences.  Finally, we report the evaluation results, which indicate the robustness and effectiveness of the dialogue model in handling a range of users.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spoken dialogues</field><field name="subject">dialogue management</field><field name="subject">BDI agents</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">natural language processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to control</field><field name="creator">Potts, Duncan, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines whether it is possible for a machine to incrementally build a complex model of its environment, and then use this model for control purposes. Given a sequence of noisy observations, the machine forms a piecewise linear approximation to the nonlinear dynamic equations that are assumed to describe the real world. A number of existing online system identification techniques are examined, but it is found that they all either scale poorly with dimensionality, have a number of parameters that make them difficult to apply, or do not learn sufficiently accurate approximations.  Therefore a novel framework is developed for learning linear model trees in both batch and online settings. The algorithms are evaluated empirically on a number of commonly used benchmark datasets, a simple test function, and three dynamic domains ranging from a simple pendulum to a complex flight simulator. The new batch algorithm is compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms and is seen to perform favourably overall. The new incremental model tree learner also compares well with a recent online function approximator from the literature.  Armed with a tool for effectively constructing piecewise linear models of the environment, a control framework is developed that learns trajectories from a demonstrator and attempts to follow these trajectories within each linear region usinglinear quadratic control. The induced controllers are able to swing up and balance a simple forced pendulum both in simulation and in the real world. They can also swing up and balance a real double pendulum. The induced controllers are empirically shown to perform better than the original demonstrator, and could therefore be used to either replace a human operator or improve upon an existing automatic controller. In addition an ability to generalise the learnt trajectories enables the system to perform novel tasks. This is demonstrated on a flight simulator where, having observed an aircraft flying several times around a circuit, the controller is able to copy the take-off procedure, fly a completely new circuit that includes new manoeuvres, and successfully land the plane.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic control.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of secondary lymphoid organs in baff induced autoimmune disease</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Carrie-Anne, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj?gren?s syndrome (SS) are both heterogeneous autoimmune diseases with strong B cell aspects. A proportion of SLE and SS patients exhibit elevated serum BAFF (B cell activating factor of the TNF family); BAFF plays a key role in B cell homeostasis, survival and tolerance. BAFF transgenic (Tg) mice develop nephritis and salivary gland destruction that resemble aspects of SLE and SS respectively. Autoimmune disease development in BAFF Tg mice correlates with marginal zone (MZ) B cell expansion and the abnormal presence of MZ-like B cells outside of the spleen. The role of MZ B cells in BAFF induced autoimmune disease was analysed by crossing BAFF Tg mice with Lymphotoxin-&#946; knockout mice (creating LT&#946;&#61508;-BTg mice) which lack most peripheral lymph nodes, and also lack MZ B cells as a result of disrupted splenic architecture. LT&#946;&#61508;-BTg mice were not protected against nephritis but exhibited reduced salivary gland infiltration and destruction. Indicating that the development of sialadenitis but not nephritis in BAFF Tg mice is MZ B cell dependent. Nephritis development in LT&#946;&#61508;-BTg mice was associated with the detection of B-1 B cells in the inflamed kidneys. As B-1a B cell survival is dependent on the spleen, the contribution of B-1a B cells to nephritis development in BAFF Tg mice was assessed by crossing BAFF Tg mice to congenitally asplenic Hox11-/- mice (creating Hox11 &#61508;-BTg mice). The absence of a spleen and B-1a B cells in Hox11&#61508;-BTg mice delayed the nephritis development. In contrast, splenectomy of BAFF Tg mice at 12 weeks of age did not alter nephritis onset. In these mice B-1a B cells persisted in the peritoneal cavity and MZ-like B cells were detected in the periphery 8 months after surgery. In summary, nephritis development in BAFF Tg mice is unaltered by the absence of MZ B cells, but delayed in the absence of a spleen, MZ and B-1a B cells. Thus, B-1a and B-1b B cells may be potential targets for the treatment of nephritis in SLE patients with elevated BAFF.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autoimmunity.</field><field name="subject">BAFF.</field><field name="subject">MZ B cells.</field><field name="subject">Spleen.</field><field name="subject">B cells.</field><field name="subject">Autoimmune diseases.</field><field name="subject">Autoimmune diseases -- Animal models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40867</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Stand up and give 'em the fright of their life' : a study of intellectual disability and the emergence and practice of self-advocacy</field><field name="creator">Dowse, Leanne Margaret, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Modernising discourses of intellectual disability have brought innovative social technologies that promote participation and freedom for people so labelled. This thesis argues there is a key experiential contradiction between these discourses as operationalised in neo-liberalism and the ways that people with intellectual disability embrace self-advocacy and become political actors in their own right. Through its inherently moral claims, self-advocacy supports the experiential voice of the 'other' and reveals itself as a sustaining and enduring pillar in the struggle against human injustice and inequity. These other discourses, in contrast, intensify individualisation, ignore power relations and depoliticise self-advocacy as a politics of resistance.  The first part of the thesis critically examines the emergence of intellectual disability as a dimension of human difference and examines how forms of knowledge shape social and policy responses to such people. The second part presents a collaborative action research methodology and a reflective study which challenges the bio-medical, positivist and psycho-reductionist styles of research that have objectified people with intellectual disability. Using this methodology, the voices and experiences of two groups of self-advocates, one in England and the other in Australia are interpreted.  Contemporary professional and other governmental interventions demand individual competencies in the pursuit of self-determination. These discourses of empowerment and citizenship are in constant tension with historically conditioned structures which shape the material and social lives of people with intellectual disability. The thesis finds similarities in the ways that self-advocates and their allies interpret these political realities and work within, across and beyond their contradictory trajectories of constraint and freedom.  The study suggests that self-advocacy is a complex and sophisticated practice aimed at recognition of the unique lived experience of intellectual disability and the legitimacy of claims to self-representation. It also operates at a deeper level as an emotional process of transformation. Its powerful recuperative character sustains liberated identities for people with intellectual disability, many of whom have experienced lives of abuse, neglect and mis-recognition. Such practices have the potential to contribute to transforming both the centres of policy-making and power and subaltern selves.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People with mental disabilities.</field><field name="subject">Self-realization.</field><field name="subject">Self-reliance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flame spray synthesis of catalyst nanoparticles for photocatalytic mineralisation of organics and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis</field><field name="creator">Teoh, Wey Yang, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a range of TiO2-based photocatalysts and cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts were developed and synthesised via the one-step Flame Spray Pyrolysis(FSP). The work starts with the demonstration of bare TiO2 nanoparticles synthesis with controlled characteristics such as specific surface areas, crystallite sizes and anatase content. A comparative study was carried out by benchmarking with commercial Degussa P25 TiO2. The FSP TiO2 was shown to be more efficient in mineralising pollutants requiring direct charge transfer such as the saccharides, while P25 was better for mineralising alcoholic and aromatic compounds. Both catalysts were equally as active in mineralising carboxylic acids. Upon identifying the optimal synthesis of bare TiO2, an in situ co-precipitation of highly dispersed Pt on TiO2 was carried out in the flame. Deposition of Pt resulted in enhanced photocatalytic performance as a result of efficient charge trappings. It is highlighted here the inter-relationship between Pt oxidation states and the TiO2photocatalysis of carboxylic acid, alcohol and aromatic compounds. Depending on the mineralisation path adopted by the model organic compounds, they were shown to have direct influence on the Pt oxidation states. These oxidation states in turn affect the mineralisation rates of the organic compounds. Substitutional-doping of TiO2 with Fe(III) with tunable bandgap was also possible by FSP synthesis. The high temperature synthesis coupled with rapid quenching resulted in 5 times higher solubility limit (Fe/Ti = 0.05) than that previously reported in the literature. Under visible light irradiation, FSP-made Fe-TiO2 improved the photocatalytic mineralisation of oxalic acid by more than 6 times, with respect to P25 and FSP TiO2. Furthermore, the photocatalyst was reusable over a number of repetitions with minimal leaching or loss in activity. The last part of the work concerns the development of bare and Ru-doped Co-ZrO2 catalysts, where cobalt was finely dispersed within the zirconia matrix. Doping of Ru enhanced significantly the reducibility of cobalt, reducing even the embedded cobalt beneath the zirconia surface. It also increased the extent of CO-chemisorption and as such, enhanced the FT activity. This is the first time, catalysts of such type is synthesised and tested for FT reaction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flame.</field><field name="subject">Catalysts.</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles.</field><field name="subject">Fischer-Tropsch process.</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated method of vocal development: a theoretical and empirical study</field><field name="creator">Gullaer, Irene, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">The integrated method proposed and worked out consisted of integration of vocal and voice-speech teaching techniques as well as integration of the empirical and mechanical methods of teaching. Balance and co-ordination between external and intra-pharyngeal articulation were considered as a framework for integration of various methods of teaching. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), along with spectral analysis, was used to demonstrate the work of intrapharyngeal muscles while singing and to assess the quality of vocalization. 54 MRI expositions were generated for the set of vowels, pitches and modes, of which over 400 MRI images were synthesized and measured. When switching from amateur to professional way of singing, radical transformations of size, shape and to some extent, changes in the surface properties (density, porosity) of muscular tissue of intra-pharyngeal cavities were observed. New acquired MR images clearly showed that the axial section of the back cavity appears indeed much larger in the professional mode than in the amateur mode. Statistical analysis showed that this difference is statistically significant. It is shown that the work on muscles development and use of mental images/imagination must progress in close collaboration. The strategy for the gradual mastering technique of the opening of the vocal tract was suggested, and developed. A new approach was developed to be applied for students to get stable repeatability when they work with mental images. Obtained MR images were used as a part of visualization method during experimental work with students. MR images helped students to create proper mental images. The theory of tangible images was suggested and then successfully applied in the form of experimental work with students. Experimental work with students of the ethnic group Maori was conducted.  This experimental work with Maori students demonstrated that the integrated method of teaching helped to overcome some physiological and psychological specific problems which require special techniques of training. Case studies were carried out to assess individual and students' group perceptions, along with interview techniques and a survey questionnaire.

However, the overall efficacy of these programs has been compromised by implementation failure and a focus on abstinence based outcomes. The current thesis attempted to overcome such concerns by developing a computer-delivered school-based alcohol prevention program founded on a harm-minimisation approach. The aims of this thesis were to assess whether (1) this program would be both a feasible and acceptable means of overcoming the obstacles encountered in the implementation of school-based drug prevention programs, and (2) it was effective in decreasing alcohol misuse and related harm.  CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module was developed in collaboration with teachers, students and relevant health and legal professionals. The final curriculum based program consists of six lessons, each with two components. The first component involves students completing an interactive computer-based program, with the second consisting of a variety of individual, small group and class-based activities.  The feasibility and efficacy of CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module was assessed utilising a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1434, Year 8 students (13 years old) from sixteen schools. CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module was found to be both feasible and acceptable in the school setting. The provision of alcohol prevention information in the background of a computerised teenage drama provided young people with an education program they enjoyed in a context to which they could relate. Teachers reported a willingness to implement CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module in routine practice. They believed it to be a high quality program which was superior to other drug education programs.  CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module led to significant increases in knowledge of harm minimisation skills and subdued alcohol related expectancies. It was effective in reducing alcohol use, misuse and related harms for females, but not for males. The differential effects of gender are extensively discussed and implications for future research considered. CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module was clearly both feasible and acceptable and has the potential to offer an innovative new platform for the delivery of prevention programs in schools.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teenagers -- Alcohol use -- Australia -- Prevention -- Computer-assisted instruction.</field><field name="subject">High school students -- Alcohol use -- Australia -- Prevention -- Computer-assisted instruction.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholism -- Studey and teaching -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholism -- Australia -- Prevention -- Computer-assisted instruction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the bipolar inline radiofrequency ablation device (ILRFA) in liver and kidney transection.</field><field name="creator">Yao, Peng, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surgical resection is the best option for both liver and kidney cancers, which providing the long term survival. However intraoperative blood loss can be a significant challenge, and is clearly associated with morbidity and mortality. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) precoagulation has been introduced into liver and kidney surgery. Promising results have already achieved in reduction of intraoperative blood loss. In this thesis, a detailed explanation on precoagulation by RFA has been given. Our group developed a novel bipolar multi-array RFA device ??? InLine (ILRFA). In this thesis, we have investigated the performance in a variety of fields. In the study of ILRFA-assisted laparoscopic liver resection, ILRFA was easily employed through a hand port and achieved significant decrease of blood loss compared to control group (p &lt; 0.05). In the liver trauma study, ILRFA produced a 63.88% reduction of blood loss in peripheral injury and 53.57% in central injury respectively. In postoperative evaluation of ILRFA-assisted liver resection, animals underwent an uneventful recovery, no complications occurred. Histological examination revealed a typical post RFA evolution. In ILRFA-assisted partial nephrectomy, the mean intraoperative blood loss 35 ?? 7 ml in the ILRFA and 152 ?? 94 ml in the control, a 77.0% reduction (P = 0.024). The mean blood loss per centimetre resection area was 2.09 ?? 1.41 ml/cm2 in the ILRFA compared with 12.79 ?? 1.68 ml/cm2 in controls, the reduction was 79.0% (P = 0.019). In ILRFAassisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, the mean intraoperative blood loss was 32 ?? 15 ml in the ILRFA and 187 ?? 69 ml in the control group, a 77.0% reduction (P = 0.043).

The most commonly used device is the osmotic tablet, which is essentially a tablet core that is coated with a rate-limiting semipermeable membrane. The feasibility of applying a coating onto a tablet using dense gas techniques was studied. Two different coating materials, polymethymethacrylate (PMMA, Mw = 120,000 g/mol) and cellulose acetate (CA, 39.8 wt% acetyl content) were applied onto an 8 mm osmotic tablet core using the Gas Anti-solvent (GAS) process.  For PMMA, the pressurisation rate, coating temperature and volumetric expansion of up to 250% had minimal effect on the coating quality. The concentration, solvent type and the use of polyethylene glycol (Mw = 200 g/mol) had a more pronounced effect on the coating. The coating process was optimised to apply a smooth and uniform coating with a 50 ??m thickness. For CA, the pressurisation rate and the coating temperature had little effect on the coating that was applied. The process was more sensitive to a change in the concentration of the solution and the volumetric expansion that was used. It was found that the concentration could not be increased too much without affecting the coating quality.  A CA coating was applied onto a PMMA-coated tablet using the optimised conditions. The thickness in the tablet coating increased by 10 ??m. Dissolution tests of the uncoated and coated tablets were carried out. The CA coatings were found to be insufficient in limiting the rate of water entering the tablet and performed similarly to an uncoated tablet core. The PMMA coatings were found to limit the rate of delivery of the model drug. However, variations in the PMMA coatings resulted in an inconsistent delivery profile across batches. The tablets coated with both PMMA and CA had a delivery rate in between that of uncoated and PMMA-coated tablets, indicating that the application of the second coating had compromised the initial PMMA coating.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tablets (Medicine) -- Technological innovations.</field><field name="subject">Coatings.</field><field name="subject">Coating processes.</field><field name="subject">Solubility.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental and theoretical investigation of knee kinematics: a theoretical application to joint reconstruction techniques</field><field name="creator">Dabirrahmani, Dan??, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Passive knee motion is guided by the interaction of the articular surfaces and the restraining role of the soft-tissue structures. It is defined by characteristic kinematics within an envelope of motion. The main goal of this thesis was to simulate this characteristic motion by developing a subject-specific anatomically based finite element model. CT and MR image stacks were used to develop the geometry model and experimental (mechanical) test data was used as model input. Passive knee flexion was simulated and translational and rotational motion described using the Joint Coordinate System (JCS). The model was validated using clinical flexion and AP drawer tests.  An ACL reconstruction model was also developed. Highest AP laxity was found at 30?? of flexion when the graft was positioned in the original native ACL insertion point. ACL tunnel positions were simulated according to surgical techniques. For this case, the highest AP laxity was displayed at 0?? of flexion. Four different graft materials were examined, with the quadriceps tendon graft exhibiting highest laxity, followed by the patellar tendon, braided hamstring and finally unbraided hamstring graft. The effect of malpositioning the graft's femoral attachment point from its central location was also investigated. The proximal femoral attachment point most closely mimicked the central attachment point in terms of AP laxity in the native ACL insertion group. In the ACL tunnel group, the posterior femoral attachment point most closely mimicked the intact knee.  In this thesis it was found that changing the femoral insertion point of the graft can highly influence the AP laxity behaviour. Also using the surgical technique to create ACL tunnels may not necessarily produce the same kinematic behaviour as the intact knee.  Lastly, this thesis has shown the importance of explicitly defining the local reference coordinate system when describing knee kinematics. Changing the coordinate system markedly alters the calculated kinematics. Ideally, a standardisation of local coordinate systems, similar to the JCS, would be proposed within the biomechanics community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knee -- Mechanical properties.</field><field name="subject">Joints -- Surgery.</field><field name="subject">Kinematics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biosynthesis and characterisation of polyhydroxyalkanoate based natural-synthetic hybrid copolymers.</field><field name="creator">Sanguanchaipaiwong, Vorapat, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Natural-synthetic hydrid biomaterials have been isolated from the growth of Alcaligenes latus and Pseudomonas oleovorans in the presence of diethylene glycol (DEG). A. latus could cometabolise DEG with 10 g/L glucose, while DEG was consumed by P. oleovorans with 20 mM sodium octanoate or octanoic acid. The presence of DEG in bioprocessing systems for the production of short chain length (scl-) and medium chain length (mcl-) PHAs consequently lowered cell viability and PHA yield. Cell morphology was slightly changed, but the PHA inclusion bodies apparently were not. DEG affected the composition of the mclPHA which was confirmed to be polyhydroxyoctanoate (PHO) with a significant increase in the C8 component. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to quantitatively monitor DEG in the system and revealed its cellular adsorption. Intracellularly, the DEG significantly decreased the molar weight of the mclPHA and sclPHA. P1PH NMR, 2-D COSY and HSQC spectra confirmed that the polymer samples consisted of PHA chains terminated by DEG. Similar to the cultivation of P. oleovorans with DEG, the presence of PEG200 and PEG400 also had an effect on cell growth, PHO yield and cell viability. Furthermore, a hybrid copolymer of PHO-PEG200 was synthesised. The synthesis of these natural-synthetic hybrid copolymers could lead the way for a wide variety of PHA-PEG copolymers with a range of bioactive properties. All thermal properties of PHB were higher than those of PHB-DEG. This may be due to a combination of lower PHB molecular weight and termination of the chains by DEG, i.e. ???DEGylation???. However, PHB-DEG was more elastomeric when compared to PHB, showing properties similar to its copolymer with 20 mol% 3-hydroxyvalerate. Contact angles revealed that the PHB-DEG film was slightly more hydrophilic than PHB. Despite the large difference in their respective proportions, the comparatively small DEG component exerted an influence on chain confirmation, such that solvent casting under humid conditions apparently induced self-assembly and formed a disordered microporous film. DEGylation of PHO also had noticeable effects on the physiochemical properties of the biopolymer. A major decrease in molecular weight, together with the termination of hydrophobic PHO chains with hydrophilic end-groups resulted in changes to its thermal properties when compared to PHO. In comparison to PHO, solvent cast films of PHO-DEG were apparently less flexible, but more hydrophilic.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Copolymers -- Thermal properties</field><field name="subject">Biosynthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated metal spinning: visual tracking and force control methodologies.</field><field name="creator">Hanafi, Daniel, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis presents the development of force controller to maintain desired normal forces during a very stiff contact operation conducted in a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine. Force controller approach described in this thesis requires the accurate knowledge of the nominal tool path a priori. Obtaining the nominal tool path accurately is carried out by a vision based profile tracking system presented in this thesis. Both the force control and visual profile tracking systems require the development of an active control system to respond to force and vision signals.  To facilitate the active control, a two-stage approach has been taken. The first stage is to bring the CNC machine under real-time control of an external computer. The second stage is the design of the active axis controller. This is achieved by adding sensor feedback loops to the external axis controller.  The purpose of the active vision based profile tracking system is to automatically generate the tool path accurately. Emphasis is on combining low resolution vision with visual control of the precision CNC machine to attain the accuracy required for metal spinning. Combination of visual profile tracking and an edge detection method that gives sub-pixel accuracy were used to obtain the required tool path. A curvature detection algorithm was developed to identify segments of the tool path by assuming that the tool path consists of circular and straight line segments.  The developed active force controller operates in a dynamic setup and is used to maintain tool forces at desired levels. The complete control system operates in a manner similar to reaction compensation and the force controller can be viewed as an integrating on-off controller with minimum integral wind-up effect. As a result, a direct dependency of the control efforts on error signals has been eliminated. In addition, the force controller brings in artificial damping that ensures the stability of the control system. To demonstrate the effect of the force controller, spun component qualities were assessed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metal spinning.</field><field name="subject">Electronic controllers -- Design and construction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissecting the requirement for Cited2 during heart development and left-right patterning of the mouse embryo.</field><field name="creator">Lopes Floro, Kylie, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cited2 is a member of the Cited gene family, which has no homology to any other genes. It encodes a transcriptional co-factor that is expressed during early heart formation (cardiogenesis). Embryos lacking Cited2 display a range of cardiac defects including bilaterally identical atria, aortic arch abnormalities, rotation of the aorta and pulmonary artery, and malseptation of the cardiac chambers. The latter results in communication between the aorta and pulmonary artery, the aorta and both ventricles, and the atria and ventricles (with themselves and each other). Cardiogenesis is complex, and requires many different cell types and processes to occur correctly. Some of these cells and processes are external to the primary heart. For example, once the initial muscle cells of the heart form a tube, cells from other regions such as the secondary heart field (adjacent mesoderm) and cardiac neural crest (ectoderm) migrate into this tube, and are required for the formation of additional muscle cells and septa. Furthermore, cardiogenesis also requires correct left-right patterning of the embryo to be established prior to heart formation. To understand the developmental origins of the cardiac defects observed in Cited2-null embryos, the expression pattern of Cited2 and the anatomy of Cited2-null embryo hearts were studied. Subsequently, the expression of genes required for left-right patterning were studied in both Cited2-null and Cited2 conditionally-deleted embryos. This demonstrated that Cited2 may be required in many, possibly all, of the processes required for cardiogenesis. Next this study focused on the role of Cited2 in patterning the left-right axis of the embryo. Firstly, Cited2 was found to regulate the expression of the master regulator of left-right patterning (Nodal). Secondly, Cited2 was shown to regulate the expression of the left-specific transcription factor Pitx2 independently of Nodal. Thirdly, gene expression and conditional deletions of Cited2 suggested that Cited2 might regulate left-right patterning in the paraxial mesoderm, a tissue which has not previously been shown to regulate the left-right axis in the mouse. Lastly, an argument is made suggesting the possibility that all the cardiac defects found in Cited2-null embryos may directly or indirectly stem from a failure of correct left-right patterning.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Differentiation.</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Embryology.</field><field name="subject">Embryology -- Experimental.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing dynamic XML data</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Damien Kaine, School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of XML, a markup language for representing semi-structured data.

This thesis analyzes several problems that arise when constructing XML data management systems, particularly in the case where such systems must handle dynamic content.  In the first chapter, we consider the problem of incremental schema validation, which arises in almost any XML database system.  We build upon previous work by finding several classes of schemas for which very efficient algorithms exist. We also develop an algorithm that works for any schema, and prove that it is optimal.  In the second chapter, we turn to the problem of improving query evaluation times on extremely large database systems. In particular, we boost the performance of the structural and twig joins, fundamental XML query evaluation techniques, through the use of an adaptive index. This index tunes itself to the query workload, providing a 20-80% boost in speed for these join operators.  The adaptive nature of the index also allows updates to the database to be easily tracked.  While accurate selectivity estimation is a critical problem in any database system due to its importance in choosing optimal query plans, there has been very little work on selectivity estimation in the presence of updates. We ask whether it is possible to design a structure for selectivity in XML databases that is updateable, and can return results with theoretically sound error guarantees. Through a combination of lower and upper bounds, we give strong evidence suggesting that this is unlikely in practice.  Motivated by these results, we then develop a heuristic selectivity estimation structure for XML databases. This structure is the first such synopsis that can handle all aspects of core XPath, and is also updateable.  Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">XML.</field><field name="subject">Dynamic.</field><field name="subject">Data.</field><field name="subject">Databases.</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured.</field><field name="subject">Trees.</field><field name="subject">XML (Document markup language)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the behaviour of reactive powder concrete columns</field><field name="creator">Malik, Adnan Rauf, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis was carried out in two phases to investigate the behaviour of reactive powder concrete (RPC) columns.  In the first phase of this study, six steel fibre reinforced RPC columns of 150 mm square cross section were tested to failure under various loading eccentricities. The RPC mix contained 2 percent (by volume) of straight steel fibres with a concrete strength of about 150 MPa. The columns contained either 4 or 7 percent of longitudinal reinforcement but no tie reinforcement in the test region. All the columns failed in a controlled manner and no buckling of the longitudinal steel or cover spalling was observed, even well beyond the peak load. The tests revealed that stirrups can be significantly reduced for steel fibre reinforced RPC columns, which could lead to an increase in the speed of construction with an associated potential reduction in construction costs.  In the second phase, 17 RPC columns were tested with 16 confined using carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP). The concrete mix contained either no fibres or 2 percent (by volume) of straight steel fibres with concrete strength of approximately 160 MPa. The columns contained no conventional steel reinforcement. For the concentrically loaded specimens, failure occurred at or close to the peak loading and the CFRP increased the strength by 19 percent compared with the unconfined specimen. The tests showed that the formulae developed to predict the peak strength of concentrically loaded FRP confined conventional strength concrete columns, in general, overestimate the load carrying capacity of FRP confined RPC specimens. The CFRP was shown to be effective in controlling the failure for the eccentrically loaded specimens. There was no evidence, however, that the use of CFRP in the hoop direction significantly increased the strength of the columns.  Three dimensional nonlinear FE analyses of the test specimens were undertaken using the program DIANA. The FE analyses showed a reasonable comparison with the experimental results for the specimens tested under eccentric loading.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Concrete construction -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ambivalent ground: re-placing Australian literature</field><field name="creator">Paull, James, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Narratives of place have always been crucial to the construction of Australian identity. The obsession with identity in Australia betrays longstanding uncertainty. It is not difficult to interpret in this uncertainty a replaying of the deeper insecurities surrounding the settler community's legal and more broadly cultural claims to the land. Such insecurities are typically understood negatively. In contrast, this thesis accepts the uncertainty of identity as an activating principle, appropriate to any interpretation of the narratives and themes that inform what it means to be Australian. Fundamental to this uncertainty is a provisionality in the post-colonial experience of place that is papered over by misleadingly coherent spatial narratives that stem from the imperial inheritance of Australian mythology. Place is a model for the tension between the coherence of mythic narratives and the actual rhizomic formlessness of daily life. Place is the ???ground??? of that life, but an ambivalent ground. An Ambivalent Ground approaches postcolonial Australia as a densely woven text. In this text, stories that describe the founding of a nation are enveloped by other stories, not so well known, that work to transform those more familiar narratives. ???Re-placing Australian literature??? describes the process of this transformation. It signifies an interpretative practice which seeks to recuperate the open-ended experience of place that remains disguised by the coherent narratives of nationhood. The process of ???re-placing??? Australian literature shifts the understanding of nation towards a landscape that speaks not so much about identity as about the constitutive performances of everyday life. It also converges with the unhomely dimension that is the colonist's ambiguous sense of belonging. We can understand this process with an analogy used in this thesis, that of music ??? the colonising language, and noise ??? the ostensibly inchoate, unformed background disruptive to cultural order yet revealing the spatial realities of place. Traditionally, cultural narratives in Australia have disguised the much more complex way in which place noisily disrupts and diffracts those narratives, and in the process generates the ambivalence of Australian identity. Rather than a text or a narrative, place is a plenitude, a densely intertwined performance space, a performance that constantly renders experience ??? and its cultural function ??? transgressive. The purpose of this thesis is not to displace stereotypical narratives of nationhood with yet another narrative. Rather, it offers the more risky proposition that provisionality and uncertainty are constitutive features of Australian social being. The narrative in the thesis represents an aggregation of such an ambivalent ground, addressing the persistent tension between place and the larger drama of colonialist history and discourse.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian literature -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Landscape in literature.</field><field name="subject">Cultural history and literary imagination.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A segmented interior permanent magnet synchronous machine with wide field-weakening range.</field><field name="creator">Dutta, Rukmi, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many high performance drive applications require wide Constant Power Speed Range (CPSR) for efficient use of energy. The examples of such applications are the starter alternator system of automobiles proposed for the 42V PowerNet, traction in the hybrid/electric vehicle, wind power generator etc. The Permanent Magnet (PM) machine is the natural choice of such niche applications because of their higher efficiency and compact size. However, the Surface Permanent Magnet (SPM) machine with sine distributed winding and radially-laminated Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) machine with conventional structure has very limited or zero flux-weakening capability. The flux-weakening capability of the SPM machine can be improved by using concentrated, fractional-slot stator but here well-known advantages of the sine distributed winding are needed to be compromised. In the IPM machine, fluxweakening was improved using axial lamination and more than two magnet layers per pole. However, the construction of such IPM machine is complicated and expensive. This thesis presents design and analysis of a new type of the Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) machine that have a very wide Constant Power Speed Range (CPSR) without compromising simplicity of construction and advantages of the distribution winding. In the new IPM machine, the magnet poles were segmented in the radially direction and the iron bridges between magnet segments provide for additional paths of flux-canalization to give the rotor an inherent capability of fluxweakening. Consequently, a very wide constant power speed range can be achieved in such machines. The proposed IPM machine of this work was referred as the Segmented IPM machine. The thesis focuses on the optimization of the Segmented IPM machine in a 42V environment of the automobile. First, for the conceptual evaluation a 4 pole, 550W Segmented Magnet IPM machine was optimized using finite element analysis. The parameters were calculated for prediction of the steady-state and transient performances. The torque- and power-speed capability were estimated using time-step, circuit-coupled finite element analysis. The cogging torque and variation of iron loss with frequency were also investigated during the design process. A prototype machine was constructed on the basis of the optimized design. The steady-state and transient performances of the prototype machine were measured and compared with the predicted results for experimental verification. The measured performance analysis was found to match very well with the predicted results. The measured torque- and power-speed capability of the Segmented IPM machine was also compared to those of a conventional, non-segmented IPM machine of similar rating and size. The thesis also presents the optimized design of a 6kW, 12 pole Segmented Magnet IPM machine for application in the Integrated Starter Alternator (ISA) of the electric/hybrid vehicle. It can be concluded from the predicted steady-state analysis of the 6 kW, 12 pole Segmented Magnet IPM machine that it should be able to satisfy most of the required criteria of an ISA with appropriate design optimization.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Permanent magnet motors -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Electric motors, Synchronous.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making things to think with.</field><field name="creator">White, Karen Sue, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Distributed cognition has been emerging as a new research direction in cognitive science over the last two decades and is gaining momentum.

The first essay is motivated by recent field evidence suggesting significant reliance on conventional techniques (e.g. NPV and DCF) without assessment of the decision profile - its degree of uncertainty, ambiguity and knowledge distribution. However, without knowing the decision profile, the chosen decision might not be appropriate given the decision situation. Therefore, essay 1 develops a multi-faceted conceptualization of the decision profile and provides a prescriptive model for choosing appraisal methods based on this profile. Specifically, it prescribes the limited use of conventional methods to low ambiguity and uncertainty situations and using decision trees, real options, scenario planning and case-based methods as the level of uncertainty increases. In high ambiguity situations, however, the only viable approaches are case-based methods which do not have perfect information assumption that conventional alternative methods do.  Case-based methods have been supported theoretically in case-based decisions and case-based reasoning literature but lags in its use in business decision-making. Possible reasons for this include a lack of concrete applications and developments of major concepts such as its case memory, similarity and prediction functions. Therefore, essay 2 proposes a model of case-based decisions called similarity-based forecasting (SBF) and applies it to a high uncertainty and ambiguity situation -- namely forecasting movie success. In doing so, it outlines operational definitions of the memory, similarity and prediction functions and, based on data from the entertainment industry, provides empirical support for the hypothesis that case-based methods can be more accurate than regression forecasting; both SBF and combined SBF-regression models were able to predict movie gross revenues with 40% and 50% greater accuracy than regression respectively. This essay concludes with a discussion of some possible directions for future research including applications using data from other domains and settings, testing the boundary conditions for which the SBF approach should be applied, experiments using SBF under uncertainty and complexity manipulations, and 'time stamped' comparisons with predictions made using information markets (e.g. Hollywood Stock Exchange).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business -- Decision making.</field><field name="subject">Business forecasting.</field><field name="subject">Management information systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The internationalisation of financial services firms</field><field name="creator">Young, Owen, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most financial institutions have not been successful at internationalisation, with some being remarkably unsuccessful. There are fewer occurrences of cross-border mergers and acquisitions than in most other industries. Foreign financial institutions tend to underperform relative to domestic financial institutions. Rugman and others have argued that their internationalisation primarily occurs at the regional rather than global level.  Existing theories identify some barriers to firms? internationalisation, but these theories, were developed for manufacturing firms, and were rarely applied to financial services firms. This research seeks to identify barriers to financial institutions' internationalisation  and contribute to the under-researched area of services internationalisation. To better understand the barriers to internationalisation, qualitative research techniques were used for an in-depth case-study analysis of one firm and its attempts at internationalisation, followed by detailed interviews of internationally experienced financial institutions executives from other firms. Finally, the apparent preference for regional over global expansion was investigated, through a quantitative analysis of over 12,000 cross-border, financial-services merger and acquisition transactions from 1990 to mid-2005.  The research identified thirty-eight barriers to internationalisation, consistent with Rugman's findings on regional expansion, but also with the effects of similarity variables such as language, culture and legal system. The quantitative analysis tested these effects and found that the region effect was high, and was stronger than language and cultural effects individually, but about the same as their combined effect. The legal system similarity is not statistically significant when all effects are combined.  This research contributes to this under-researched field. Given that internationalisation supports economic growth in the host and home countries, an improved understanding of these barriers may assist policy makers and enable managers to make better international investment decisions. The findings on the effect of geography versus other factors, such as language and culture, may inform managers' choice of target countries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Globalization - Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Financial institutions.</field><field name="subject">Financial services industry.</field><field name="subject">International business enterprises.</field><field name="subject">International finance.</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Banking Corporation (Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic update for operating systems</field><field name="creator">Baumann, Andrew, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Patches to modern operating systems, including bug fixes and security updates, and the reboots and downtime they require, cause tremendous problems for system users and administrators. The aim of this research is to develop a model for dynamic update of operating systems, allowing a system to be patched without the need for a reboot or other service interruption. In this work, a model for dynamic update based on operating system modularity is developed and evaluated using a prototype implementation for the K42 operating system. The prototype is able to update kernel code and data structures, even when the interfaces between kernel modules change. When applying an update, at no point is the system's entire execution blocked, and there is no additional overhead after an update has been applied. The base runtime overhead is also very low. An analysis of the K42 revision history shows that approximately 79% of past performance and bug-fix changes to K42 could be converted to dynamic updates, and the proportion would be even higher if the changes were being developed for dynamic update. The model also extends to other systems such as Linux and BSD, that although structured modularly, are not strictly object-oriented like K42.  The experience with this approach shows that dynamic update for operating systems is feasible given a sufficiently-modular system structure, allows maintenance patches and updates to be applied without disruption, and need not constrain system performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer science.</field><field name="subject">Operating systems (Computers)</field><field name="subject">Dynamic update.</field><field name="subject">Software maintenance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for managing the evolving web service protocols in service-oriented architectures.</field><field name="creator">Ryu, Seung Hwan, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Service-Oriented Architectures, everything is a service and services can interact with each other when needed. Web services (or simply services) are loosely coupled software components that are published, discovered, and invoked across the Web. As the use of Web services  grows, in order to correctly interact with the growing services, it is important to understand the business protocols that provide clients with the information on how to interact with services. In dynamic Web services environments, service providers need to constantly adapt their business protocols for reflecting the restrictions and requirements proposed by new applications, new business strategies, and new laws, or for fixing the problems found in the protocol definition. However, the effective management of such a protocol evolution raises critical problems: one of the most critical issues is to handle instances running under the old protocol when their protocol has been changed. Simple solutions, such as aborting them or allowing them to continue to run according to the old protocol, can be considered, but they are inapplicable for many reasons (e.g., the lose of work already done and the critical nature of work). We present a framework that supports service administrators in managing the business protocol evolution by providing several features, such as a set of change operators allowing modifications of protocols, a variety of protocol change impact analyses automatically determining which ongoing instances can be migrated to the new version of protocol, and data mining techniques inducing a model for classifying ongoing instances migrateable to the new protocol. To support the protocol evolution process, we have also developed database-backed GUI tools on top of our existing system. The proposed approach and tools can help service administrators in managing the evolution of ongoing instances when the business protocols of services with which they are interacting have changed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business protocol.</field><field name="subject">Web services.</field><field name="subject">Evolution.</field><field name="subject">Computer architecture.</field><field name="subject">Computer network architectures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photochemical and biological production of superoxide: Effect on redox cycling and bioavailability of iron.</field><field name="creator">Garg, Shikha, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Superoxide, a reduced form of dioxygen is produced in natural waters from abiotic thermal processes such as iron(II) oxygenation photochemically, and biologically in natural waters. Superoxide is highly redox-active due to the presence of an unpaired electron and plays an important role in the geochemical cycling of trace metals and degradation of organic pollutants in natural waters. It also has a significant effect on the physiology of aquatic microorganisms and has been implicated in the growth of toxic microalga in coastal areas of Japan, Australia and Canada.  The generation of superoxide by both biotic and photochemical pathways is described in this thesis and attention given to selected reactions of superoxide in simulated natural waters. Particular attention in this work has been given to the interaction of superoxide and iron and the impact of this interaction on iron availability to Chattonella marina, a red-tide phytoplankton frequently associated with fish-mortalities in Australia and Japan. Superoxide production from both phototchemical and biological sources is measured using a highly sensitive chemiluminescence technique and the effect of superoxide production on iron transformation under various environmental conditions is investigated by employing spectrophotometric techniques with high sensitivity and temporal resolution. The intermediacy of superoxide in iron acquisition mechanism by C. marina is also investigated using a radioisotope labeling technique. Our experimental results show that superoxide in natural waters is produced via reduction of dioxygen. The reduction of dioxygen takes place by transfer of electrons by the photo-excited quinone moieties present in natural organic matter or by reductases located on the outer cell membrane of organisms' surface. The experimental results suggest that the fate of iron in marine waters is closely related to the superoxidedioxygen redox couple. Superoxide can reduce a wide range of organically complexed iron(III) species to the more soluble iron(II) redox state, thus affecting its bioavailability. A simple kinetic model for redox-cycling of iron in the presence of superoxide is developed. In addition, by coupling the model for redox-cycling of iron with the forms of iron acquired by C. marina, a generalized mathematical model for iron acquisition is presented which satisfactorily describes all results obtained.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Superoxide.</field><field name="subject">Iron.</field><field name="subject">Water chemistry.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Naturally-occurring chemical tracers in seawater and their application to verifying mid-ocean ballast water exchange.</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Kathleen Ruth, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent regulation mandates that ships conduct mid ocean ballast water exchange (BWE) prior to discharging foreign ballast in territorial waters of Australia, the U.S. and elsewhere. The enforcement of ballast water exchange legislation is undermined, however, by a lack of sensitive and reliable methods for verifying compliance. One way to assess compliance is to compare the concentrations of chemical tracers in ballast tanks with their known distributions in the open ocean. In this work, dissolved organic matter and trace elements are investigated as potential tracers of mid-ocean ballast water exchange on commercial voyages in the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are frequently used as tracers of water masses in bays and estuaries. Characterization of the underlying fluorescence spectra in seawater dissolved organic matter was performed using parallel factor analysis, allowing the identification of at least nine independently varying fluorescent components present in varying concentrations in the ocean and in ballast water. Two of the humic components were terrestrial in origin and their signals could be traced in the open ocean (Pacific and Atlantic) at levels of approximately 1.5% of riverine concentrations. One humic terrestrial component was sufficient for predicting the coastal vs. oceanic source of most ballast water samples, suggesting that single and dual channel fluorometers could be optimized for verifying ballast water exchange. Barium, manganese and phosphorus were also investigated as potential tracers. Measurements of Ba and P obtained via engine-cooling pipes on commercial vessels were consistent with previous oceanographic measurements. While Ba behaved conservatively in ballast water, concentrations of phosphorus fluctuated and Mn was removed in ballast tanks over time. Ba and P demonstrated considerable promise as ballast water tracers, exhibiting predictable concentrations in exchanged ballast tanks, given a priori knowledge of the ocean (Atlantic versus Pacific) in which BWE was performed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ballast water exchange.</field><field name="subject">Chemical tracers.</field><field name="subject">Fluorescence.</field><field name="subject">Barium.</field><field name="subject">Manganese.</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus.</field><field name="subject">Seawater -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Ballast water -- Environmental aspects -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and numerical investigation of noise generation from the expansion of high velocity HVAC flows on board ocean going fast ferries</field><field name="creator">Neale, James Richard, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis details a study of strategies used to limit the flow generated noise encountered in the outlet diffusers of high velocity heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) duct systems. The underlying noise rating criterion is drawn from the specifications covering ocean going aluminium fast ferries. Although directed primarily towards the fast ferry industry the results presented herein are applicable to other niche high velocity HVAC applications. Experimental tests have been conducted to prove the viability of a high velocity HVAC duct system in meeting airflow requirements whilst maintaining acceptable passenger cabin noise levels. A 50 mm diameter circular jet of air was expanded using a primary conical diffuser with a variety of secondary outlet configurations. Noise measurements were taken across a velocity range of 15 to 60 m/s. An optimum outlet design has been experimentally identified by varying the diffuser angle, outlet duct length and the termination grill. A 4 to 5 fold reduction in required duct area was achieved with the use of a distribution velocity of 20 to 30 ms-1, without exceeding the prescribed passenger cabin noise criteria. The geometric configuration of the diffuser outlet assembly was found to have a pronounced effect on the noise spectrum radiating from the duct outlet. The development of a numerical model capable of predicting the flow induced noise generated by airflow exiting a ventilation duct is also documented. The model employs a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) CFD model to calculate the turbulent flow field through the duct diffuser section and outlet. The flow-generated noise is then calculated using a far field acoustic postprocessor based on the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings integral based formulation of Lighthill???s acoustic analogy. Time varying flow field variables are used to calculate the fluctuating noise sources located at the duct outlet and the resulting far field sound pressure levels. This result is then used to  calculate the corresponding far field sound intensity and sound power levels. The numerical acoustic model has been verified and validated against the measured experimental results for multiple outlet diffuser configurations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air conditioning -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Air conditioning -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Ventilation -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Ventilation -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Heating -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Heating -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Shipping</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Particle and macromolecular fouling in submerged membrane</field><field name="creator">Negaresh, Ebrahim, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Particles and macromolecular components, including biopolymers (protein and carbohydrate), are viewed as the main foulants in the complex feed submerged membrane filtration systems such as membrane bioreactor (MBR). This work focused on two aspects of fouling in complex fluids: 1- Assessing fouling propensity and mechanisms for various model solutions. 2- Using of two specific solutions modelling biomass found in MBR for a better understanding of the fouling mechanisms in submerged MBR processes. Filtrations were carried out with 0.22 ??m PVDF hollow fibre membrane.  Alginate was used as a model for polysaccharide, bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model for protein, (un)washed yeast and bentonite were representing suspended solid contents. According to the data obtained during this study the fouling propensity of each model solution was classified as follow in a decreasing order: Alginate &amp;gt unwashed yeast &amp;gt washed yeast &amp;gt BSA &amp;gt bentonite for one-component solutions; and Alginate-washed yeast &amp;gt Alginate-BSA &amp;gt Alginate-bentonite &amp;gt Alginate-unwashed yeast for two-component solutions. Introducing the alginate increased the reversible fouling (except BSA). Passive adsorption had a significant effect on fouling of alginate even before the beginning of the filtration. Washed yeast and a mixture of washed yeast + BSA were then used as model solutions to simulate the activated sludge found in MBR. The concentration of washed yeast and BSA used in this study were calculated in order for the characterisations of the two model solution to match (in terms of biopolymer contents) those of MBR biomasses reported in the literature. By rinsing, backwashing and chemical cleaning of the membrane, three fouling layers of upper, intermediate and lower were defined respectively. Results obtained from the analysis of the biopolymers found in the cleaning solutions allow a better understanding of the fouling mechanisms occurring for the two model solutions used in this study: for washed yeast, the lower layer and for washed yeast + BSA , the upper and intermediate layers were found to have relatively high biopolymeric composition. This was explained by higher concentration of solids on the membrane surface and by higher biopolymer interactions when washed yeast was mixed with BSA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Membrane bioreactor.</field><field name="subject">Fouling.</field><field name="subject">Membrane filters.</field><field name="subject">Particles.</field><field name="subject">Polysaccharide.</field><field name="subject">Bentonite.</field><field name="subject">Biopolymer.</field><field name="subject">Hollow fibre.</field><field name="subject">Characterisation.</field><field name="subject">Soluble microbial products.</field><field name="subject">Macromolecular.</field><field name="subject">Fouling organisms.</field><field name="subject">Carbohydrate.</field><field name="subject">Model solutions.</field><field name="subject">Extracellular polymeric.substances</field><field name="subject">Alginate.</field><field name="subject">Yeast.</field><field name="subject">Bovine serum albumin.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Architectural support for security and reliability in embedded processors</field><field name="creator">Ragel, Roshan Gabriel, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Security and reliability in processor based systems are concerns requiring adroit solutions. Security is often compromised by code injection attacks, jeopardizing even ???trusted software???. Reliability is of concern, where unintended code is executed in modern processors with ever smaller feature sizes and low voltage swings causing bit flips. Countermeasures by software-only approaches increase code size and therefore significantly reduce performance. Hardware assisted approaches use additional hardware monitors and thus incur considerably high hardware cost and have scalability problems. Considering reliability and security issues during the design of an embedded system has its advantages as this overcomes the limitations of existing solutions. The research work presented in this thesis combines two elements: one, defining a hardware software design framework for reliability and security monitoring at the granularity of micro-instructions, and two, applying this framework for real world problems. At a given time, a processor executes only a few instructions and large part of the processor is idle. Utilizing these idling hardware components by sharing them with the monitoring hardware, to perform security and reliability monitoring reduces   the impact of the monitors on hardware cost. Using micro-instruction routines within the machine instructions, allows us to share most of the monitoring hardware. Therefore, our technique requires little hardware overhead in comparison to having additional hardware blocks outside the processor. This reduction in overhead is due to maximal sharing of hardware resources of the processor. Our framework is superior to software-only techniques as the monitoring routines are formed with micro-instructions and therefore reduces code size and execution time overheads, since they occur in parallel with machine instructions. This dissertation makes four significant contributions to the field of security and reliability on embedded processor research and they are: (i) proposed a security and reliability framework for embedded processors that could be included into its design phase; (ii) shown that inline (machine instruction level) monitoring will detect common security attacks (four inline monitors against common attacks cost 9.21% area and 0.67% performance, as opposed to previous work where an external monitor with two monitoring modules costs 15% area overhead); (iii) illustrated that basic block check-summing for code integrity is much simpler and efficient than currently proposed integrity violation detectors which address code injection attacks (this costs 5.03% area increase and 3.67% performance penalty with a single level control flow checking, as opposed to previous work where the area overhead is 5.59%, which needed three control flow levels of integrity checking); and (iv) shown that hardware assisted control flow checking implemented during the design of a processor is much cheaper and effective than software only approaches (this approach costs 0.24-1.47% performance and 3.59% area overheads, as opposed to previous work that costs 53.5-99.5% performance).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Embedded Systems</field><field name="subject">Computer Architecture</field><field name="subject">Embedded Processors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performing under overload</field><field name="creator">Macpherson, Luke, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation argues that admission control should be applied as early as possible within a system. To that end, this dissertation examines the benefits and trade-offs involved in applying admission control to a networked computer system at the level of the network interface hardware.  Admission control has traditionally been applied in software, after significant resources have already been expended on processing a request. This design decision leads to systems whose algorithmic cost is a function of the load applied to the system, rather than the load admitted to the system.  By performing admission control at the network interface, it is possible to develop systems whose algorithmic cost is a function of load admitted to the system, rather than load applied to the system. Such systems are able to deal with excessive applied loads without exhibiting performance degradation.  This dissertation first examines existing admission control approaches, focussing on the cost of admission control within those systems. It then goes on to develop a model of system behaviour under overload, and the impact of admission control on that behaviour. A new class of admission control mechanisms which are able to perform load rejection using the network interface hardware are then described, along with a prototype implementation using commodity hardware.  A prototype implementation in the FreeBSD operating system is evaluated for a variety of network protocols and performance is compared to the standard FreeBSD implementation. Performance and scalability under overload is significantly improved.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer systems -- Access control.</field><field name="subject">Network overload.</field><field name="subject">Network interface.</field><field name="subject">Admission control.</field><field name="subject">Load rejection.</field><field name="subject">Load factor design.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks -- Design and construction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeking new understanding and applications of 1,1' -Bisisoquinolines</field><field name="creator">Chan, Benjamin Kin Heng, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has two parts. The first deals with the conformational behaviour of Nsubstituted and N-unsubstituted bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives under neutral and acidic conditions and the second describes the design, synthesis and structural characterization of a new class of N-ureidyl bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives, potential catch and release agents. Four N-alkyl derivatives, two of which were new, were studied in detail for their conformational behaviour and their spectroscopic properties compared extensively with N-unsubstituted compounds. NMR chemical shift changes and vicinal spin couplings were measured and related to conformational change within the heterocyclic rings and about the central C1-C1' axis. The basicity of the amines were determined through pKa measurements, and differences between the behaviour of secondary and tertiary amine examples discussed. Analysis of titration results revealed the formation of discrete 1:1 and 1:2 complexes between the secondary examples and added carboxylic acids, but only 1:1 complexes in the case of tertiary amine complexes. Monitoring of changes in conformation with incremental addition of acid provided new understanding about modes of binding.  A new class of nine ureidyl bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives has been prepared. These contain N'-aryl and N'-adamantyl urea groups attached to the bisisoquinoline core through alkyl linker groups with varying length. The conformation of these derivatives were heavily dependent upon the linker length while the nature of the urea group (in one case a thiourea) played a small role in the preferred conformation of the bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline. Three non-isoquinoline derived model ureidyl amine systems were also synthesized for comparative studies. Four partner ureidyl acids were prepared and their pKa values in DMSO were measured. Studies of the interaction of the ureidyl acids with the ureidyl amines revealed that the chain length of the ureidyl bistetrahydroisoquinoline linker played a small role while the remote aryl and adamantyl groups of both acids and amines played a more important role. DMSO was found to interfere with the normal conformations of the ureidyl bis-tetrahydroisoquinolines and with the interaction of the ureidyl bis-tetrahydroisoquinolines with their partner ureidyl acids in deuterochloroform. The latter studies will provide the basis for future design of catch-and-release agents derived from bis-tetrahydroisoquinolines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Isoquinoline.</field><field name="subject">Tetrahydroisoquinolines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing multiplicity: exploring meaning through pictorial space and the interaction between realism and painterly expression</field><field name="creator">Lehmann, Chelsea, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The crux of this investigation is the combination of realist and abstract elements in pictorial space and negotiating the various pictorial problems this sets in motion. The interaction between these elements, especially in a spatial sense, creates both a visual and conceptual ambiguity central to the meaning of the work. Multiple treatments of painted form -- realist, expressive and abstract are interleaved producing divergent visual sensations.  The transition from one visual sensation to another, the way the eye traverses believable forms to suddenly collide with the canvas, forced there by raw, painted gesture, is an unpredictable journey invoking visual perplexity, thereby alerting the viewer to potential meanings; the research paintings are not just images of things, they are images of things that would not normally exist together, but do so to create a story. It is intended that the viewer be directed toward the subject of the painting as much as the qualities of the medium itself.  Influences as diverse as art historical painting, photography, the motion and lighting effects of film, the qualities of surface reflections and chiaroscuro, have been sourced to facilitate a new body of work. Directing the relationship of the viewer to the paintings through format and scale, (generally life size or very small) promotes a similar kind of interaction (the need to get up close and far away) to that of the application of pictorial space. This is an important aspect of the research; the optical process of focussing in and out is a microcosm of looking at the paintings installed in physical space.  The subject of the paintings is female sexuality and its connection to identity, relationships and self-expression. It is also the conceptual object of 'Multiplicity', a principal idea in the work, ambiguous pictorial situations suggesting reality is not one thing but a combination of remembered, existing and subconscious experience. In the research, this concept also pertains to the painter (using memory, experience and imagination) and the audience viewing the work at different times.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space in art.</field><field name="subject">Realism in art.</field><field name="subject">Abstraction in art.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of genetic variation in gene expression</field><field name="creator">Chan, Eva King-Fan, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Variations in gene expression have long been hypothesised to be the major cause of individual differences. An initial focus of this research thesis is to elucidate the genetic regulatory architecture of gene expression. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping analyses have been performed on expression levels of over 22,000 mRNAs from three tissues of a panel of recombinant inbred mice. These analyses are "single-locus" where "linkage" (i.e. significant correlation) between an expression trait and a putative eQTL is considered independently of other loci. Major conclusions from these analyses are:  1.	Gene expression is mainly influenced by genetic (sequence) variations that act in trans rather than in cis; 2.	Subsets of genes are controlled by master regulators that influence multiple genes; 3.	Gene expression is a polygenic trait with multiple regulators.  Single-locus mapping analyses are not designed for detecting multiple regulators of gene expression, and so observation of multiple-linkages (i.e. one expression trait mapped to multiple eQTLs) formed the basis of the second objective of this research project: to investigate the relationship between multiple-linkages and genotype pattern-association. A locus-pair is said to have associated genotype patterns if they have similar inheritance pattern across a panel of individuals, and these are attributed to one of fours sources: 1.	linkage disequilibrium between loci located on the same chromosome; 2.	non-syntenic association; 3.	random association; 4.	un-associated. To understand the validity of multiple-linkages observed in single-locus mapping studies, a newly developed method, bqtl.twolocus, is applied to confirm two-locus effects for a total of 898 out of 1,233 multiple-linkages identified from the three studies mentioned above as well as from seven publicly available eQTL-mapping studies. Combining these results with information of genotype pattern-association, a subset of 478 multiple-linkages has been deduced for which there is high confidence to be real.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gene expression.</field><field name="subject">Expression QTL.</field><field name="subject">Linkage disequilibrium.</field><field name="subject">Non-syntenic association.</field><field name="subject">Genotype pattern association.</field><field name="subject">Variation (Genetics)</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viral infection and propagation in plant tissue culture</field><field name="creator">Shadwick, Fiona Stella, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The propagation of wild-type virus and a transgenic viral vector was examined in cultured plant cells to identify factors affecting viral infection of and accumulation in cultured cells and to determine if viral vectors could be used to facilitate the expression of heterologous proteins in vitro.   Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) accumulation was examined in Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana suspension and hairy root cultures.  TMV accumulation was superior in N. benthamiana hairy roots.  Hairy roots were infected by adding TMV to the liquid culture medium at the same time as root inoculation.  Hairy root growth was unaffected by virus infection.  The distribution of virus within root mats from shake-flask grown cultures was non-uniform and the concentration of virus accumulated in replicate cultures was variable.  When N. benthamiana hairy roots were infected using 1.5 &#956;g mL-1 TMV, the average maximum concentration of virus accumulated in the biomass was 1.6  ?? 0.25 mg g-1 dry weight, or 15-fold lower than in TMV infected N. tabacum leaves.  Virus coat protein accumulated to a level of (26 ?? 10)% total soluble protein in the hairy roots.  Inoculum virus concentration and the medium in which infection was performed affected the virus yield and the percentage of inoculated cultures that accumulated virus.  When cultures were inoculated using 9.0 &#956;g mL-1 TMV, virus accumulated in the biomass to 4.2 ?? 0.60 mg g-1 dry weight.  Proportional scale-up of hairy root infection in shake flasks did not result in constant virus concentrations in the scaled cultures.  TMV accumulation in bioreactor-infected and -grown hairy roots was poor. N. benthamiana hairy roots were infected with a TMV-based vector (30B-GFPC3) that encoded Cycle 3 green fluorescent protein (GFP).  TMV-GFPC3 was (260 ?? 140)-fold less infectious than TMV as measured by local lesion assays.  Propagation of TMV-GFPC3 could not be confirmed using mass balance.  GFP was not detected in the infected hairy roots or the culture medium.  Hairy roots represent a potentially viable culture-based system for the in vitro production of virus and virus products when field-grown agricultural systems do not adequately address issues of containment or product safety.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant micropropagation.</field><field name="subject">Plant tissue culture.</field><field name="subject">Plant biotechnology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metonymy and trauma: re-presenting death in the literature of W. G. Sebald</field><field name="creator">Watts, Andrew Michael, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Novel: Fragments of a Former Moon The novel Fragments of a Former Moon (FFM) invokes the paradoxical earlier death of the still-living protagonist. The unmarried German woman is told that her skeletal remains have been discovered in Israel, thirty-eight years since her body was interred in 1967. This absurd premise raises issues of representing death in contemporary culture; death's destabilising effect on the individual's textual representation; post-Enlightenment dissolution of the modern rational self; and problems of mimetic post- Holocaust representation. Using W G Sebald's fiction as a point of departure, FFM's photographic illustrations connote modes of textual representation that disrupt the autobiographical self, invoking mortality and its a-temporal (representational) displacement. As with Sebald's recurring references to the Holocaust, FFM depicts a psychologically unstable protagonist seeking to recover repressed memories of an absent past. Research dissertation: Metonymy &amp;Trauma: Re-presenting Death in the Literature of W. G. Sebald. The dissertation centres on the effect of metonymy in the rhetoric of textually-constructed identity and its contemporary representation in the face of death. I concentrate on the effect of Holocaust trauma on representation and memory, relating trauma theory to the metonymy of W G Sebald's fiction, and situating representations of the traumatised self within the institution of modern bureaucracy. Using Ronald Schleifer's theory of metonymy I explore the rhetorical process by which Sebald seeks to depict the unrepresentable within Holocaust history, arguing that Sebald's correlation of text with image evokes problems of Holocaust discourse because it re-presents the past while recognising inadequacies within conventional narrative. Photography's function as an indexical trace of the past grounds my account of Sebald's use of imagery in questioning conventional forms of representation. I argue that Sebald construes the institutionalised constitution of the modern self through civic architecture, emphasising the metonymical associations of contemporary Western life and death. I maintain ultimately that the ethically displaced modern self typifies a culture capable of committing - and simultaneously repressing the representation - of technologised mass genocide: Sebald's texts critique modern society by apprehending modes of intersubjective memory and narrative responsibility through acknowledgement of the arbitrary, indexical capacity of metonymical representation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sebald, Winfried Georg, 1944- -- Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Death in literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Providing statistical inference to case-based software effort estimation</field><field name="creator">Keung, Wai, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a novel approach, called Analogy-X to extend and improve the classical data-intensive analogy approach for software effort estimation. The Analogy-X approach combines the notions of distance matrix correlation found in ecology literature and statistic analysis techniques to provide useful inferential statistics to support analogy-based systems.  Data-intensive analogy for software effort estimation has been proposed as a viable alternative to other prediction methods such as linear regression. In many cases, researchers found analogy outperformed algorithmic methods. However, the overall performance of analogy depends on the dataset quality or relevance of project cases to the target project, and the feature subset selected in the analogy-based model. Unfortunately, there is no mechanism to assess its appropriateness for a specific dataset, in most of the cases analogy will continue to execute regardless of the dataset quality.  The Analogy-X approach is a set of procedures that utilize the principles of Mantel randomization test to provide inferential statistics to Analogy. Inspired by the Mantel correlation randomization test commonly used in ecology and psychology, Analogy-X uses the strength of correlation between the distance matrix of project features and the distance matrix of known effort values of the dataset to assess the suitability of the dataset for analogy, to identify the most appropriate feature subset, and to remove any atypical project cases from the dataset.  The empirical studies show that Analogy-X is capable of: -- Detect extremely outlying project cases that will ultimately distort prediction outcomes using a sensitivity analysis strategy. -- Detect relevant project features that are useful to identify potential source analogues in a stepwise fashion similar to that of stepwise regression. -- Identifying whether analogy-based approach is appropriate for the dataset Analogy-X, thus is a robust solution, provides a sound statistical basis for analogy. It removes the need of using any forms of heuristic search and greatly improves its algorithmic performance. The studies also show that the Analogy-X approach is capable of removing the bottlenecks of performance in data-intensive analogy.  The overall results obtained also suggest that a fully automated data-intensive analogy for software effort estimation can be implemented using the Analogy-X approach, and it is indeed an effective front end to analogy-based systems. The contribution of this work is significant since it provides an approach that will have major impact on the evolution of data-intensive analogy-based and case-based reasoning systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software engineering.</field><field name="subject">Software engineering -- Mathematics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scratch-pad memory management for static data aggregates</field><field name="creator">Li, Lian, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Scratch-pad memory (SPM), a fast on-chip SRAM managed by software, is widely used in embedded systems. Compared to hardware-managed cache, SPM can be more efficient in performance, power and area cost, and has the added advantage of better time predictability. In this thesis, SPMs should be seen in a general context. For example, in stream processors, a software-managed stream register file is usually used to stage data to and from off-chip memory. In IBM's Cell architecture, each co-processor has a software-managed local store for keeping data and instructions.  SPM management is critical for SPM-based embedded systems. In this thesis, we propose two novel methodologies, the memory colouring methodology and the perfect colouring methodology, to place the static data aggregates such as arrays and structs of a program in SPM. Our methodologies are dynamic in the sense that some data aggregates can be swapped into and out of SPM during program execution. To this end, a live range splitting heuristic is introduced in order to create potential data transfer statements between SPM and off-chip memory.  The memory colouring methodology is a general-purpose compiler approach. The novelty of this approach lies in partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file then generalising existing graph colouring algorithms for register allocation to colour data aggregates. In this thesis, a scheme for partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file is introduced. This methodology is inter-procedural and therefore operates on the interference graph for the data aggregates in the whole program. Different graph colouring algorithms may give rise to different results due to live range splitting and spilling heuristics used. As a result, two representative graph colouring algorithms, George and Appel's iterative-coalescing and Park and Moon's optimistic-coalescing, are generalised and evaluated for SPM allocation.  Like memory colouring, perfect colouring is also inter-procedural. The novelty of this second methodology lies in formulating the SPM allocation problem as an interval colouring problem. The interval colouring problem is an NP problem and no widely-accepted approximation algorithms exist. The key observation is that the interference graphs for data aggregates in many embedded applications form a special class of superperfect graphs. This has led to the development of two additional SPM allocation algorithms. While differing in whether live range splits and spills are done sequentially or together, both algorithms place data aggregates in SPM based on the cliques in an interference graph. In both cases, we guarantee optimally that all data aggregates in an interference graph can be placed in SPM if the given SPM size is no smaller than the chromatic number of the graph.  We have developed two memory colouring algorithms and two perfect colouring algorithms for SPM allocation. We have evaluated them using a set of embedded applications. Our results show that both methodologies are efficient and effective in handling large-scale embedded applications. While neither methodology outperforms the other consistently, perfect colouring has yielded better overall results in the set of benchmarks used in our experiments. All these algorithms are expected to be valuable. For example, they can be made available as part of the same compiler framework to assist the embedded designer with exploring a large number of optimisation opportunities for a particular embedded application.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scratch-pad memory.</field><field name="subject">Compiler.</field><field name="subject">Embedded computer systems.</field><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of substance flow analysis, transport and fate of materials in the environment, and environmental risk assessment for provision of information for regional environmental management: cadmium as a case study in Australia</field><field name="creator">Kwonpongsagoon, Suphaphat, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Extraction, production, utilization and disposal of material resources have been undertaken continuously for much of human histories. Unavoidably, all of these activities have disturbed our environment, and subsequently have been harmful to humans and ecosystems in this and future generations. Due to time lag associated with both environment impact and the effects of measures taken to reduce this impact, existing approaches (i.e. monitoring and reacting) do not give sufficiently rapid feedback for effective environmental management. With regard to the complexity and concern related to environment-health chain effects, there is currently no environmental tool or approach that can provide comprehensive information and indicators covering all major environment and health themes, to enable decision makers to make informed judgements about regional policies and plans, relating to the sustainable use and disposal of material resources. Consequently, there is a need for developing a new approach by taking account of a multidisciplinary concept used in this thesis.  Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) has been mainly applied in order to provide input information for Health Risk Assessment (HRA). The SFA approach provides the quantity of the substance that is transported (flows) and stored in the system (stock), and of which sub-system, flow, and process is the greatest concern. The HRA approach provides estimates of human health risk associated with site, activity and facility. An environmental fate and transport model is another key knowledge area incorporated into the HRA process.  An integrating method of SFA, environmental fate and transport, and HRA is developed and illustrated by a case study of cadmium in Australia.  This thesis shows that this new integration of existing stand-alone methods can provide holistic information and useful indicators covering all significant economic activities, environment, flows, and health risk assessment for selected substances. This enables better decision making on the use and disposal of substances at a range of levels in the economy, from corporations to regions and nations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental health.</field><field name="subject">Environmental management.</field><field name="subject">Cadmium -- Environmental aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetic modelling of Fenton-mediated oxidation: reaction mechanism, applications,and optimization.</field><field name="creator">Duesterberg, Christopher Ku, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ever-increasing detection of harmful organic and inorganic compounds in habitable areas throughout the world has led to mounting research into applications and techniques for the treatment of contaminated soils, surface and groundwaters, and chemical and industrial wastewaters. Chemical oxidation technologies, in particular Fenton-based remediation systems, have exhibited considerable potential for the effective treatment and remediation of such contaminated waters and soils.  The use of Fenton-based oxidation systems for the treatment of contaminated waters and wastewaters warrants the development of kinetic models capable of accurately simulating system behaviour. In this thesis, the kinetics of Fenton-mediated oxidation systems and kinetic models based on its governing reaction mechanism are investigated in order to highlight those parameters and conditions that effect Fenton chemistry and oxidation performance, and to demonstrate the application of such kinetic models to design and improve treatment systems.  Experimental and simulated data describing the oxidation of formic acid by Fenton's reagent at low pH (3 to 4) and under a variety of initial conditions, operating regimes, and solution environments supports a proposed reaction mechanism that nominates the hydroxyl radical (OH) as the active oxidizing intermediate in Fenton-based oxidation systems. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that formic acid oxidation is inhibited in the presence of oxygen, and model simulations of these systems reveals that such behaviour is due to the effect organic radical intermediates and/or by-products have in assisting or hindering the redox cycling of the catalytic iron species. The critical role that iron redox cycling plays in affecting oxidation performance is further highlighted by experimental and simulated studies at alternate pHs and using different target organics, including those that react directly with iron in a redox capacity. Experiments at pH 4 reveal an increase in the redox cycling of iron and improved oxidation performance compared to pH 3 as the higher pH favours the superoxide radical, a stronger reductant than the hydroperoxyl radical that predominates at pH 3. Other laboratory and modelling studies on the Fenton-mediated oxidation of certain aromatic compounds highlight the manner in which quinone and quinone-like compounds, being added directly or generated as oxidation by-products, can improve oxidation performance via redox reactions with iron. Further simulations reveal the type of practical design and operating information kinetic models can provide for treatment processes, though it is noted an appropriate understanding of the oxidation mechanism of the target species is necessary for the accurate application of the model.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water -- Purification -- Oxidation.</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- Pollution.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Pollution.</field><field name="subject">Environmental chemistry.</field><field name="subject">Soil remediation -- Oxidation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional studies of transcription factors GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 in Megakaryocyte development.</field><field name="creator">Pan, Shu, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transcription factors GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 are essential proteins for normal megakaryopoiesis, however, the detailed analyses of their functions within developmental stages of megakaryopoiesis are lacking. In my thesis, over expression of gene in target cells was adopted as the main strategy to study the biological functions of these proteins, therefore, an efficient gene delivery method was first developed by using retrovirus.This approach was then utilized to over express GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 in murine leukemia M1 cells and mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and their effects on different developmental stages of megakaryopoiesis were investigated. In the transduced M1 cells, enforced expression of GATA-1 and Fli-1 was found to induce the megakaryocytic development, which was associated with the formation of megakaryocyte (Mk) and the increased expression of Mk specific genes c-Mpl and GPIX. In the transduced mouse HSCs, it was found that the expression of endogenous GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 was up-regulated throughout Mk differentiation; enforced expression of these transcription factors led to the significantly enhanced Mk development. Megakaryocytes over expressing GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 were characterized by the increased expression of various Mk-specific genes including GPIX, c-Mpl, platelet factor 4 (PF4), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and NF-E2, an important transcription factor for terminal megakaryopoiesis; however, GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 displayed the different abilities in promoting the proliferation of hematopoietic cells and MK differentiation, as well as regulating other transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis. To further elucidate the role of the functional domains of Fli-1, various mutants of Fli-1 were also over expressed in mouse HSCs. The results demonstrated that first, the combination of the activation domain of Fli-1 and its Ets domain is required for early megakaryopoiesis but not sufficient for terminal megakaryopoiesis; second, DNA binding of Fli-1 was not the only requirement for early Mk enhancement, moreover, the interaction between Fli-1 and GATA-1 through the Ets domain and the resultant transcriptional synergy was the essential determinant for Fli?1 ability in Mk development. Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis provided strong in vitro evidence that GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 indeed play the critical roles in normal megakaryopoiesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Megakaryocytes.</field><field name="subject">Stem cells -- Research -- Animal models.</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Biotechnology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic soil-structure interaction analysis using the scaled boundary finite-element method.</field><field name="creator">Bazyar Mansoor Khani, Mohammad H, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development of a reliable and efficient technique for the numerical simulation of dynamic soil-structure interaction problems in anisotropic and nonhomogeneous unbounded soils of arbitrary geometry. Such a technique is indispensable in the seismic analysis of large-scale engineering constructions and, to my best knowledge, does not exist at present. The theoretical framework of the research is based on the scaled boundary finite-element method. The following advances are achieved:  The scaled boundary finite-element method is extended to simulate the dynamic response of non-homogeneous unbounded domains. The scaled boundary finite element equations in the frequency and time domains are derived for power-type non-homogeneity frequently employed in geotechnical engineering. A high-frequency asymptotic expansion of the dynamic-stiffness matrix is developed. The frequency domain analysis is performed by integrating the scaled boundary finite-element equation in dynamic stiffness. In the time domain, the scaled boundary finite-element equation including convolution integrals is solved for the unit-impulse response at discrete time stations.  A Pad?? series solution for the scaled boundary finite-element equation in dynamic stiffness is developed. It converges over the whole frequency range as the order of the approximation increases. The computationally expensive task of numerically integrating the scaled boundary finite-element equation is circumvented.  Exploiting the sparsity of the coefficientmatrices in the scaled boundary finite-element equation leads to a significant reduction in computer time and memory requirements for solving large-scale problems. Furthermore, lumped coefficient matrices are obtained by adopting the auss-Lobatto-Legendre shape functions with nodal quadrature, which avoids the eigenvalue problem in determining the asymptotic expansion.  A high-order local transmitting boundary constructed from a continued-fraction solution of the dynamic-stiffness matrix is developed. An equation of motion as occurring in standard structural dynamics with symmetric and frequency-independent coefficient matrices is obtained.

The existing rig was fabricated at UNSW for that purpose. Unfortunately the rig was unsuitable because it was unstable at speeds as low as 500 rpm. This occurred because, when designing the rig, the traditional ??-film cavitation boundary model (CBM) was used. Consequently a modified cavitation boundary model (MCBM) was proposed which correctly predicted the instability threshold of the rig. Using the MCBM, new bearings were installed and the modified rig was stable in the required speed range up to 2400 rpm. Two existing computer programs to calculate bearing stiffness and damping coefficients and FFFs were modified for the purposes of this study. In addition, only dynamic components (AC components) of experimental FFFs could be measured accurately. The vertical mean value (DC component) of experimental FFF was approximated to the vertical reaction force and the horizontal DC component of experimental FFF was approximated to zero at each bearing. This thesis concludes that the numerical solution of Reynolds equation to calculate DC components of FFFs in a CGJB is valid with a proper selection of CBM. The agreement of AC components of the FFFs were good with a balanced rotor, but were poor with an unbalanced rotor. The modified CBM is more accurate than the existing ??-film CBMs. The cavity region is important to obtain accurate numerical results and depends on test conditions, bearing dimensions, etc. To design for critical speeds, cavitation pressure could be either oil vapour pressure or atmospheric pressure; however, to design for stability, cavitation pressure should be oil vapour pressure, or even much lower. Two halves of a CGJB carried different loads because of misalignment and different clearances. In addition, reducing length and increasing clearance significantly increased the stability of the rig. Finally, to obtain perfect agreement between numerical and experimental FFFs, short bearings and a smaller clearance ratio are strongly recommended. A special design to measure cavitation pressure is suggested.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluid-film bearings -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Cavitation.</field><field name="subject">Rotors -- Bearings.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical impedance tomography at low frequencies.</field><field name="creator">Noor, Johan Andoyo Effendi, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most EIT machine operates at high frequencies above 10 kHz. Biological systems demonstrate dispersions of electrical impedance characteristics at very low frequencies below 2 kHz due to the presence of membrane surrounding the cells and diffusion polarisation effects.  A study was made on the feasibility of the use of low frequencies in a range of 1.12 Hz to 4.55 kHz in EIT. One high frequency of 77.712 kHz similar to that normally used in common EIT was also used as a comparison. The impedance measurements employed a four-terminal method using the BULFIS, an ultra low frequency impedance spectrometer and used conducting and insulating material as the objects/phantoms.  The results show that the conductance and capacitance of a metal object disperses at frequency range of 0.1 -10 kHz, which is consistent to the electrical properties of a double layer forming at the metal-electrolyte interface similar to the electrical properties of a membrane.  The reconstructed images reveal that at low frequencies the conducting and the insulating bodies were indistinguishable. They appear differently at high frequencies above 4.55 kHz indicating that the use of multi frequency instrumentation in EIT covering the very low frequency range provides information that instrumentation restricted to frequencies above 10 kHz does not supply. While the internal structure of the double layers could not be delineated, the presence of the double layers could be readily detected by the behaviour of the images as the frequency was varied. This has potential for EIT because it might allow the detection of structures from the variation of the images with frequency. This variation with frequency does not occur at the higher frequencies more usually used for EIT.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tomography.</field><field name="subject">Medical imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic manipulation of thermophiles for ethanol production.</field><field name="creator">Riyanti, Eny Ida, School of Biotechnology And Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Potential thermophiles for ethanol production at elevated temperature were compared based on their kinetic performances. T. thermophilus HB27 demonstrated superior kinetics and its growth was not greatly affected when containing the recombinant plasmid pTEV231. Detailed kinetic studies demonstrated that it could utilize glucose and xylose in medium containing 0.5 % (w/v) yeast extract, and could produce low levels of L-lactate, acetate and ethanol. Kinetic evaluation of the newly isolated G. thermoglucosidasius M10EXG showed it could grow on fully defined media and coferment glucose and xylose. G. thermoglucosidasius M10EXG produced higher levels of products (acetate, and L-lactate) at about 2 g/l each, compared to T. thermophilus HB27 although ethanol levels were only 0.1-0.2 g/l in shake flask fermentations under partially aerobic conditions.  Improved conditions for natural transformation of T. thermophilus HB27 were determined. Optimal conditions for electroporation of were: Milli-Q water washing of cells rather than with 10% (v/v) glycerol; an electrical field of 5 kV/cm; cell concentration of 1.4x1010 cells/ml; and a DNA concentration of 500 ng in 40 Fl (125 Fg/ml) which achieved a transformation efficiency of 3x103 transformants /Fg DNA.  The chloramphenicol resistance (cat) and green fluorescence protein (gfp) genes from pCJS10 were cloned into an E. coli -- T. thermophilus shuttle vector (pMK18) as possible selection markers at elevated temperatures. Both genes were expressed in E. coli DH5H and it was demonstrated that gfp expression in E. coli DH5H decreased as temperature increased to 45oC. However following transformation of T. thermophilus HB27, no evidence of expression were found. The pet operon containing adhT (with its promoter) from G.thermoglucosidasius M10EXG and pdc from Z. mobilis Zm4, was cloned into pMK18 and low level expression in E. coli JM109 occurred with some increase in ethanol production. However the pet operon was not expressed in T. thermophilus with pMK18.  For further gene expression studies, a new shuttle vector, pPOPTE (4-5 kb), based on the T. thermophilus plasmid pTEV231 (containing thermostable kanamycin resistance gene) was constructed. pPOPTE was capable of multiplying in both E. coli and T. thermophilus HB27 and demonstrated higher stability and transformation efficiency compared to pMK18.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol as fuel.</field><field name="subject">Thermophilic bacteria.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclic deposition of salt-laden dusts as an explanation of salinisation in a groundwater recharge zone Coleambally irrigation area Riverine plain NSW</field><field name="creator">Bell, Justin Robert William, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Salinisation of the shallow groundwater system has occurred coincident with the development of irrigation in the Coleambally Irrigation Area. Salinisation in irrigation areas has previously been attributed to the evaporative concentration of the water table; however, there are other sources of salt such as the accumulation of rainfall by vegetation and the dry deposition of salt-laden dusts.  A significant store of crystalline gypsum, together with high concentrations of Na, Mg and Confidence limit, was found within the previously unsaturated zone of the Upper Shepparton Formation. The salt store was identified both within and outside of the groundwater mound; therefore evaporative concentration of the water table cannot be the source of salt. The transition from regional groundwater quality, as applied as irrigation to the ground surface, to shallow groundwater quality is simply explained by solubilisation of this salt store in the presence of soil CO2.  Dating of basal palaeochannel sands indicates that the identified salt store, a profile of only 20 m, was accumulated during the last glacial cycle. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the peak in eluate salinity, at approximately 2 m below ground surface, is between 15,000 and 25,000 years old, coincident with the Last Glacial Maximum. The Last Glacial Maximum was a period of significantly enhanced aridity on the Australian continent. It was also found that the peak in eluate salinity coincided with a bi-modal particle size distribution. The bi-modal signature implies that these sediments were subject to the aeolian accession of dusts.  It was found that the contribution of salt from dry deposition of dusts exceeded the contribution from rainfall by at least 1.9 to 11 times during the last glacial cycle. The results of this study imply that salt-laden dusts have, and continue to play an important role in the salinity and sodicity of soils in the Coleambally Irrigation Area and beyond.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil salinization -- New South Wales -- Coleambally.</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- New South Wales -- Coleambally.</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry -- New South Wales -- Coleambally.</field><field name="subject">Irrigation -- Environmental aspects -- New South Wales -- Coleambally.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutant manifesto: a response to the symbolic positions of evolution and genetic engineering within self perception.</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Simon George, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Believing that ideas about evolution and genetics are playing an increasing role in popular conceptions of who we are and what it means to be human, I sought ways to express this through my art. In particular I tried to articulate these notions through figurative sculpture. As the role of figurative sculpture in expressing current ideas about being human has declined in the West, I saw this as a challenge. It was the intent of my Masters program to reposition the sculpted body back within contemporary western cultural contexts. For an understanding of those contexts I relied heavily on my own culturally embedded experience and observations. I took as background my readings of evolutionary inspired literature and linked it with my interpretations of the genetic mythologies so prevalent in recent movies. The result was an image of contemporary humans as multifaceted, yet subservient to their genes. These genes appear to be easily manipulated and the product of technological intervention as much as, if not more than, inherited characteristics.  As part of developing a sculptural form able to manifest this, I investigated some non-western traditions. I used field trips and residencies to research Buddhist and Hindu sculptures of the body and developed an interest in the spatial and conceptual relationships between those bodies.  Through making figurative work in the studio, I came to realise the figures' inadequacy in expressing temporal relationships. As temporal change is a fundamental element of evolution and genetics, I needed to explore this element.  The result was a number of series; groups of works that create their own context of relationships. Not all these groups use sculptures of the body but they evoke the notion of bodies, naturally or technologically hybridised, mutating, transforming, evolving and related to each other generationaly through time.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic engineering in art.</field><field name="subject">Figure sculpture.</field><field name="subject">Body image in art.</field><field name="subject">Human figure in art.</field><field name="subject">Animals, Mythical.</field><field name="subject">Art and society.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Flinders current and upwelling in submarine canyons</field><field name="creator">Arthur, William Craig, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">The continental shelf off South Australia is incised by some of the largest known submarine canyons. Extensive observations of submarine canyons in other parts of the world have shown submarine canyons can result in locally persistent upwelling regions. Along the southern coastline, westward slope currents including anticyclonic eddies and the Flinders Current (FC) can result in favourable conditions for upwelling in the vicinity of these canyons. Little data is available to describe the FC and so we review three global ocean circulation models and their representation of the FC. Though there are considerable differences between the outputs of these three models, this analysis provides a range of potential scales for the structure and transport of the FC. The reasons for the differences between the output of the three models are extensive, but to a first approximation, climatological surface wind stress products are compared. Dynamical descriptions of the flow past submarine canyons are reviewed and in part extended, in particular the vertical scale of the induced motion is estimated as the Rossby height RH. A description of upwelling and downwelling flow incorporating vorticity stretching is also presented. An idealised model of the southern Australian continental shelf and the submarine canyons reveals the circulation is heavily modified by the presence of the canyons, inducing persistent upwelling of dense water onto the downstream shelf. In addition, one prominent feature of the induced circulation ??? a coastal jet ??? is found to be peculiar to flat inner shelf topographies. More realistic topography including a sloped inner shelf results in reduced shoreward transport within the canyon and hence reduced upwelling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geomorphic controls on thermal stratification in the floodplain lakes of the Macdonald River, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Natalie, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines geomorphic processes that impact thermal stratification within floodplain lakes. Previously, thermal stratification was not thought prevalent in these numerous small water bodies, despite being found in small reservoirs. Thermal stratification leads to long term anoxia in the bottom waters and the release of metals and nutrients from the sediments. This can result in water quality problems such as algal blooms (including potentially toxic cyanobacteria), loss of fish habitat and deterioration of wetland habitat.  Four floodplain lakes of the Macdonald River Valley NSW were profiled and tested over 3?? years to assess to what extent, under what conditions, and with what chemical and physical effects, they thermally stratified and destratified. The morphometry, bed facies, vegetation, hydrology and local weather patterns for each lake were also investigated.  Physical and chemical analyses found elevated nutrients in all four lakes and higher concentrations of total phosphorous and total nitrogen in the bottom waters. These results were not dependant on stable thermal stratification and long-term anoxia in the bottom waters. Inflow samples had much higher concentrations of nutrients than the lake samples, so the catchment is the likely source. Samples were analysed for phytoplankton and significant populations of potentially toxic cyanobacteria were present.  Stratification depended upon whether the lake was "sheltered" from wind stirring or from incident radiation, either topographically by steep slopes surrounding the lakes, or by submerged and emergent vegetation. Aquatic vegetation limits the amount of transfer of turbulent kinetic energy from wind shear and the amount of incident radiation received. At one lake, sheltered areas reached temperatures much higher than less sheltered areas. Topographic sheltering can make a difference of up to three degrees Celsius across the lake surface. Destratification depended on wind speed, wind direction and orientation of the lake to the dominant wind direction.  An extension to the classification of fluvial lakes (from Timms 1992) is presented, with further subdivisions to describe the lakes as "sheltered" or "open" and the type of sheltering (vegetation or topography) present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Floodplains -- New South Wales -- Macdonald River Valley.</field><field name="subject">Lakes -- Circulation.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Thermal pollution.</field><field name="subject">Geomorphology -- New South Wales -- Macdonald River Valley.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of abnormal cardiac function in murine models of hypocontractility and hypercontractility</field><field name="creator">Tan, Ju Chiat, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Heart failure has a significant impact on mortality and morbidity. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the third most common cause of heart failure and the most common reason for heart transplantation. Familial DCM is known to be caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding lamins A and C. New methods to enhance cardiac contractility would be beneficial in the treatment or prevention of heart failure. The focus of this thesis was to evaluate the mechanisms of altered contractility in two mouse models: the LMNA knockout model (homozygous, Lmna-/-; heterozygous, Lmna+/-) generated by targeted deletion of the lmna gene, and the model of enhanced contractility due to cardiac alpha1A-adrenergic receptor (???1A-AR) overexpression (A1A1). Previous studies have found altered nuclear-desmin connections in lamin A/C deficient mice. It was proposed that these alterations result in ???defective force transmission???, which leads to DCM. Studies in this thesis have supported this hypothesis. Studies of isolated single cardiomyocytes from mice aged 4-6 weeks demonstrated abnormal cell morphology and contractile dysfunction in Lmna-/- cardiomyocytes, while Lmna+/- cells showed no overt phenotype. Excitation-contraction coupling experiments and forcecalcium studies in skinned fibers excluded altered calcium kinetics as a primary cause of DCM in this model, but there was evidence of reduced sarcomere numbers and reduced sarcomere lengths as a contributor to reduce force generation in Lmna-/- and Lmna+/- mice.  Previous in vivo studies showed that A1A1 mice had enhanced contractility with the absence of hypertrophy. Studies on isolated single cardiomyocytes from A1A1 mice aged 8-12 weeks showed reduced contractility in the absence of ???1A-AR stimulation, but an exaggerated response to ???1A-AR stimulation. In contrast isolated isovolumic Langendorff perfused A1A1 hearts without ???1A-AR stimulation replicated the enhanced contractility observed in vivo. These studies are consistent with down-regulation of contractility due to the hyperactivity of the overexpressed ???1A-AR in vivo, which only becomes evident in isolated cells without ???1A-AR stimulation due to the loss of functional receptor numbers during isolation. Sufficient spontaneously active ???1A-ARs are preserved in the isolated Langendorff heart preparation to ensure maximum contractility driven by increase calcium release.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiography</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Mice as laboratory animals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treating emotion perception deficits following traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">Bornhofen, Cristina, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">While the cognitive disturbances that frequently follow severe TBI are relatively well understood, the ways in which these affect the psychosocial functioning of people with TBI are yet to be determined and have thus received little attention in treatment research. Growing evidence indicates that that a significant proportion of individuals with TBI demonstrate deficits in the perception of affective information from the face, voice, bodily movement and posture. As accurate evaluation of emotion in others is critical for the successful negotiation of social interactions, effective treatments are necessary. Until recently, however, there have been no rehabilitation efforts in this area with TBI groups. The present research aims to redress this absence. The literature on emotion perception deficits in TBI is examined, and a theoretical rationale for intervention is presented. Several lines of research are reviewed which suggest that rehabilitation targeting such deficits is tenable. These include research on emotion perception remediation with other cognitively impaired populations, findings from cognitive neuroscience suggesting the potential for neuronal restoration after brain damage, and the successful applications of remediation techniques, in particular errorless learning and self-instruction, for treating other cognitive deficits in a range of neurological disorders and TBI. Discussion of this research is followed by a description of two randomised controlled trials aimed at improving emotion perception in individuals with TBI. The findings are discussed with reference to useful theoretical models of rehabilitation, learning and emotion perception. Suggestions for future directions of research are outlined together with relevant design issues.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain damage -- Patients -- Rehabilitation.</field><field name="subject">Brain damage -- Complications -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Cognition disorders -- Patients -- Rehabilitation.</field><field name="subject">Affect (Psychology) -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Social perception -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychological tests.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The values shaping Australian asylum policy: a historical and ethical inquiry</field><field name="creator">Palmer, David, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis maps the values that have guided the asylum policy decisions of Australia's political leaders over the past half-century, drawing on archival records and interviews with former immigration ministers and senior public servants. For comparative purposes, it also maps the values shaping the views of asylum among leaders of a supra-national organization (the European Commission) and of a major non-government organization (the Jesuit Refugee Service).  The findings support the view that a culture of control permeates Australian asylum policy decisions, and that the quest for control stems from perceptions of national interest as articulated in immigration and foreign policy. However, beneath this it shows the primary values shaping policy to be nation building and good governance in the case of the Australian leaders, and (European) community building in the case of European Commission leaders.  Building on a 'caring for us, caring for them' conundrum found running through the values of all three groups of leaders, and seeking a secular equivalent to the faith-inspired relational approach of the Jesuit Refugee Service leaders, the thesis explores the contribution an ethics of care might make to asylum policy design, delivery and evaluation. It argues that such an approach, in which care is conceived as a value, process and practice rather than a sentiment or theory, is well suited to the area, especially when refined to provide for the work of empathy and imagination. It concludes by considering the potential implications for Australian asylum policy if an ethics of care were adopted.  The primary goals of the thesis are a better understanding of the issues involved in asylum policy, and the articulation of an ethical approach potentially as engaging of policy insiders as of policy spectators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asylum, Right of -- Government policy -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In black: the performative and transactional objects in death</field><field name="creator">Strati, Susanna, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates particular ways that memorialising and mourning can be made manifest through public commemorative objects and spaces such as memorials and through smaller scale personal mementos. It also examines ways that these physical reminders can act as repositories and markers for memory, and as metaphors for identity. In particular the research is focussed on Traditional Southern Italian customs, reflecting on the ways that keepsakes and the cenotaph can provide allegories for declining cultural practices of Southern Italian migrants in Australia. The data collected for this thesis is based partly on participant observation, and on informal conversations with migrants from Southern Italy, regarding their funerary practices and stories told about the rural areas left behind in Italy.  Research of visual and published material in the area of memorialising and memorial object are examined in order to gain an understanding of the language of death. The thesis also examines the use of Catholic religious objects in what anthropologist Per Binde has coined 'transactional acts', during supplication and remembrance and during times of mourning. An exploration of memorial and memento objects, by contemporary practitioners including Christian Boltanski, Lindy Lee, Julie Blyfield and Maya Lin has also been included. Inclusion of contemporary artists reflects on how memorials continue to play an important role in today's society as well as being integral in reflecting identity and maintaining connections with the past.  Investigation of this genre is expressed through the research document and a body of studio-based research connected to the traditions of Memorialising. The studio research is expressed in the exhibition 'In Black' through the language of Catholic religious objects, memory boxes, personal mementos and cultural signifiers in wax, metal, and installation. These works, as time capsules are filled with significant representations of individuals and events that evoke memories through depictions of life, significant places and words descriptive of time and place.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memorials.</field><field name="subject">Mourning customs in art.</field><field name="subject">Mourning customs -- Italy, Southern.</field><field name="subject">Italy, Southern -- Social life and customs.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Such a longing': black and white children in welfare in New South Wales and Tasmania, 1880-1940</field><field name="creator">Parry, Naomi, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">When the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission tabled Bringing them home, its report into the separation of indigenous children from their families, it was criticised for failing to consider Indigenous child welfare within the context of contemporary standards. Non-Indigenous people who had experienced out-of-home care also questioned why their stories were not recognised. This thesis addresses those concerns, examining the origins and history of the welfare systems of NSW and Tasmania between 1880 and 1940. Tasmania, which had no specific policies on race or Indigenous children, provides fruitful ground for comparison with NSW, which had separate welfare systems for children defined as Indigenous and non-Indigenous. This thesis draws on the records of these systems to examine the gaps between ideology and policy and practice.  The development of welfare systems was uneven, but there are clear trends. In the years 1880 to 1940 non-Indigenous welfare systems placed their faith in boarding-out (fostering) as the most humane method of caring for neglected and destitute children, although institutions and juvenile apprenticeship were never supplanted by fostering. Concepts of child welfare shifted from charity to welfare; that is, from simple removal to social interventions that would assist children's reform. These included education, and techniques to enlist the support of the child's family in its reform. The numbers of non-Indigenous children taken into care were reduced by economic and environmental measures, such as payments to single mothers.  The NSW Aborigines Protection Board dismissed boarding-out as an option for Indigenous children and applied older methods, of institutionalisation and apprenticeship, to children it removed from reserves. As non-Indigenous welfare systems in both states were refined, the Protection Board clung to its original methods. It focussed on older children, whilst allowing reserves to deteriorate, and reducing the rights of Aboriginal people. This cannot simply be explained by race, for Tasmania did not adopt the same response.  This study shows that the policies of the Aborigines Protection Board were not consonant with wider standards in child welfare of the time. However, the common thread between Indigenous and non-Indigenous child removal was the longing of children and their families for each other.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Relocation -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Stolen generations (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Relocation -- Tasmania.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Doulgas Summerland collection</field><field name="creator">Fitzpatrick, Peter Gerard, Media Arts, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Douglas Summerland Collection is a fictional "monographically based history"1.

This thesis investigates a multilayer system for the affinity immobilisation of liposomes and their stability to various applied stresses. In the work presented here an allylamine monomer was used to create plasma coatings that were stable, thin and amine-rich. The aging studies using AFM showed these films to rapidly oxidise on exposure to water. The freshly deposited films were used for further surface modifications, by the covalent grafting of PEG layers of different interfacial densities under the conditions of varying polymer solvation. The AFM was used to measure the interaction forces between the grafted PEG layers and modified silica interfaces. It was found that the polydispersity of the PEG species resulted in bridging interactions of ???brush???-like PEG layers with the silica surface. These interactions were screened minimised by increasing the ionic strength of the solution. Although the densely grafted PEG layers were found to be highly protein-resistant by the XPS and QCM-D some minor protein-polymer adhesions were observed by the AFM.  The densely anchored biotinylated PEG chains served as an optimum affinity platform for affinity-docking of NeutrAvidinTM molecules, which assembled in a rigid, 2-D layer as confirmed by the QCM-D. The submonolayer surface density of NeutrAvidin, as determined by Europium-labelling, was attributed to steric hindrance of the immobilised molecules. The final protein layer enabled specific binding of biotin-PEG-liposomes as a highly dissipative, dense and stable layer verified by tapping mode AFM and QCM-D. We found that these liposomes were also stable under a range of stresses induced by the shearing effects of water, silica probe and HSA layer at increased loads and velocities. The frictional response of the liposome layer also demonstrated the viscoelasticity and stability of these surface immobilised liposomes.

In particular, it considers the role of place on Australian national and cultural identity. This is a timely exercise since 'Australianess' is increasingly cited as a factor in federal government policy development. In order to address such a broad and complex area, the agenda has been limited to three specific locations: the beach, the verandah and the backyard. These sites have been selected first because of their prominent iconic status within the notion of 'Australianess' and, second, because of the underlying functional parallels that unite them. The present thesis contends that, unlike the function-specific sites where identity is neutralised by globalised standards of appearance, behaviour and harsh fluorescent light, the beach, the verandah and the backyard are ambiguous zones of in between that provide escape, shelter as well as spiritual sanctuary. The figures engage with the nominated locations in accordance with the significance, the meanings that they ascribe to that particular site. These meanings, however, vary greatly from person to person and from demographic to demographic, hence, the grasp of a universally binding sense of identity becomes a slippery proposition. National and cultural seity - the way we are and the way we perceive ourselves as a unified collective - is conditional to a number of factors, the most enduring and pervasive of these is the sense of place, the landscape, the way we affect it and, reciprocally, the way it affects us. National and cultural identity is never static, but remains in a state of perpetual evolution. It must be continually re-assessed in order to remain abreast of the cultural palimpsest as successive waves and generations of people from a variety of backgrounds, situations, ideas and forms of expression inscribe notions of self into their immediate environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Figure.</field><field name="subject">Beach</field><field name="subject">Verandah.</field><field name="subject">Backyard.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What are the outcomes and who benefits from the restructuring of the Australian electricity sector?</field><field name="creator">Chester, Lynne, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The last decade has delivered rapid structural change to the Australian electricity sector. The common conceptualisation of the sector's restructuring has been narrowly based around sector-specific regulatory change and the creation of a national electricity market. This thesis argues that such a focus provides an incomplete and inaccurate explanation of the transformation. Three closely interrelated layers of policies and actions embodying the precepts of neoliberalism, and implemented by the state, have driven the sector's transformation. These policies and actions transcend 'electricity-centric' policies and encompass policies which have become systemic to the Australian public sector as well as a third layer which has transformed the prevailing industrial paradigm across all industry sectors.  The drivers of the electricity sector's restructuring --  and the outcomes and beneficiaries arising --  form the core research focus of this thesis. The research task is addressed by using the analytical framework of the French theory of r??gulation. The analysis reveals that the electricity sector has been Australia's second largest contributor of privatisation proceeds, remains dominated by government ownership and has falling levels of foreign ownership. Higher relative wage levels and union membership are also evident as have been job losses and substantial real price increases for households whereas those for business have generally fallen. The purported 'reform' centrepiece, the national electricity market, was found to be increasingly uncompetitive due to its own regulatory regime and market manipulation by government-owned companies. In addition, the sector exhibits a heightened precariousness: an unprecedented financial vulnerability arising from a strong appetite for debt and derivatives and exacerbated by payments to government owners not by new investment in generation capacity; increasing tensions between the nation-state and local-state concerning the national electricity market and compromises with labour; and an exposure to political and financial risks from the sector's global integration. The clear winners from the sector's restructuring are the owners of capital and the state, particularly the local-state, although the sustainability of this situation is questionable. The analysis also generates a number of propositions about the application of r??gulation theory to sector-based research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power production -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Economic aspects -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Privatization -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new multiaxial creep damage model based on the exhaustion of internal energy.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Lawrence Kiam Yam, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The creep of materials is a research topic of major significance in the life assessment and design of many modern engineering components of advance technology such as: power generation plant, chemical plant, gas turbines, jet engines, spacecrafts, components made of plastics and polymers, etc. To predict the creep lives of such components, one necessary ingredient is a creep damage model. The current creep damage models are either too cumbersome to be readily employed and/or not sufficiently accurate for practical applications.  This thesis describes a new creep damage model to overcome some of the major shortcomings in current creep damage/life prediction methods. The proposed model is relatively simple and readily applicable to industrial cases yet it is sufficiently accurate. The proposed model assumes that, on a macroscopic level, the energy dissipated in the material may be taken as a measure of creep damage induced in the material. In another words, creep damage is directly proportional to the absorbed internal energy density (IED), i.e., the internal energy per unit of volume. In this way, the model takes into account both multiaxial loading and deformation. The model is formulated when the creep constitutive relationships may be expressed by primary plus steadystate or steady-state alone (IED-SS) as well as for the cases when the material behaviour includes the creep tertiary region (IED-T).  The proposed model has been verified by applying it to various components for which the experimental creep lives are available from literature including thick/thin cylindrical vessels, notch bars with various notch-root radii and materials, multi-material cross welds bars, and perforated biaxial plates. The predicted creep lives of these components by the proposed model (IED-SS and IED-T) are compared with the experimental results and those obtained by the Reference Stress Method (RSM). It is shown that the maximum errors in relation to the creep lives of the above-mentioned components are: 18% when IED-SS is applied, 38% when IED-T is applied, and 301% when RSM is applied.  To estimate the effects of uncertainties in material data on the predicted creep life, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted. To this end and in relation to Norton creep law, material parameters such as creep stress coefficient and stress exponent are considered. In addition, the sensitivity analysis included the uncertainties related to the uniaxial creep rupture data. As might be expected, the results suggest that the predicted creep life is most sensitive to the creep stress.  Finally, the present research reveals that the proposed model is simple, practical and can be used in conjunction with any commercial finite element code with creep analysis capabilities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials -- Creep.</field><field name="subject">Creep -- Measurement.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial neural nets: a critical analysis of their effectiveness as empirical technique for cognitive modelling.</field><field name="creator">Krebs, Peter Rudolf, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the computational modelling and simulation of physiological structures and cognitive functions of brains through the use of artificial neural nets. While the structures of these models are loosely related to neurons and physiological structures observed in brains, the extent to which we can accept claims about how neurons and brains really function based on such models depends largely on judgments about the fitness of (virtual) computer experiments as empirical evidence. The thesis examines the computational foundations of neural models, neural nets, and some computational models of higher cognitive functions in terms of their ability to provide empirical support for theories within the framework of Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP). Models of higher cognitive functions in this framework are often presented in forms that hybridise top-down (e.g. employing terminology from Psychology or Linguistics) and bottom-up (neurons and neural circuits) approaches to cognition. In this thesis I argue that the use of terminology from either approach can blind us to the highly theory-laden nature of the models, and that this tends to produce overly optimistic evaluations of the empirical value of computer experiments on these models. I argue, further, that some classes of computational models and simulations based on methodologies that hybridise top-down and bottom-up approaches are ill-designed. Consequently, many of the theoretical claims based on these models cannot be supported by experiments with such models. As a result, I question the effectiveness of computer experiments with artificial neural nets as an  empirical technique for cognitive modelling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive neuroscience.</field><field name="subject">Cognition -- Physiology.</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Anatomy.</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="subject">Neurophysiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The making of a general: lost years, forgotten battles' lieutenant general Frank Berryman 1894-1941</field><field name="creator">Dean, Peter John, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the early military career and life of Lieutenant General Sir Frank Berryman from 1894 through to the end of his involvement in the Middle East campaigns. It begins with his family background and education on the outskirts of Melbourne before tracing, in detail, his personal life and military career until the end of 1941. The specific focus of this investigation is not just his military education and his role in the Cyrenaica and Syrian campaigns, but also the development of his personality and character. Personality and character provides a window of insight that not only helps to illuminate Berryman?s performance as an officer and his professional relationships but it also allows for a deeper understanding of this complex individual. This thesis argues that these, the 'lost years' and 'forgotten battles' , are integral to developing an understanding of this exceptional officer. In Berryman we see an important staff officer and commander whose place in Australia's military history has been largely overlooked.  One of the central themes of this work is that Berryman has been misunderstood and misrepresented within the existing historiography. He was one of the most important figures in the Australian Army during the Second World War and it was during the period covered in this thesis that he established his reputation as a commander and staff officer. Key to this investigation, therefore, is the themes of Berryman's developing leadership and culture of command. This work seeks to reveal the nature and experience of a highly successful officer who is also, to a great extent, representative of a generation of permeant Staff Corps officers who have largely been ignored within the genre of Australian military biography.  Ultimately this thesis concludes that Berryman was a central figure in the Australian Army's success in Cyrenaica and Syria. He demonstrated all of the qualities essential for a successful commander and senior officer and it was in these battles and his earlier military and life experiences that set the stage for his exceptional performance and contribution to the success of the Australian Army, not only in the Middle East but also later in the South West Pacific Campaigns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Berryman, Frank, 1894-1941.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Army -- Officers -- History.</field><field name="subject">Generals -- Australia -- Biography.</field><field name="subject">World War, 1014-1918 -- Campaigns -- Middle East.</field><field name="subject">World War, 1039-1945 -- Campaigns -- Pacific Area.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential shaping of public space during pilgrimage: the Alandi-Pandharpur Palkhi</field><field name="creator">Sane, Prajakta, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">Space perceived and experienced through movement presents an interesting array of imagery which blends together to form a comprehensive whole. My thesis explores this dimension of spatial complexity through the public ritual of pilgrimage. This profound and deeply significant human activity connects the individual places to form an integrated sacred network. The practice of pilgrimage has developed over centuries across the globe and continues to grow and influence a huge cross section of society to come together and move en-masse towards religious centres and personal enlightenment.  Public spaces demand a simultaneous co-existence of people, activities and their setting. The phenomenon of pilgrimage is central to the public realm. Its study involves an intricate layering of beliefs, customs, traditions and religion which collectively govern the people-space relationship. The transformation of a space to a place, from static to dynamic, from passive to active occurs during this activity, maintaining the traditional usage while simultaneously evolving as a product of interaction between people, rituals and spaces. In this thesis, I examine the experiential shaping of space which occurs through pilgrims' activities and their impacts on the given urban and architectural conditions.  The research is based on my study of the Alandi-Pandharpur Pilgrimage in India. It is an outcome of my participation in the ritual as, both, an architect and a pilgrim. I focus on the existing public spaces and their spontaneous response to the unplanned activity of the Pilgrimage. The spatial experience transcends the criteria of aesthetics and functionality of a public space to a deeper exploration of human characteristics and convictions. From this perspective, the thesis considers the broader role of designed public spaces, the extent of inclusion of community rituals and their significance in the shaping of built environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pilgrims and pilgrimages.</field><field name="subject">Space (Architecture) -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Space (Architecture) -- Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Space (Architecture) -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Space perception.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human Papillomavirus in human breast cancer and cellular immortalisation</field><field name="creator">Kan, Chin Yi, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a small, double stranded DNA tumour virus. Infection with HPV normally results in formation of warts. Certain types of HPV, such as type -16 and -18, are shown to have a causal role in the development of uterine cervical cancer, and are so called high risk type HPV. Recently, a role of HPV in breast cancer has been suggested, although a causal role for HPVs in human breast cancer is yet to be demonstrated. The first part of this study investigates the association of HPV with human breast cancer. The results demonstrate that 48% of breast cancers that occurred in Australian women are HPV positive and they are mainly variants of HPV-18. Further analysis shows that HPV positive breast cancer patients are significantly younger than HPV negative patients, suggesting infection with HPV increases the risk of breast cancer development. This is coincidental with increased risk of HPV infection in sexually active young women and provides evidence that HPV has a role in breast cancer development.  The second part of this project investigates the mechanisms by which high risk type HPV oncogenic protein E6, transforms primary human foreskin keratinocytes (natural host cells of HPV). HPV E6 is always expressed in HPV positive cervical carcinoma and results in the degradation of the cellular tumour suppressor protein p53. It is generally believed that HPV E6 contributes to HPV transformation by degradation of p53 protein which leads to cellular immortalisation ? an early step in tumorigenic transformation. Subsequent studies, however, indicate that HPV E6 possesses other functions (such as induction of telomerase activity) which may also be involved in cellular immortalisation. The results of my investigations demonstrate: 1) that degradation of p53 protein is required but is insufficient to immortalise primary cells; 2) that HPV E6 induced telomerase activity is coincidental with an increase in cell culture passage number; 3) that multiple functions of high risk type HPV E6 protein are required for cellular immortalisation.  This finding suggests HPV infection is associated with early onset of breast cancer and that multiple functions of high risk type HPV E6 protein are involved in cellular immortalisation. Further study in both of these areas should provide alternative diagnostic markers, leading to prevention and treatment strategies for HPV positive breast cancer and other cancers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human papillomavirus.</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Cellular immortalisation.</field><field name="subject">Papillomaviruses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fully coupled fluid flow and geomechanics in the study of hydraulic fracturing and post-fracture production</field><field name="creator">Aghighi, Mohammad Ali, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work addresses the poroelastic effect on the processes involved in hydraulic fracturing and post-fracture production using a finite element based fully coupled poroelastic model which includes a triple system of wellbore-fracture-reservoir. A novel numerical procedure for modeling hydraulic fracture propagation in a poroelastic medium is introduced. The model directly takes into account the interaction of wellbore, hydraulic fracture and reservoir in a fully coupled manner. This allows realistic simulation of near fracture phenomena such as back stress and leak-off. In addition, fluid leak-off is numerically modeled based on the concept of fluid flow in porous media using a new technique for evaluating local pressure gradient. Besides, the model is capable of accommodating the zone of reduced pressure (including intermediate and fluid lag zones) at the fracture front so as to capture the behavior of fracture tip region more realistically. A fully coupled poroelastic model for gas reservoirs has been also developed using an innovative numerical technique. From the results of this study it has been found that fracture propagation pressure is higher in poroelastic media compared to that of elastic media. Also high formation permeability (in the direction normal to the hydraulic fracture) and large difference between minimum horizontal stress (in case of it being the smallest principal stress) and reservoir pressure reduce the rate of fracture growth. Besides, high pumping rate is more beneficial in elongating a hydraulic fracture whereas high viscous fracturing fluid is advantageous in widening a hydraulic fracture. It has been also shown that rock deformation, permeability anisotropy and modulus of elasticity can have a significant effect on fluid flow in a hydraulically fractured reservoir. Furthermore, it has been shown that long stress reversal time window and large size of stress reversal region can be caused by high initial pressure differential (i.e. the difference between flowing bottomhole pressure and reservoir pressure), low initial differential stress (i.e. the difference between maximum and minimum horizontal stresses) and low formation permeability in tight gas reservoirs. By taking advantage of production induced change in stress state of a reservoir, this study has also shown that a refracture treatment, if carried out in an optimal time window, can lead to higher economic gain. Besides, analysis of stress reversal region has depicted that a small region with high stress concentration in the vicinity of the wellbore could impede refracture from initiating at the desired place. Moreover, re-pressurization of the wellbore can result in further propagation of the initial fracture before initiation or during propagation of the secondary fracture.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oil wells -- Hydraulic fracturing.</field><field name="subject">Oil fields -- Production methods.</field><field name="subject">Gas wells.</field><field name="subject">Hydraulic fracturing.</field><field name="subject">Reservoir oil pressure.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultivated tastes colonial art, nature and landscape in the Netherlands Indies</field><field name="creator">Protschky, Susanne, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">Culitivated Tastes argues for a new evaluation of colonial landscape art and representations of nature from the Netherlands Indies (colonial Indonesia). The thesis focuses on examples from Java, Sumatra, Ambon and Bali during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but also discusses early post-colonial literature. It uses paintings and photography, with supporting references to Dutch colonial novels, to argue that images of landscape and nature were linked to the formation of Dutch colonial identities and, more generally, to the politics of colonial expansion. Paintings were not simply colonial kitsch (mooi Indi??, or 'beautiful Indies', images): they were the purest expression of Dutch ideals about the peaceful, prosperous landscapes that were crucial to uncontested colonial rule. Often these ideals were contradicted by historical reality. Indeed, paintings rarely showed Dutch interventions in Indies landscapes, particularly those that were met with resistance and rebellion. Colonial photographs often supported the painterly ideals of peace and prosperity, but in different ways: photographs celebrated European intrusions upon and restructuring of Indonesian landscapes, communicating the notions of progress and rational, benevolent rule. It is in literature that we find broader discussions of nature, which includes climate as well as topography. Here representations of landscape and nature are explicitly linked to the formation of colonial identities. Dutch anxieties about the boundaries of racial and gender identities were embedded within references to Indies landscape and nature. Inner colonial worlds intersected with perceptions of the larger environment in literature: here the ideals and triumphs associated with Dutch colonial expansion were juxtaposed against fears related to remaining European in a tropical Asian landscape.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art, Colonial -- Indonesia.</field><field name="subject">Cultural landscapes -- Indonesia -- History.</field><field name="subject">Landscape painting, Dutch.</field><field name="subject">Landscape painting -- Indonesia.</field><field name="subject">Colonies in art.</field><field name="subject">Colonies in literature.</field><field name="subject">Imperialism in art.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radioisotope laboratory safety auditing, compliance and associated problems in NSW</field><field name="creator">Bartolo, William Charles Francis, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the modification of the "Safecode" computer-program to monitor the safety of radio-isotope laboratories, and its application to 24 compliance audits in NSW during the period 1999 to 2006.  Additionally, an attempt was made to predict the level of risk to persons working within those laboratories.  Based on the current NSW radiation control legislation and the relevant Australian Standards a comprehensive audit checklist was developed for this project.  Each safety requirement in those documents was used to develop a question, resulting in 187 questions in the checklist.  The questions were grouped into the following seven Topic Elements: Licensing and Registration; Radiation Safety Administration; Personal and Area Monitoring; Dose Limit Compliance; Documentation/Records; RSO/RSC Qualifications and Duties; and Facilities.  A novel feature was the allocation of "weighting factors" to individual questions and Elements.  The computer program facilitated analysis of data and provided output in spreadsheet and graphical form.  .The on-site physical audits were conducted using the project check-list, and were supplemented by discussions with the client's representative.  The results showed significant variation between sites with overall compliance scores ranging from 37% to 94%.  The reasons for this large variation stem from differences in local management regime; the appointment of an RSO at one site; variation in the extent of adoption of relevant codes of practice; and legislative weaknesses.  Further analysis of the data presented legal, advisory and combined scores for each Element for each site; and variations over time.  The graphic displays of the results were appreciated by client management.  The formula developed to predict risk, based on the physical parameters alone, showed little relationship to the total audit scores.  Statistical analysis of the two data groups by correlation coefficient confirmed this general finding.  Development of the formula however served to indicate deficiencies in the Question Set, and the importance of human factors in achieving a high degree of safety.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiochemical laboratories -- Safety regulations -- New South Wales -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Radiochemical laboratories -- New South Wales -- Safety measures -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Radioisotopes -- Safety measures.</field><field name="subject">Radiation -- Safety measures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of microbial Mat communities in meltwater ponds of the McMurdo ice shelf, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Jungblut, Anne Dorothee, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The investigation presented in this thesis examined the microbial and functional diversity of the meltwater ponds Fresh, Orange and Salt Ponds on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, near Bratina Island, Antarctica. These sites were chosen because of the ecological importance and absence of detailed characterisations of their diversity and function as part of Antarctica?s largest wetland. Particular focus was on cyanobacterial diversity, nitrogen fixation and secondary metabolite production. Using 16S rRNA gene and morphological analysis a large diversity of cyanobacteria (more than 22 phylotypes) was identified with high phylogenetic similarities (up to 99% sequence identity) to cyanobacteria from mats in other regions of Antarctica. In addition biogeographical distributions were identified including potentially endemic and cosmopolitan cyanobacteria. High salinities were also connected to the change and reduction of diversity. Lipid marker analyses were performed targeting hydrocarbons, ether-linked hydrocarbons, methylated fatty acid esters (FAME), wax esters, hopanols and sterols. Lipid biomarker profiles were similar to typical cyanobacteria dominated mats with major input from microorganisms including oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs, obligate aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs that conduct the metabolic processes of fermentation, sulphate reduction, sulphate and iron-oxidation, methanogeneses. Signature lipids indicative of Chloroflexus and archaea, as well as branched aliphatic alkanes with quaternary substituted carbon atoms (BAQCs), were identified for the first time in Fresh, Orange and Salt Ponds. Based on nifH gene analysis, the nitrogen fixing diversity characterised in Orange Pond consisted of cyanobacterial Nostoc sp. as well as firmicutes, beta-, gamma- and delta-proteobacteria. Acetylene reduction assays and nifH gene RNA transcript diversity identified Nostoc sp. as a main contributor of nitrogenase activity in these ponds. Furthermore, analytical methods were used to identify the cyanobacterial secondary metabolites microcystins, although the genetic basis for this production and the toxin producer could not been identified. However non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) genes were identified which could be the genetic basis for novel bioactives. The use of a multi-disciplinary approach synthesis and subsequent results significantly increased our understanding of the diversity and function of microbial mat communities in the unique meltwater ponds of the McMurdo Ice shelf, Antarctica.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbial mat communities.</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria.</field><field name="subject">Diversity.</field><field name="subject">Antarctica.</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen fixation.</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacterial toxins.</field><field name="subject">Microcystin.</field><field name="subject">Lipid biomarkers.</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms -- Antarctica.</field><field name="subject">Microbial populations -- Antarctica.</field><field name="subject">Melt ponds -- Ecology -- Antarctica.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The unpublished plays of Miles Franklin</field><field name="creator">Hedley, Jocelyn, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the publication of her novel, My Brilliant Career, in 1901, Miles Franklin became the darling of the Sydney literati. Great things were expected of the little girl from the bush. But five years later, nothing had eventuated; her talent, Miles thought, was barely recognised in Australia. In the hope of gaining greater writing opportunities, she shipped to Chicago where she became involved in social reform. It was hard work and ill paid, and though she bewailed the fact that it sapped her writing energy, she nonetheless felt a commitment to the cause such that she remained for almost a decade.  In her spare time, though, she continued to write -- and not just prose. More and more she wrote for the theatre, attempting to push into a world of which she had always dreamed. Blessed with a beautiful singing voice, she had long desired to be on the stage. This was impossible, though; her voice, she believed, had been ruined by bad training in her youth. To write for the stage, then, though a poor substitute, was at least in the field of her original ideal.  Miles' plays, though, are not remembered today, and are little thought of in scholarship, are considered, in fact, to have failed. This gives the false impression that they were always little thought of. Her correspondence, however, reveals that at least five of the plays were produced, indicating a certain level of success.  Miles Franklin's theatrical work, then, is surely worthy of further examination. This thesis looks at five of the plays in the light of Miles' life and in the light of the society in which she found herself. In turn, it uses the plays to reveal something of the nature of the playwright herself and to show that Miles Franklin's theatrical writing did not fail as once thought. In addition, it provides a complete bibliography of the plays (inclusive of locations), lists the duplications as they appear under alternate titles and provides synopses of a large number. This will make up for a gap in Miles Franklin scholarship and will facilitate other scholars in accessing the plays. This thesis, then, is an introduction to a new facet of Miles Franklin scholarship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian drama -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Franklin, Miles, 1879-1954 -- Dramatic works.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of Darwinism and evolutionism in modern Greek literature: the case of Grigorios Xenopoulos</field><field name="creator">Zarimis, Maria, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">PROBLEMS INVESTIGATED:This thesis responds to a significant gap in modern Greek literary scholarship in relation to the Darwinian, post-Darwinian and other evolutionary theories and ideas in the works of Greek writers. My preliminary investigations show that there have been Greek writers who were influenced by Darwinian ideas. However, histories of modern Greek literature do not include Darwinism as a distinct influence in its own right, instead it only appears within the Greek naturalist school of the late 19th century; even when they discuss naturalist works influenced by evolutionary thought. This thesis primarily examines the Darwinian and post- Darwinian influence in select writings of Grigorios Xenopoulos in the period from 1900 to at least 1930. In doing so it attempts to reassess the status of these works and to argue for their importance in the context of other Greek and non-Greek literature.  PROCEDURES FOLLOWED: This thesis takes on a cross-disciplinary approach drawing on the histories of science and of literature, on the biological sciences and other sciences. So as to establish a context for Xenopoulos' work, I discuss the themes and issues associated with evolutionary ideas and draw on Greek and non-Greek writers from the 19th century first wave of Darwinism to the first decades of the twentieth century.  GENERAL RESULTS: I am able to document that while there appears to have been a general delay in the transmission of Darwinian ideas to Greek creative writers, certain themes in their writings arise, responding to Darwinism, which are common to those of non-Greek writers. While there are differences in the treatments of these themes amongst writers, there are a number of main issues which arise from them which include class, gender and race, and are shown to be important in Greek society at the time. In addition, the direct implications of Darwin's theory of evolution are debated in Greece by science and religion, and are discussed in the writings of Xenopoulos and his peers.  MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: My examination of responses to Darwinism by Xenopoulos in the context of other Greek and non-Greek writers aims, firstly, to emphasise the importance of Xenopoulos and his work as a key literary influence in Greek society at the time; and secondly, to play a part in bringing modern Greek literature into the mainstream of European culture. The responses to Darwinism in literature, fiction and non-fiction, past and present, encompass a fascinating and controversial field of investigation which, in view of our scientific knowledge today, continues to address issues such as the nature-nurture debate, creationism versus evolution and man's place in nature. Hence it is important that literary responses to the Darwinism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Greece be documented as a foundation for present literary responses.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greek literature.</field><field name="subject">Xenopoulos, Gr&#275;gorios, 1867-1951.</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology) in literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43897</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fibre-optic sensing technology and applications in civil engineering.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Allan Chi-Lun, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the research and industry-related works carried out from the development of a fibre-optic strain sensor system for Civil Engineering applications. A sensor system consists of a number of core components, including the sensing element, interrogation/demodulation, multiplexing, signal processing and hardware equipment. In the process of development, a number of issues have been identified and investigated, which resulted in the improvement of the system performance, as well as the proposal of new techniques for the sensor system. First, an improved demodulation technique for a type of sensor, namely the fibre Fizeau interferometer (FFI), is presented. The technique is based on the improvement of the Fourier transform peak detection method, which suffers severely from the poor resolution and accuracy of finding the sensor cavity length. The improvement over the original method has been compared and verified through simulations and experiments. Second, a simultaneous demodulation technique for multiplexed FFI and fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed. Third, a multiplexing technique using amplitude-modulated chirped FBGs and the DWT is proposed. These two proposed techniques have been demonstrated experimentally through strain measurements. The strain resolution, crosstalk and limitations are investigated. In addition, simultaneous quasi-static strain and temperature sensing of different metal plates are performed. Fibre-optic sensors have found numerous applications in different areas. In this thesis, the use of FBG sensors in Civil Engineering applications is demonstrated in four experimental studies, including: (i) long-term measurement of drying shrinkage and creep of structural grade concrete; (ii) simultaneous measurement of shrinkage and temperature of reactive powder concrete (RPC) at early-age; (iii) measurement of coefficients of thermal expansion of cement mortar and RPC; and (iv) field-trial on the strain monitoring of the world?s first RPC road bridge. In addition, the experimental and practical issues of using FBG sensors are considered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical fiber detectors.</field><field name="subject">Fiber optical.</field><field name="subject">Diffraction gratings.</field><field name="subject">Strain gages.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity and systematics of marsupial lions from the Riversleigh world heritage area and the evolution of the Thylacoleonidae</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Anna K, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The fossil record of marsupial lions (family Thylacoleonidae) from Australian Oligo Miocene deposits is generally poor. Study of new material of this family collected from Oligo-Miocene limestone sediments of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland adds significant new information about previously described species and also indicates a greater diversity of thylacoleonids during this period of geological time. Two new genera and five new species are described. Reassessment of the holotype of the type species of Priscileo, P. pitikantensis,indicates it shows stronger affinities to species of the genus Wakaleo than it does to Priscileo roskellyae. Priscileo is regarded here to be a junior synonym of Wakaleo. The cranium and lower dentition of Priscileo roskellyae show significant morphological differences from species of Wakaleo, and this species is referred to a new genus, Lekaneleo. Distinctive morphological differences are identified in the M3s of Wakaleo oldfieldi and W. vanderleueri, species previously distinguished only by relative size differences in their dentitions. Functional morphological assessment of postcranial remains of species of Wakaleo suggests that they were probably scansorial or arboreal, but does not support a previous hypothesis of a fossorial habit. Cladistic analyses of the interrelationships of marsupial lions support the referral of Priscileo pitikantensis to the genus Wakaleo. The monotypic genus Microleo is the sister-group to all remaining thylacoleonid taxa. Species of Lekaneleo are the sistergroup to a Wakaleo/Thylacoleo clade. Intraordinal relationships of thylacoleonids were also investigated. Phylogenetic analyses of the interrelationships of Diprotodontia that included representatives of all extinct vombatiform families as well as extant taxa were conducted employing cranial and dental morphological characters. These analyses provide support for the hypothesis that Thylacoleonidae are members of the suborder Vombatiformes. Two species of Wakaleo (W. oldfieldi and W. vanderleueri) present in Riversleigh deposits are also found at other localities - respectively, the Leaf Locality of central Australia (Kutjamarpu LF) and the Small Hills Locality of northern Australia (Bullock Creek LF) - and suggest age estimations of the relevant Riversleigh sites of early Miocene and late Miocene. The phyletic evolution of Wakaleo suggests that some Riversleigh deposits are probably late Oligocene in age.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thylacoleonidae.</field><field name="subject">Marsupials, Fossil -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maturation of the transient chromatic (L-M) visual evoked potential: insights from linear and nonlinear analysis.</field><field name="creator">Boon, Mei Ying, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Psychophysical and electrophysiological techniques have shown that chromatic contrast sensitivity improves between infancy and adolescence. In adults, electrophysiological and psychophysical methods usually agree. However, in infants electrophysiological techniques may underestimate ability to see chromatic contrast (Suttle et al., 2002). It is not known if the discrepancy between electrophysiological and psychophysical methods continues during childhood nor whether the chromatic VEP can be used as an indicator of colour perception in children.  Purpose: To investigate the transient L-M chromatic visual evoked potential and its ability to indicate perception (psychophysical thresholds) of chromatic stimuli in children and adults. In particular, to determine whether a discrepancy between VEP and psychophysical L-M thresholds exists during childhood and if so, to gain some understanding about the nature of the discrepancy.  Methods: Transient chromatic VEPs were recorded in children (aged 4.5-13 years) and adults (aged 20-40 years). VEP thresholds were compared with psychophysical thresholds (within-subjects comparison). Because the VEPs of the children were less intra-individually repeatable in morphology than those of the adults, post-hoc objective analysis of the VEPs, linear (Fourier) and nonlinear dynamical (Grassberger and Procaccia's (1983) correlation dimension) analyses, was conducted.  Results: VEP and psychophysical estimates of chromatic contrast thresholds agreed using a variety of methods in the adults. In the children, however, the objective methods of assessment (extrapolation from Fourier-derived amplitudes and the correlation dimension) were more accurate than the methods that employed subjective evaluations of VEP morphology.  Conclusion: The L-M transient chromatic VEPs of both children (aged 4.5-13 years) and adults appear to contain chromatic information, even in the absence of repeatable VEP morphology and should therefore be able to indicate chromatic perception (psychophysical thresholds). However, the chromatic information may be present as a nonlinear dynamical signal, which may require objective methods (Fourier analysis, the correlation dimension) to reveal the chromatic signal. The greater intra-individual variability of VEP morphology in children compared to adults may reflect poorer precision when switching between cortical states in children's brains. Alternatively, interactions between the immature visual system of the children and their general EEG may occur. Children's VEPs should therefore be interpreted differently to adult VEPs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Color vision.</field><field name="subject">Visual evoked response.</field><field name="subject">Evoked potentials (Electrophysiology)</field><field name="subject">Phychophysiology -- Methodology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc oxide TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) and polycrystalline silicon thin-films for photovoltaic applications</field><field name="creator">Song, Dengyuan, Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-films are very promising for application in photovoltaics. It is extremely challenging to develop cheap TCOs and poly-Si films to make photovoltaic devices. The aim of this thesis is to study sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO TCO and poly-Si films by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) for application in low-cost photovoltaics. The investigated aspects have been (i) to develop and characterize sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) films that can be used as a TCO material on crystalline silicon solar cells, (ii) to explore the potential of the developed ZnO:Al films for application in ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, (iii) to make and characterize poly-Si thin-films on different kinds of glass substrates by SPC using electron-beam evaporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) [referred to as EVA poly-Si material (SPC of evaporated a-Si)], and (iv) to fabricate EVA poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass and improve the energy conversion efficiency of these cells by post-crystallization treatments. The ZnO:Al work in this thesis is focused on the correlation between film characteristics and deposition parameters, such as rf sputter power (Prf), working gas pressure (Pw), and substrate temperature (Tsub), to get a clear picture of film properties in the optimized conditions for application in photovoltaic devices. Especially the laterally non-uniform film properties resulting from the laterally inhomogeneous erosion of the target material are investigated in detail. The influence of Prf, Pw and Tsub on the structural, electrical, optical and surface morphology properties of ZnO:Al films is discussed. It is found that the lateral variations of the parameters of ZnO:Al films prepared by rf magnetron sputtering can be reduced to acceptable levels by optimising the deposition parameters.  ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells are fabricated and characterized to demonstrate the feasibility of the fabricated ZnO:Al films for application in heterojunction solar cells. In this application, expensive indium-tin oxide (ITO) is usually used. Under the standard AM1.5G spectrum (100 mW/cm2, 25 ??C), the best fabricated cell shows an open-circuit voltage of 411 mV, a short-circuit current density of 30.0 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 66.7 %, and a conversion efficiency of 8.2 %. This is believed to be the highest stable efficiency ever reported for this type of cell. By means of dark forward current density-voltage-temperature (J-V-T) measurements, it is shown that the dominant current transport mechanism in the ZnO:Al/c-Si solar cells, in the intermediate forward bias voltage region, is trap-assisted multistep tunneling. EVA poly-Si thin-films are prepared on four types of glass substrates (planar and textured glass, both either bare or SiN-coated) based on evaporated Si, which is a cheaper Si deposition method than the existing technologies. The textured glass is realized by the UNSW-developed AIT process (AIT = aluminium-induced texture). The investigation is concentrated on finding optimized process parameters and evaluating film crystallization quality. It is found that EVA poly-Si films have a grain size in the range 0.8-1.5 ??m, and a preferential (111) orientation. UV reflectance and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a high crystalline material quality, both at the air-side surface and in the bulk. EVA cells are fabricated in both substrate and superstrate configuration. Special attention is paid to improving the Voc of the solar cells. For this purpose, after the SPC process, the samples receive the two post-crystallization treatments: (i) a rapid thermal anneal (RTA), and (ii) a plasma hydrogenation. It is found that two post-crystallization treatments more than double the 1-Sun Voc of the substrate-type cells. It is demonstrated that RTA improves the structural material quality of the cells. Furthermore, a hydrogenation step is shown to significantly improve the electronic material quality of the cells. Based on the RTA???d and hydrogenated EVA poly-Si material, the first mesa-type EVA cells are fabricated in substrate configuration, by using sputtered Al-doped ZnO as the transparent front contact. The investigation is focused on addressing the correlation between the type of the substrate and cell performance. Optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the devices are characterized. It is found that the performance  of EVA cells depends on the glass substrate topography. For cells on textured glass, the AIT texture is shown to have a beneficial effect on the optical absorption of EVA films. It is demonstrated that a SiN barrier layer on the AIT-textured glass improves significantly both the crystalline quality of the poly-Si films and the energy conversion efficiency of the resulting solar cells. For cells on planar glass, a SiN film between the planar glass and the poly-Si film has no obvious effect on the cell properties. The investigations in this thesis clearly show that EVA poly-Si films are very promising for poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zinc oxide</field><field name="subject">polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">thin films.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monsters in our minds : the myth of infanticide and the murderous mother in the cultural psyche</field><field name="creator">Scher, Ingrid Lana, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">If, as author Toni Morrison believes, we tell stories about what we find most terrifying, then our cultural narratives suggest an overwhelming preoccupation with the murderous mother ??? the monster in our minds. This dissertation examines some of the most powerful and enduring stories told about the murderous mother and considers how these stories are shaped by the unconscious fears and fantasies that dominate the cultural psyche. Revolving around the idea of infanticide as an ???imaginary??? crime, this dissertation uncovers the psychoanalytic foundations of the obsessive telling and consumption of stories of maternal child-murder in Western culture and contends that infanticide narratives can be read as symptoms of psychocultural dis(-)ease. Underlying all stories about the murderous mother is an unconscious fear of infanticide and fantasy of maternal destructiveness that is repressed in the individual psyche. These fears and fantasies are expressed in our cultural narratives. Chapter 1 examines fairytales as the literary form that most clearly elaborates individual fears and psychic conflict and locates the phantasmic murderous mother within psychoanalytic narratives of individuation. Chapter 2 shows how individual fears and fantasies of maternal monstrosity are transferred to society and revealed in the myths through which our culture is transmitted. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the particular neuroses of ancient Greek society and early modern culture and consider stories of the murderous mother that most powerfully reflect anxieties of maternal origin and fantasies of maternal power. Chapters 5 and 6 shift to a contemporary setting and consider stories that reveal, in differing ways, how the murderous mother haunts the cultural psyche. Examining a variety of texts and drawing material from a spectrum of disciplines, including law, literature, criminology, theology, philosophy, and medicine, this dissertation concludes that it is only by exposing the underpinnings of our cultural stories about the murderous mother that we can hope to break free from the unconscious attitudes that imprison us. Emerging from this study is an original and important theoretical framework concerning conceptualisations of infanticide, the ways in which we imagine maternal child-murder and the limits of that imagination, and how we might escape the murderous maternal monster buried deep in the labyrinths of the mind.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infanticide</field><field name="subject">mothers</field><field name="subject">folklore</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">mythology</field><field name="subject">women murderers</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">archetype</field><field name="subject">archetypes in civilization</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis and culture</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis and folklore</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scanner data and the construction of price indices.</field><field name="creator">Ivancic, Lorraine, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores whether scanner data can be used to inform Consumer Price Index (CPI) construction, with particular reference to the issues of substitution bias and choice of aggregation dimensions. The potential costs and benefits of using scanner data are reviewed. Existing estimates of substitution bias are found to show considerable variation.  An Australian scanner data set is used to estimate substitution bias for six different aggregation methods and for fixed base and superlative indexes. Direct and chained indexes are also calculated. Estimates of substitution bias are found to be highly sensitive to both the method of aggregation used and whether direct or chained indexes were used. The ILO (2004) recommends the use of dissimilarity indexes to determine the issue of when to chain. This thesis provides the first empirical study of dissimilarity indexes in this context.  The results indicate that dissimilarity indexes may not be sufficient to resolve the issue. A Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) index provides an approximate estimate of substitution-bias-free price change, without the need for current period expenditure weights. However, an elasticity parameter is needed. Two methods, referred to as the algebraic and econometric methods, were used to estimate the elasticity parameter. The econometric approach involved the estimation of a system of equations proposed by Diewert (2002a). This system has not been estimated previously. The results show a relatively high level of substitution at the elementary aggregate level, which supports the use a Jevons index, rather than Carli or Dutot indexes, at this level. Elasticity parameter estimates were found to vary considerably across time, and statistical testing showed that elasticity parameter estimates were significantly different across estimation methods.  Aggregation is an extremely important issue in the compilation of the CPI. However, little information exists about  'appropriate' aggregation methods. Aggregation is typically recommended over 'homogenous' units. An hedonic framework is used to test for item homogeneity across four supermarket chains and across all stores within each chain. This is a novel approach. The results show that treating the same good as homogenous across stores which belong to the same chain may be recommended.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scanner data.</field><field name="subject">Consumer price index.</field><field name="subject">Inflation.</field><field name="subject">Elasticity of substitution.</field><field name="subject">Aggregation.</field><field name="subject">Consumer price indexes -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Consumer price indexes -- Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Price indexes -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Price indexes -- Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Prices -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Prices -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="subject">Scanning systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enigma of appearances: photography of the third dimension</field><field name="creator">Fiveash, Tina Dale, Media Arts, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Enigma of Appearances is an examination into the medium of three-dimensional photography, with particular focus on the technique of stereoscopy. Invented in the mid-Victorian era, stereoscopy was an attempt to simulate natural three-dimensional perception via a combination of optics, neurology, and a pair of dissimilar images. Whilst successful in producing a powerful illusion of spatial depth and tangibility, the illusion produced by stereoscopy is anything but ??natural??, when compared to three-dimensional perception observed with the naked eye. Rather, stereoscopic photography creates a strange and unnatural interpretation of three-dimensional reality, devoid of atmosphere, movement and sound, where figures appear frozen in mid-motion, like waxwork models, or embalmed creatures in a museum. However, it is precisely stereoscopic photography??s unique and enigmatic interpretation of three-dimensional reality, which gives it its strength, separating it from being a mere ??realistic?? recording of the natural world.  This thesis examines the unique cultural position that stereoscopy has occupied since its invention in 1838, from its early role as a tool for the study of binocular vision, to its phenomenal popularity as a form of mass entertainment in the second half of the 19th century, to its emergence in contemporary fine art practice in the late 20th and 21stt centuries. Additionally, The Enigma of Appearances gives a detailed analysis of the theory of spatial depth perception; it discusses the dichotomy between naturalia versus artificialia in relation to stereoscopic vision; and finally, traces the development of experimental studio practice and research into stereoscopic photography, undertaken for this MFA between 2005 and 2007. The resulting work, Camera Mortuaria (Italian for ??Mortuary Room??), is a powerful and innovative series of anaglyptic portraits, based upon an experimental stereoscopic technique that enables the production of extreme close-up three-dimensional photography. Applying this technique to the reproduction of the human face in three-dimensional form, Camera Mortuaria presents a series of ??photo sculptures??, which hover between reality and illusion, pushing the boundaries of stills photography to the limit, and beyond.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stereoscopic photography.</field><field name="subject">3-d photography.</field><field name="subject">3d photography.</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional photography.</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging.</field><field name="subject">Fiveash, Tina -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="subject">Stereoscopy.</field><field name="subject">Anaglyph.</field><field name="subject">Anaglyptic photography.</field><field name="subject">Stereography.</field><field name="subject">Photography, Stereoscopic -- History.</field><field name="subject">Portrait photography -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Australians -- Portraits.</field><field name="subject">Photography, Artistic -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of cognitive biases on information searching and decision making.</field><field name="creator">Lau, Annie Ying Shan, Centre for Health Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research is possibly the first study investigating the impact of cognitive biases on information searching and decision making. Set in the context of making health-related decisions, this research tests the hypotheses that (i) people experience cognitive biases during information searching; (ii) cognitive biases can be corrected during information searching; and (iii) correcting for biases during information searching improves decision making. Using a retrospective data analysis, a Bayesian model and a series of prospective empirical experiments, the cognitive biases investigated are anchoring effect, order effects, exposure effect and reinforcement effect.  People may experience anchoring effect, exposure effect and order effects while searching for information. A person???s prior belief (anchoring effect) has a significant impact on decision outcome (P &amp;lt 0.001). Documents accessed at different positions in a search journey (order effects) and documents processed for different lengths of time (exposure effect) have different degrees of influence on decision making (order: P = 0.026; exposure: P = 0.0081).  To remedy the impact of cognitive biases, a series of interventions were designed and trialled to test for their ability to modify the impact of biases during search. A search engine interface was modified to allow for a document-level intervention, which attempts to debias order effects, exposure effect and reinforcement effect; a decision-focussed intervention for debiasing the anchoring effect; and an education-based intervention to inform users about the biases investigated in this research. Evaluation of these alterations to the search interface showed that some of the interventions can reduce or exacerbate cognitive biases during search. Order effects are no longer apparent amongst subjects using a keep document tool (i.e. order debiasing intervention) (P = 0.34); however, it is not associated with any significant improvement in decision accuracy (P = 0.23). Although the anchoring effect remains robust amongst subjects using a for/against document tool (i.e. anchor debiasing intervention) (P &amp;lt 0.001), the intervention is marginally associated with a 10.3% increased proportion of subjects who answered incorrectly pre-search to answer correctly post-search (P = 0.10). Overall, this research concludes with evidence that using a debiasing intervention can alter search behaviour and influence the accuracy and confidence in decision making.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making.</field><field name="subject">Information behavior.</field><field name="subject">Cognition.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Southern quest: a play and said and done: verbal and non-verbal information in contemporary theatrical writing.</field><field name="creator">Lozano, Carlos Enrique, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">My critical essay maps out the relationship between verbal and non-verbal information in contemporary theatrical writing.  It uses Lehmann's theory of a post-dramatic theatre and Pfister's analytical input to investigate different configurations of the information given by the characters' speech and the information given by their physical actions.  The ways in which these variables interrelate define the type of affiliation between theatre and drama in any given text.  My essay contends that the verbal and the non-verbal represent the two ends of the spectrum of possibilities of any written theatre text.  The predominance of one over the other will determine the extent to which the 'presence' of the dramatist intervenes in the staging of the work.  Using Old Times as a case study, I examine the way in which Pinter stretches the gap between the verbal and the non-verbal; by using his knowledge of the stage, he confronts the remoteness of the literary in theatrical writing.  My play Southern Quest recognizes the minds of the readers and of the spectators as the place where the closure of the gap occurs.  Its stage directions make of the stage, the properties and actions a creation that is parallel to the fictional one (only present in the dialogue of the characters).  There is a permanent discrepancy, not a contradiction, between what is said and what and where it is done that demands that the actual assembly of the possible fiction takes place in the receiver's mind.  The creative component draws on numerous elements analysed in the critical work, such as the discordance between the verbal and the non-verbal and the use of narrative monologues in theatrical writing.  The lack of agreement between the verbal and the non-verbal-a heightened discordance at the beginning and the end of the play, with a minimal discrepancy towards the centre-mirrors the characters' journey throughout the play: from existential doubt to physical agony and back.  The theoretical concerns addressed in the essay are explored in the writing of the play and my main formal drive in the creative piece is to explore the division between theatre and drama from within the text.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drama -- Technique.</field><field name="subject">Theater -- Semiotics.</field><field name="subject">Semiotics and literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of some statistical and economic models involving exchange rates.</field><field name="creator">Buncic, Daniel, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation is concerned with the examination of some widely employed nonlinear exchange rate models. In particular, its aim is to assess how well non-linear statistical models accommodate the theoretical implications contained in economic models and how well they are able to capture the empirical properties of the data.  Chapter 2 gives a brief background to the concept of PPP and discusses the role of transaction costs in economic models, making it necessary to model exchange rates within a non-linear framework. Parametric as well as non-parametric statistical techniques are applied to a long time-series data set to give an indication of the empirical validity of non-linearity in real exchange rates. Wide threshold bands are found to be a common characteristic of real exchange rate data.  Chapter 3 studies the fitness of the ESTAR model for real exchange rate modelling. It is shown that wide threshold bands in the empirical data necessitate a small transition function parameter in the exponential regime weighting function, leading to difficulties in the meaningful interpretation of regimes. When this occurs, it is also shown that the ESTAR model is weakly identified over the range of the sample data that one generally works with. These results are illustrated on an empirical data set by replicating the often cited study of Taylor et al. (2001).  In Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 a number of non-linear models are evaluated. Simulation experiments indicate that LM style tests that are commonly employed in the literature to test for ESTAR non-linearity have a very low probability of rejecting the false null hypothesis of linearity when the true data generating process is in fact the ESTAR model of Taylor et al. (2001). It is further shown that, contrary to the claims of the recent study by Rapach and Wohar (2006), long-horizon forecasts from the ESTAR model converge to the unconditional mean of the series, so that there is no gain in utilising the ESTAR model for long-horizon forecasts. Studying the Markov switching model of Bergman and Hansson (2005) reveals that the model does not generate any non-linearity as predicted from economic models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign exchange rates -- Econometric models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the name of emancipation? Interrogating the politics of Canada?s human security discourse.</field><field name="creator">??zg????, Umut, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Canada has actively incorporated human security into its foreign policy framework ever since the first articulation of human security in the 1994 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Annual Report. The Canadian Government has been at the forefront of promoting the concept internationally, thereby identifying Canada as one of the leading 'humanist-activist' states. This thesis, however, takes a more skeptical approach towards the emancipatory claims of Canada's human security discourse. It argues that, despite its overarching humanistic tone, the question of who is secured through the language and operationalization of human security remains problematic. In examining Canada's human security discourse in reference to this central question, this thesis analyses the promotion and operationalization of human security within Canada and abroad. The central argument of this thesis is that with its overwhelmingly statist and liberal language, Canada's interpretation of human security is far from being a challenge to the traditional ontological claims of security as being the provider of political order. The Canadian human security agenda is driven by a traditional fear of national insecurity. It aims to secure national unity and identity in Canada, and its national and economic security abroad, by promoting the ideals of liberal democratic peace. Drawing upon the insights of critical security studies and post-structuralist approaches to international relations, this thesis reveals several meaning-producing effects of Canada's human security discourse. First, domestically, it perpetuates the truth claims of the discourse of Canadian identity by naturalizing the idea of Canadian goodness. Canada's human security discourse enhances the social control of the population by masking 'human insecurities' within Canada. Second, by framing 'failed' and 'fragile' states as a threat to Canadian security and liberal international order, the Canadian Government perpetuates the constant struggle between the zones of peace and the zones of chaos, and overcodes human security with simultaneously a statist and universalist language that aims to control as well as emancipate the 'borderlands' Third, while Canadian discourse on human security claims to encourage a bottom-up approach to security, it works ironically as an elitist policy which endorses an ideal form of governance in Canada and abroad.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human rights -- Canada.</field><field name="subject">Civil rights -- Canada.</field><field name="subject">Narional security -- Canada.</field><field name="subject">Canada -- Foreign relations.</field><field name="subject">Security, International -- Canada.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vision-based navigation and decentralized control of mobile robots.</field><field name="creator">Low, May Peng Emily, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis documents experimental investigation into the use of vision for wheeled robot navigation problems. Specifically, using a video camera as a source of feedback to control a wheeled robot toward a static and a moving object in an environment in real-time. The wheeled robot control algorithms are dependent on information from a vision system and an estimator.  The vision system design consists of a pan video camera and a visual gaze algorithm which attempts to search and continuously maintain an object of interest within limited camera field of view. Several vision-based algorithms are presented to recognize simple objects of interest in an environment and to calculate relevant parameters required by the control algorithms. An estimator is designed for state estimation of the motion of an object using visual measurements. The estimator uses noisy measurements of relative bearing to an object and object's size on an image plane formed by perspective projection. These measurements can be obtained from the vision system.  A set of algorithms have been designed and experimentally investigated using a pan video camera and two wheeled robots in real-time in a laboratory setting. Experimental results and discussion are presented on the performance of the vision-based control algorithms where a wheeled robot successfully approached an object in various motions.  The second part of this thesis investigates the coordination problem of flocking in multi-robot system using concepts from graph theory. New control laws are presented for flocking motion of groups of mobile robots based on several leaders. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the control laws and its applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robot vision.</field><field name="subject">Mobile robots.</field><field name="subject">Autonomous robots.</field><field name="subject">Robots -- Control systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painting by eye: an investigation into the representation and understanding of dimensions and space through objects, images and time</field><field name="creator">Alice, Abi, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Finding equilibrium in forms, colour-form combinations and images has long been a concern of mine. I recognise a persistent manner of working within my art practice that utilises geometry, mathematics and colour to arrive at compositions that have a sense of beauty and equilibrium.  Abstraction has been of significant interest to me and the three collections of work that I developed during my Master of Fine Arts studies - 'Colour:Form:Ratio', 'Photography-Free Zone' and 'Construction-Abstraction' -  illustrate the different ways I have applied my interests in abstraction.  Until the completion of the 'Colour:Form:Ratio' painting series my approach to abstraction was cerebral and self-reliant. While I was satisfied with results of my initial investigations and experimentation with abstract forms in painting I felt that the work lacked a social connection. I thus became interested in addressing what I perceived as this shortfall in my abstract painting.  A new  body of photographic work that had been evolving in parallel to my painting practice seemed to offer a solution. I realised that the photographs could be used to construct a new version of abstract composition. The images shared a similar colour and geometrical configuration to that illustrated in the 'Colour:Form:Ratio' Series. With this breakthrough, I began 'painting by eye', replacing my brush and palette with the camera and using it to capture and frame colours and geometric forms from my surrounding environment. In order to test my new methodology of arriving at abstract compositions extracted from the world around me, I selected two communally shared  spaces - the gallery/museum and the construction site - as the sourcing ground for my photographs. The result of my experimentation has been two collections of work: 'Photography-Free Zone' and 'Construction-Abstraction'. Both series reflect my experience of the gallery/museum space and the construction site while illustrating the transferral of my painting process to the photographic medium. The most favourable realisation I made in the process of making these works was that the subject matter I captured with the camera possessed aesthetic and theoretical qualities in keeping with my former painted artistic vocabulary, despite being removed from the physical act of painting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space (Architecture)</field><field name="subject">Visual perception.</field><field name="subject">Painting, Abstract</field><field name="subject">Painting -- Technique.</field><field name="subject">Composition (Art)</field><field name="subject">Geometry in art.</field><field name="subject">Alice, Abi.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volatile sulfur compounds in coastal acid sulfate soils, northern N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">Kinsela, Andrew Stephen, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cycling of biogenic volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) within marine and terrestrial ecosystems has been shown to play an integral role in atmospheric chemistry; by influencing global climate change through the creation of cloud condensation nuclei and controlling acid-base chemistry; as well as influencing sediment chemistry including the interactions with trace metals, particularly regarding iron sulfide formation. Despite this, the examination of VSCs within Australian coastal acid sulfate soils (ASS) is an unexplored area of research. As ASS in Australia occupy an area in excess of 9 M ha, there is a clear need for a greater understanding of the cycling of these compounds within such systems.  This thesis looks at the concentrations of several VSCs within agricultural and undisturbed ASS on the east coast of Australia. Initial measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) were made using passive diffusion samplers, which were followed by two detailed field-based studies looking at the concentrations and fluxes of both SO2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) using flux-gradient micrometeorological techniques. These novel results indicated that this agricultural ASS was a substantial source of atmospheric H2S (0.036-0.056 gSm-2yr-1), and SO2 (0.095-0.31 gSm-2yr-1), with flux values equating to many other salt- and freshwater marshes and swamps. The flux data also suggested that the ASS could be a continual source of H2S which is photo-oxidised during the daytime to SO2. Measurements of both compounds showed separate, inverse correlations to temperature and moisture meteorological parameters indicating possible contributing and / or causal release factors. Further identification of these and other VSCs within ASS samplers was undertaken in the laboratory using gas chromatography in combination with solid-phase microextraction. Although SO2 and H2S were not discovered within the headspace samples, two other VSCs important in atmospheric sulfur cycling and trace metal geochemistry were quantified; dimethylsulfide (DMS; &amp;gt 300??g/L) and ethanethiol (ESH &amp;gt 4??g/L).  The measurements of H2S, DMS and ESH are the first quantifications with Australian ASS, and they may be important for refining regional or local atmospheric sulfur budgets, as well as interpreting previous SO2 emissions from ASS. Ultimately this thesis further enhances our understanding of the cycling of VSCs within acid sulfate systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sulphur compounds -- Environmental aspects -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Sulphur dioxide -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen sulphide -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Soil acidity -- Australia -- North Coast (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case for a uniform statutory general anti-avoidance rule in Australian taxation legislation</field><field name="creator">Tooma, Rachel Anne, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Taxpayer certainty is the most frequently cited argument against statutory General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAARs).  However the vast literature criticising statutory GAARs fails to consider the extent of taxpayer uncertainty, and the potential for taxpayer uncertainty, in jurisdictions without a statutory GAAR.  This thesis examines that gap in the literature.  The thesis uses inductive reasoning to suggest that there is greater taxpayer certainty where a statutory GAAR exists and is appropriately administered.  Specifically, it uses a case study to demonstrate that there is greater uncertainty for taxpayers where the administration, the judiciary and the legislature may use their vast powers to address perceived avoidance.  The thesis then considers the form of a statutory GAAR that may best be expected to promote taxpayer certainty.  Such analysis involves a comparison of Australia???s oldest statutory GAAR, Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (and its predecessor section 260), with the more recent GAARs in Australia???s indirect tax legislation (GST and state stamp duty), and the GAARs of other jurisdictions, including New Zealand, Canada and South Africa.  In order to promote taxpayer certainty, a uniform statutory GAAR is ultimately proposed for all Australian taxation legislation, with safeguards to ensure the appropriate administration of the uniform GAAR.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taxation -- Law and legislation -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Income tax -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic microbial risk assessment and management implications for urban water supply systems</field><field name="creator">Signor, Ryan S., Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Urban drinking-water supplies are still implicated as pathways for the transmission of waterborne disease. A move toward risk informed, proactive water system management has occurred over the past decade and is advocated in current international drinking water guidelines. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) is a tool with potential for aiding health risk management; however the refinement of scientific based practical methods to support that philosophy still requires development. This thesis focused on the water utility, its responsibility to manage microbial water safety, and how probabilistic QMRA may aid in developing management strategies. A framework for waterborne disease risk assessment from urban supply systems was derived and tested on an Australian case study. The main premise was that, in order for risk assessment outcomes to inform the management process, the steps should incorporate the concepts of risk variability, the explicit event conditions that can drive it, and that examination of QMRA sensitivity to various risk scenarios/model uncertainties is undertaken. The identified management uses were: (i) prioritising for attention issues hampering the system's ability to meet or the assessor's ability to interpret against (e.g. knowledge gaps about the system), a water quality health target; and (ii) identifying potential strategies or control points for addressing those issues. Additionally, rarely occurring, high impact, adverse fluctuations in treated water quality (and consumer infection risks), especially from source water contaminant "peaks", are highly, nearly totally, influential over the extent of risks averaged over longer, say annual, periods. As such, a case is made calling for widespread adoption of health targets that refer to tolerable consumer risks per exposure, rather than or as well as the current common practice of expressing targets in terms of risks from exposure over a year or lifetime. Doing so may provide incentive and opportunities for improved management, and the future derivation of specific microbial treatment or treated water quality targets, with a view toward protecting the community from extreme high risk periods associated with disease outbreaks.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urban water supply systems.</field><field name="subject">water utility.</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical and biological modification of porous silicon photonic crystals.</field><field name="creator">Kilian, Kristopher, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Porous silicon (PSi) photonic crystals have aroused research interest as label-free chemical and biological sensing transducers owing to the ease of fabrication, high quality optics and a sensitive optical response to changes in efractive index. A major impediment to using PSi materials as sensors is the relative instability of the silicon surface to oxidation in ambient air and aqueous environments. This thesis reports methods for derivatising PSi towards realisation of 1-D silicon-based photonic materials for applications in biology and medicine.  Narrow-linewidth rugate filters, a class of photonic crystal, are fabricated on silicon to display a high reflectivity resonant line in the reflectance spectrum. The position of the resonance is sensitive to changes in refractive index, thus allowing quantification of infiltrating biological species. The efficacy of rugate filters as biosensing transducers requires 1) protection from aqueous degradation, 2) resistance to non-specific adsorption and  3) distal reactivity for coupling of biorecognition molecules. Two chemical strategies based on hydrosilylation of functional alkenes are compared for stabilising the PSi structure against oxidation whilst resisting non-specific adsorption of biomolecules.  Immobilisation of peptides to the organic layers is demonstrated for optical detection of protease enzymes. Introduction of protease results in cleavage of the immobilised peptides within the rugate filters, detected by an optical blue-shift to shorter wavelengths. To increase the sensitivity to proteolysis, covalent mmobilisation of biopolymers is evaluated using gelatin as a model substrate. Digestion of gelatin is detected down to 37 attomoles of protease. Furthermore, the surface chemistry allows specific capture of live cells and incubation with stimulated macrophages in tissue culture results in optical detection of released gelatinase enzymes.  The generality of the surface chemistry allows for a range of other biological applications to be investigated. An alternative biorecognition interface, hybrid lipid bilayer membranes, containing specific recognition elements for cholera toxin allows optical detection of affinity capture and concentration within the PSi. In addition, the suitability of chemically modified photonic crystals as reservoirs for mass spectrometry is evaluated towards biomolecule quantification after optical detection. A robust and flexible surface chemistry on PSi photonic crystals is critical to performance in a range of biological assays and a necessary requirement for wide-scale employment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemical engineering.</field><field name="subject">Porous silicon.</field><field name="subject">Photonic crystals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical programming approaches to the plastic analysis of skeletal structures under limited ductility.</field><field name="creator">Tangaramvong, Sawekchai, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a series of integrated computation-orientated methods using mathematical programming (MP) approaches to carry out, in the presence of simultaneous material and geometric nonlinearities, the realistic analysis of skeletal structures that exhibit softening and limited ductility. In particular, four approaches are developed. First, the entire structural behavior is traced by using the nonholo-nomic (path-dependent) elastoplastic analysis. Second, the stepwise holonomic anal-ysis approximates the actual nonholonomic behavior by using a series of holonomic counterparts. Third, the more tractable holonomic (path-independent) analysis is implemented to approximate the overall nonholonomic response. Finally, classical limit analysis is extended to cater for this class structures; the aim is to compute in a single step ultimate load and corresponding deformations, simultaneously.  The nonholonomic, stepwise holonomic and holonomic state formulations are developed as special instances of the well-known MP problem known as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP). Geometric nonlinearity is tackled via two alternative approaches, namely one that can cater for arbitrarily large deformations and the second for 2nd-order geometry effects only. The effects of combined bending and axial forces are included through a (hexagonal) piecewise linear yield locus that can accommodate either perfect plasticity or isotropic softening or hardening.  The extended limit analysis problem is formulated as an instance of the challenging class of so-called mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs). Two classes of solution approaches, namely nonlinear programming (NLP) based approaches and an equation based smoothing approach, are proposed to solve the MPEC.  A number of numerical examples are provided to validate the robustness and efficiency of all proposed methods, and to illustrate some key mechanical features expected of realistic frames that exhibit local softening behavior.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plastic engineering (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Programming (Mathematics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV/AIDS natural history and treatment in the Asia-Pacific region: the treat Asia HIV observational database.</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Jialun, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines HIV disease natural history and response to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in patients from The TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD), a mulitcentre, prospective observational cohort of HIV-infected patients from countries in the Asia-Pacific region.  By September 2005, 2979 patients have been recruited to TAHOD from 15 participating sites. The majority were male (73%), median age 37 years. Chinese (37%), Thai (25%) and Indian (17%) were the main ethnicities. Most patients reported HIV infection through heterosexual (59%) and homosexual contact (23%); 5% injecting drug use. At baseline, 41% of patients were diagnosed with AIDS defining illness, and 77% were being treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  Baseline and retrospective data suggest that the overall response to HAART in TAHOD is similar to that seen in western cohorts, with mean CD4 count increase of 115 cells/&#956;L and 69% achieving a viral load less than 400 copies/mL six-month after HAART initiation. Baseline CD4 count was the strongest predictor of short-term disease progression. Prognostic models based on routine clinical data and haemoglobin gave a good estimation of disease progression. The rate of new AIDS defining illness was 26% in the first 90 days after HAART initiation, which may partly be due to immune reconstitution syndrome occurring shortly after treatment. The most frequently used first-line ART combination was stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Approximately 22% of patients receiving this treatment changed or stopped at least one drug in the first year, with adverse effect (including lipodystrophy, hepatitis, rash and peripheral neuropathy) the major reasons. The rates of discontinuation of efavirenz or nevirapine as part of HAART were similar (16 vs. 20/100 person years). Older age and positive HCV antibody were associated with an elevated liver function (ALT) test. Both prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfection with HIV were approximately 10%. The impact of hepatitis coinfection on immunological and virological responses to ART and HIV disease progression was not statistically significant. Both HBV and HCV remained independently associated with elevated ALT in the multivariate models.  The overall HIV disease progression and response to ART in TAHOD patients were similar to those seen in the western countries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Diagnosis -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Diagnosis -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Treatment -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Treatment -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Asia -- Statistics -- Databases.</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Asia -- Statistics -- Databases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface plasmons for enhanced thin-film silicon solar cells and light emitting diodes</field><field name="creator">Pillai, Supriya, School of Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Photovoltaics (PV) is fast emerging as an attractive renewable energy technology due to concerns of global warming, pollution and scarcity of fossil fuel supplies. However to compete in the global energy market, solar cells need to be cheaper and more energy efficient. Silicon is the favorite semiconductor used in solar photovoltaic cells because of its ubiquity and established technology, but due to its indirect bandgap silicon is a poor absorber and light emitter. Thin film cells play an important role in low cost photovoltaics, but at the cost of reduced efficiencies when compared to wafer based cells. There remains much untapped potential in thin-film solar cells which this work has attempted to exploit through exploring novel approaches of enhancing the efficiency of thin film cells using the optical properties of sub-wavelength metal nanoparticles. Metals are considered as strong absorbers of light because of their large free-electron density. How can metals improve light trapping in solar cells? This question has raised several eyebrows and this thesis is an attempt to show that metal nanoparticles can be useful in producing efficient solar cells.  Subwavelength metal particles support surface modes called surface plasmons when light is incident on them, which cause the particles to strongly scatter light into the underlying waveguide or substrate, enhancing absorption. The process of coupling thin film silicon waveguide modes to plasmonic metals using unpolarised light at normal incidence is applied to silicon-based solar cells and light emitting diodes, and enhanced photocurrent and electroluminescence is realized with potential for further optimisation and improvement. The results from this study correspond to a current increase of up to 19% from planar wafer based cells and up to 33% increase from 1.25 micron thin-film silicon-on-insulator structures for the AM1.5 global spectrum. We also report for the first time an up to twelve fold increase in electroluminescence signal from 95nm thick light-emitting diodes. From the results we conclude that this method which involves simple techniques of nanoparticle deposition and characterization could hold important implications in the improvement of thin-film silicon cell absorption / emission efficiencies where conventional methods of light trapping are not feasible, resulting in promising near-term applications of surface plasmons in photovoltaics and optoelectronics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plasmons (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Solar cells -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Thin film devices.</field><field name="subject">Silicon.</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles.</field><field name="subject">Light emitting diodes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forging diplomacy: a socio-cultural investigation of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the "Art of Australia 1788-1941" exhibition</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Louise Frances, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study is an historical investigation exploring the impact of the Carnegie Corporation's philanthropic cultural and educational activities in North America and Australia during the 1940s. The author examines the Carnegie's formation of public values and perceptions using cultural and aesthetic material in order to transmit American ideological ideals with the goal of influencing Australian, Canadian and USA cultural norms. The principal case examined in the paper is the "Art of Australia 1788-1941" exhibition, which toured the USA and Canada during 1941-42. Scrutiny of the exhibition uncovers the role it played in alliance building and the promotion of a range of cultural and political agendas. The investigation deploys a theoretical framework derived from the writings of Tony Bennett. The framework takes the form of a matrix that uses concepts of institutionalized agencies/power and individual agencies/knowledge detailed in a nine-cell matrix composed of propositional statements under the intersecting categories of culture, technologies, ethics, zones, objects, and visualization.  The "Art of Australia" Exhibition is a paradigmatic case of the instrumental, cultural application of exhibitions in the interest of the state, using government and non-government, public and private organizations as intermediaries. The analysis reveals the existence of diverse agendas and power/knowledge relationships between governments, corporations and the exhibition. This account highlights the museum as a significant arena for establishing and legitimating social norms and practices whilst steering cultural values. Such actions sponsored by government and entrepreneurial philanthropy are analyzed and interpreted as an early instance of building civic values and promoting the public belief in shared national identity. In this sense the investigation explores the educational mission of the museum and it's supporting agencies in the broadest public context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carnegie Corporation of New York.</field><field name="subject">Art of Australia 1788-1941 (Exhibition) 1941-1942.</field><field name="subject">Art -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Art and society.</field><field name="subject">Intercultural communication.</field><field name="subject">Art -- Study and teaching.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using markets to implement energy and environmental policy. Considerations of the regulatory challenges and lessons learned from the Australian experience and laboratory investigation using experimental economics</field><field name="creator">Nolles, Karel, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Government is constantly attempting to balance the competing interests within society, and is itself active in a variety of different roles. The conflict between these roles becomes particularly clear when an attempt is made to implement a "regulatory market" - that is a market that exists only because of government action- such as an electricity or environmental market - to implement some policy objective, since it is the nature of markets to candidly reveal weaknesses that in a non-market management framework may have remained hidden for some time. This thesis examines the difficulty that government has in setting market rules that implement an efficient market design for such markets. After examining the history and development of the Australian Electricity Industry market reform process, we examine more closely some of the electricity related environmental markets developed specifically to drive a policy outcome in Australia -- in particular the Australian Mandatory Renewable Energy Target Market (MRET) and the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme. By comparing these environmental markets with established financial markets, and using the techniques of experimental economics, we show that these environmental markets have significant inefficiencies in their design. We argue that these come about because lessons from the financial markets have not be learned by those implementing environmental markets, that stakeholders are lobbying for market design characteristics that are not in fact in their own best interests, and that governments struggle to manage the divergent pressure upon them. For example, in MRET we show experimentally that one of the market design characteristics most fought for by generators (the ability to create renewable energy certificates from qualifying energy without declaring the certificates to the market until a later time of the creator's choosing) in fact leads to market volatility, and ultimately inefficiently low prices. We also examine the impact on the overall MRET market of simple rule changes upon market performance.  Key conclusions of this thesis are that it is more difficult than has been appreciated to successfully use a market to implement public policy and that important lessons have not yet been learned from the existing financial markets.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy policy -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Environmental policy -- Economic aspects -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises -- Government policy -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Competition -- Government policy -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical studies on FeoB- a transmembrane iron transporter from Escherichia coli</field><field name="creator">Thambiraj, Solomon Rajesh, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Integral membrane proteins perform a wide range of biological processes, including respiration, signal transduction and molecular transport.

I find the three-day cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) to be negative and significant around government announcement of the reform on 29 April 2005, but the three-day CAR around company???s announcement of the reform to be positive and significant. I attribute this change of sentiment by the market to the release of information about the reform process concerning features such as type and level of consideration. I also regress the company???s CAR on the type and level of consideration and find evidence to suggest that type of consideration matters, where investors prefer payment of shares from capital reserves or retained profits, cash, warrants or any combination of these methods as opposed to payment of shares from non-tradable shareholders. However, I observe no relation between level of consideration and CAR. I interpret this reaction to be that investors perceive that the consideration level is fair and reasonable based on the company???s financial and operating conditions.

Where N-N was bpm 31 or bim 32 and there was no alternate counterion present, bimetallic complexes formed containing the counterion X= [Cp*MCl3]-. The three dimensional, solid state, structures of the cationic fragments of the bimetallic complexes [Cp*MCl(N-N)][X] (M= Ir, X= [Cp*IrCl3]-, N-N= bpm 31 and bim 32; M= Rh, X= [Cp*RhCl3]-, N-N= bpm 31; M= Ir, X= BF4 -, N-N= bim 32, mesBIAN 38 and mesim-mim 63) are presented. Abstraction of the chloride, in complexes of the type [Cp*IrCl(N -N)]BF4, by AgBF4 created active catalysts in situ with the best catalyst in the series for the hydroamination of 2-(2-phenylethynyl)aniline [Cp*IrCl(mesBIAN)]BF4/AgBF4.  Investigations performed into the synthesis of N-(2-methylvinyl)-2-phenylindole catalysed by [IrCp*Cl2]2/BF4- have shown that the most likely potential mechanism proceeds via the initial catalysed formation of the imine followed by metal promoted cyclisation. The isolation of the complex [IrCl2(2-(2-phenylethynyl)aniline)Cp*] and investigation into its reactivity showed it to be a potential reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycle. Investigation into catalysed C-C bond formation of N-propargylindole identified the in situ generated complex [Rh(CO)2Cl]2/PPh3 as a catalyst for the generation of pyrroloquinoline as a 1:1 mixture of regioisomers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heterocyclic chemistry.</field><field name="subject">Catalysts.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameter estimation using a genetic algorithm for complex catchment modelling systems.</field><field name="creator">Fang, Tianjun, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Implementation of physically distributed catchment modelling systems reshapes the fundamental philosophy of traditional calibration approaches by supporting the concept of equifinality. Arising from the concept of equifinality, alternative behavioural parameter sets within a given catchment modelling system structure can generate similar levels of simulation performance. This concept is motivated by the existence of a variety of uncertainties associated with a complex catchment modelling system, such as an imperfect model structure, measurement errors in both the input data and the recorded flows, and unknown, or poorly defined, interactions among parameters. However, the difficulty of searching for behavioural parameter sets increases as the complexity of the catchment modelling systems increases.  This study undertook an investigation on the feasibility and robustness of a real-value coding genetic algorithm (GA) for calibrating the physically distributed Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) using the Centennial Park catchment in Sydney as a case study. It was found that a real-value coding GA was a robust technique suitable to search for behavioural parameter sets and, in particular, it was found that this approach was capable of identifying the promising range of values for spatially variable parameters.  Moreover, the widespread use of physically distributed catchment modelling systems has highlighted the importance of estimating the uncertainty in the parameter values and in the predictions obtained from a complex catchment modelling system as well as in catchment averaged, or lumped, systems that have been the focus of many previous studies. Bayesian inference has been shown to be a tool suitable for parameter uncertainty estimation in catchment modelling. However, the application of Bayesian inference faces difficulties in complex high-dimensional systems where there is little if any a priori knowledge about the proposal distribution of the parameters.  In this study, a real-value coding GA was used to undertake uncertainty estimation on spatially variable control parameters with little a priori knowledge about the proposal distribution of parameters. After 50,000 evaluations, the marginal posterior distributions of spatially variable parameters which are associated with behavioural parameter sets were identified. The performance of a behavioural parameter set under a range of hydrological conditions was evaluated. Updating of the marginal distributions of these control parameters was implemented by adding additional calibration data.  Interactions among the spatially variable control parameters were investigated also. Results based on the Pearson Correlation method indicate no clear relationship between any two control parameters. However, a methodology to detect relationships among groups of parameters was developed. Application of this methodology suggests that the simulation performance of SWMM was influenced by combinations of parameter values rather than values of the individual parameters.  Finally, the predictive uncertainty associated with the existence of behavioural parameter sets was considered. A number of alternative strategies were used to evaluate the predictive performance. Consideration of the results suggests that use of a small number of parameter sets randomly selected from the large number of behavioural parameter sets was the best strategy in terms of efficiently obtaining predictive performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Distribution -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Water quality -- Management -- New South Wales -- Centennial Park.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge based anomaly detection</field><field name="creator">Prayote, Akara, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Traffic anomaly detection is a standard task for network administrators, who with experience can generally differentiate anomalous traffic from normal traffic. Many approaches have been proposed to automate this task. Most of them attempt to develop a sufficiently sophisticated model to represent the full range of normal traffic behaviour. There are significant disadvantages to this approach. Firstly, a large amount of training data for all acceptable traffic patterns is required to train the model. For example, it can be perfectly obvious to an administrator how traffic changes on public holidays, but very difficult, if not impossible, for a general model to learn to cover such irregular or ad-hoc situations.   In contrast, in the proposed method, a number of models are gradually created to cover a variety of seen patterns, while in use. Each model covers a specific region in the problem space. Any novel or ad-hoc patterns can be covered easily. The underlying technique is a knowledge  acquisition approach named Ripple Down Rules. In essence we use Ripple Down Rules to partition a domain, and add new partitions as new situations are identified. Within each supposedly homogeneous partition we use fairly simple statistical techniques to identify anomalous data. The special feature of these statistics is that they are reasonably robust with small amounts of data. This critical situation occurs whenever a new partition is added.  We have developed a two knowledge base approach. One knowledge base partitions the domain. Within each domain statistics are accumulated on a number of different parameters. The resultant data are passed to a knowledge base which decides whether enough parameters are anomalous to raise an alarm. We evaluated the approach on real network data. The results compare favourably with other techniques, but with the advantage that the RDR approach allows new patterns of use to be rapidly added to the model.  We also used the approach to extend previous work on prudent expert systems - expert systems that warn when a case is outside its range of experience. Of particular significance we were able to reduce the false positive to about 5%.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer networks -- Security measures.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks -- Access control.</field><field name="subject">Computer security.</field><field name="subject">Data protection.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of platinum, iridium, and hafnium to nickel-aluminium alloys under cyclic oxidation conditions.</field><field name="creator">Kartono, Rahmat, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A thermally grown oxide (TGO) such as the alumina scale formed on a bondcoat enhances the oxidation and corrosion resistance of thermal barrier coating (TBC)- bondcoat-superalloy substrate systems. As the external alumina scale lies between the thermal barrier coating and bondcoat, its first spallation and subsequent TBC delamination become critical. Once the external alumina scale spalls, it will spall together with the TBC, leaving the system with no temperature barrier protection. Operational factors such as thermal cycling conditions, water vapour in the oxidation atmosphere, and alloying elements comprising the bondcoat system affect alumina scale adherence. Another problem that arises for the majority of bondcoat systems, &#946; (Ni,Pt)Al and MCrAlY (M=Metal), are rich in aluminium. This causes aluminium to diffuse into the substrate, enriching it with aluminium during service, transforming phases in the substrate alloying system.  The purpose of this study was to develop bondcoat materials that promote formation of a strongly adherent TGO, but have an aluminium content near the substrate composition. Cyclic oxidation experiments were performed with Ni-Al, Ni-Pt-Al, and Ni-Pt-Al-Ir alloys in dry air and air-12%H2O. Thermal cycles of 1 hr at 1200OC and 10 minutes at 80OC were carried out in flowing gases at a total pressure of 1 atm. Experiments in N2- 12%H2O were performed only on Ni-Al binary alloys. Binary Ni-Al cast alloys were tested for fundamental study purposes, while Ni-Pt-Al and Ni-Pt-Al-Ir cast alloys were intended to be models for aluminide coatings, with attention focused on &#947;+&#947;' -Ni-(20 to 23)Al.  Comparisons were made with &#946;-Ni-50Al, as it forms an external alumina scale and was found to have the smallest weight loss rate during testing of binary alloys. Assessments of Pt and Pt-Ir additions, with and without hafnium, to the &#947;+&#947;' binary alloy were made. Compared to binary alloys, platinum was found to reduce the total weight loss caused by scale spallation. Experiments in air-12%H2O led to more rapid weight loss than in dry air. This was due to enhanced spallation. However, the degradation rate was slower than in platinum-free alloys exposed to the same atmosphere.  Partial replacement of platinum with iridium was found to improve alloy scale adherence during exposure in both dry and wet air. Addition of 1wt% hafnium was found to reduce oxide thickness and increase the oxide adherence simultaneously. The hafnium addition was essential in order to reduce spallation rate in wet air.  Water vapour in the presence of oxygen generally increased the spallation rate. It weakened the oxide metal interface, causing subsequent spallation to be increased, but only if the gas had access to the alloy-scale interface. Water vapour did not affect the spallation rate of the strongly adherent oxide grown on Ni-22Al-30Pt+1wt%Hf and Ni- 20Al-15Pt-10Ir+1wt%Hf.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sealing compounds.</field><field name="subject">Nickel-aluminum alloys.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public health approaches to measurement, surveillance and the promotion of walking among Australian adults</field><field name="creator">Merom, Dafna, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the importance of walking to public health. The first part is characterized by epidemiological research. First, a typology for the measurement of walking is developed. A systematic review is conducted of observational studies to determine the health benefits of walking in its own right. Studies consistently confirm that 30 minutes walking on most days of the week is sufficient to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and non-communicable disease risk. Then, a series of epidemiological analyses describes the prevalence and correlates of walking, using multiple health and non-health surveillance data sets. Surveillance data indicate that the prevalence of walking at the above recommended levels is low across all domains. Between 1991 and 2001 an increase in walking occurred, and was the main contributor to reductions in leisure time physical inactivity; however, the proportion of the population who achieved the recommended amount of physical activity by walking did not change in leisure and transport domains. The next part of the thesis is characterized by health promotion research examining the impact of three population-based approaches to increasing walking among Australian adults. The first was an evaluation of a conversion of rail to trail, as an environmental change intervention; the second was a mass media campaign promoting walking to work, and the third was a targeted print media walking program. Providing environmental supports with minimal promotion had no effect on walking. A nation-wide mass media campaign promoting walking to work increased walking and other moderate intensity physical activity, but process evaluation indicated other promotional efforts contributed as well. The targeted print media randomised trial had the greatest effect on walking, but the increases were not greater than spontaneous change in the control. Increases in total physical activity were achieved only when the intervention was supplemented by the use of a pedometer. The expectation that broader approaches to the promotion of walking will bring about changes at the population level, were not corroborated by these case studies. There is a need for enhancement of walking-specific interventions to influence total PA at the population levels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Walking -- Health aspects.</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Public health -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Health promotion-- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology -- Methodology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of glucocorticoid and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor therapy in a mouse model of chronic asthma</field><field name="creator">Herbert, Cristan, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Using a murine model which replicates many characteristic features of human asthma, this study evaluated the effects of treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs on the lesions of chronic asthma, and investigated potential underlying molecular mechanisms. Treatment with dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, was compared with roflumilast, a novel phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor. BALB/c mice sensitised to ovalbumin were challenged with a low mass concentration of aerosolised antigen for 30 min/day, 3 days/week for 6 weeks. In weeks 5 and 6, groups of animals were treated with either dexamethasone or roflumilast. Assessment included changes in acute-on-chronic inflammation, structural remodelling of the airways and airway hyper-responsiveness to a bronchoconstrictor stimulus. These were correlated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Compared to vehicle-treated control animals, dexamethasone- and roflumilast-treated mice exhibited reduced accumulation of intra-epithelial eosinophils and chronic inflammatory cells, including CD3+ T-lymphocytes in the airways. Similarly, both drugs inhibited subepithelial fibrosis and airway epithelial thickening, although only dexamethasone inhibited goblet cell hyperplasia/metaplasia. Airway hyper-reactivity was not diminished by either drug. Both treatments suppressed production of Th2 cytokines by ovalbumin-restimulated peribronchial lymph node cells. In selectively dissected airway tissue from vehicletreated animals, increased expression of mRNA for several pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, GM-CSF, IL-6) and cytokines characteristic of Th1 (IFN-&#947;), Th2 (IL-5, IL-13)and Th17 (IL-17A) cells was demonstrated using real-time PCR. Enhanced expression of growth factors (TGF-&#946;1 and FGF-2) was also demonstrated in airway epithelium isolated by laser capture microdissection. Interestingly, whereas treatment with dexamethasone significantly inhibited expression of mRNA for all of the inflammationrelated cytokines examined, roflumilast inhibited only IL-17A, TNF-&#945;, GM-CSF and IL-6. Both drugs inhibited mRNA expression of growth factors by epithelial cells. Because roflumilast was as effective as dexamethasone in suppressing inflammation and most changes of remodelling, the selective suppression of IL-17A, TNF-&#945;, GM-CSF and IL-6 suggests that these mediators, or the cells that produce them, may have critical roles in pathogenesis. Furthermore, they may be particularly appropriate therapeutic targets in chronic asthma.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glucocorticoids -- Therapeutic use.</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Hormone therapy.</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Anti-inflammatory agents.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic skylines on uncertain data</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Bin, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Skyline analysis is important for multi-criteria decision making applications. The data in some of these applications are inherently uncertain due to various factors. Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated separately to efficient skyline computation, as well as modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct skyline analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this thesis, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p.   Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. An uncertain object is conceptually described by a probability density function (PDF) in the continuous case, or in the discrete case a set of instances (points) such that each instance has a probability to appear. We develop two efficient algorithms, the bottom-up and top-down algorithms, of computing p-skyline of a set of uncertain objects in the discrete case. We also discuss that our techniques can be applied to the continuous case as well.  The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uncertainty (Information theory)</field><field name="subject">Skyline queries.</field><field name="subject">Database management.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Computer simulations.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental investigation of refractory reactions occurring at high temperatures in continuous steel casting process</field><field name="creator">Liu, Fuhai, Material Science &amp; Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An in-depth study has been carried out to investigate refractory degradation during continuous steel casting processes. Slag/refractory interactions have been investigated through a study of the wetting behaviour and gas generation phenomena at the slag/refractory interface at 1550oC using sessile drop experiments. The influence of carbon content and slag composition was investigated. Two different steel casting slags (slag1: MnO 50%, SiO2 25%, Al2O3 25%; and slag2: MnO 40%, SiO2 60%) have been studied along with yttria stabilized zirconia refractory substrates respectively containing 10%, 15% and 20% carbon. The gas generation has been measured using the Infrared gas analyser, and its influence has also been investigated by taking optical images at varying times. The total amount of gases emitted has shown the dependence on the compositions of refractory substrates and the existence of casting slags. Under the investigation of zirconia-carbon refractory, a new phenomenon that the gas generated can push the liquid slags away and minimise the contact of slags and refractory substrates has been proven.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zirconia.</field><field name="subject">Graphite.</field><field name="subject">Aluminia.</field><field name="subject">Continuous casting.</field><field name="subject">Refractory materials.</field><field name="subject">Wettability.</field><field name="subject">Slag.</field><field name="subject">Gas generation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of SSDL</field><field name="creator">Fornasier, Patric, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The SOAP Service Description Language (SSDL) is a SOAP-centric language for describing Web Service contracts. SSDL focuses on message abstraction as the building block for creating service-oriented applications and provides an extensible range of protocol frameworks that can be used to describe and formally model Web Service interactions. SSDL's natural alignment with service-oriented design principles intuitively suggests that it encourages the creation of applications that adhere to this architectural paradigm. Given the lack of tools and empirical data for using SSDL as part of Web Services-based SOAs, we identified the need to investigate its practicability and usefulness through empirical work. To that end we have developed Soya, a programming model and runtime environment for creating and executing SSDL-based Web Services. On the one hand, Soya provides straightforward programming abstractions that foster message-oriented thinking. On the other hand, it leverages contemporary tooling (i.e. Windows Communication Foundation) with SSDL-related runtime functionality and semantics. In this thesis, we describe the design and architecture of Soya and show how it makes it possible to use SSDL as an alternative and powerful metadata language without imposing unrealistic burdens on application developers. In addition, we use Soya and SSDL in a case study which provides a set of initial empirical results with respect to SSDL's strengths and drawbacks. In summary, our work serves as a knowledge framework for better understanding message-oriented Web Service development and demonstrates SSDL's practicability in terms of implementation and usability.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Simple Object Access Protocol (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Web services.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication -- Message processing.</field><field name="subject">Internet programming.</field><field name="subject">Computer network architectures.</field><field name="subject">Electronic data processing -- Distributed processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between evidence and policy: a tracer study of promoting health equity through early childhood intervention in Australia</field><field name="creator">Bowen, Shelley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes what counts as evidence and what constitutes an evidence-informed approach to health policy development, particularly policy with an equity focus. While health policy is increasingly aiming to be ???evidence-based???, a narrow conceptualisation of this can neglect the importance of the powerful and dynamic context of public policy-making. An evidence-informed approach recognises and works with a broader range of contextual influences. The aim of this thesis was to extend and deepen understanding of how evidence informs policy that promotes health equity, through a tracer study of policy development in Australia. The objectives of the research were to examine influential types of evidence, their role and function; to investigate the context, processes and relationships that contributed to evidence informed health policy, and to gain a deeper understanding of how health equity, and evidence on equity, was conceptualised and considered in the policy process. Two Australian state government policy initiatives in the area of early childhood intervention were investigated through interviews with key policy actors in both states, and media, political and policy documentary analyses. A theory-informed framework was developed from the literature to guide this research. This thesis has led to the development of a number of theoretical models, insights and working principles to guide evidence-informed policy development. The models emerge from a conceptual framework that describes how clusters of information (contextual, expert opinion, scientific studies, policy audit, and economic) combine with a number of policy conditions (necessity, opportunity, capacity, relationships, actors and processes) to become a ???case for policy???. What follows seems to be several primary insights to the types of evidence that inform health policy; the identification of an ???adopt, adapt, apply??? phase in policy-making; and the existence of an ???equity policy gap??? ??? exposing the rare translation of equity principles into policy action. Findings from this study call for recognition of research as only one information source in policy development. The successful integration of research and policy is more likely if research evidence is seen within, and as a part of, a more complex policy development system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Policy -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of Korean conjunctive verbal suffixes: towards a theory of morphopragmatics</field><field name="creator">Chun, Chong-Hoon, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main aim of this thesis is to gain a deep understanding of the meanings of Korean conjunctive verbal suffixes from a pragmatic viewpoint, using real, not constructed data. In order to attain the purpose, this thesis conducts an in-depth analysis of the nature of the meanings, and the use, of six Korean conjunctive verbal suffixes: -ko, -nuntey, -nikka, -se, -ciman, and -to. The term the use refers to the truth-functionality of suffixes, i.e., whether they conjoin or disjoin the two propositions, which are recovered from two segments, truth-functionally. The data are obtained from 360 minutes of audio-taped Korean natural conversations. It adopts as its reasoning tool four major pragmatic theories - Gricean theory, neo-Gricean theory, Relevance Theory, and Default Semantics. However, it does not use the data to compare the four theories. The thesis emphasises how to elucidate the meanings of Korean conjunctive verbal suffixes that modern pragmatic theories cannot neatly explain. In Chapter 1 previous approaches on the six suffixes are analysed. It is pointed out that while these studies correctly equate the meanings of a given suffix with propositional relations that obtain between the two segments (linked by the suffix), they fail to see the importance of the use of the suffix. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the four pragmatic theories. The focus is on strengths and weaknesses of the four theories. In Chapter 3, we introduce propositional relations and the notions of encoding and inferred. What is meant by conjoining and disjoining truth-conditionally is also explained. Chapter 4 specifies the data. In Chapter 5, propositional relations between two propositions which are recovered from two conjoined segments are characterised. Chapter 6 applies the scope test to meanings of the six suffixes and distinguishes encoded and inferred meanings. It discusses encoded meanings of the six suffixes, which conjoin the two propositions truth-functionally, and discusses inferred meanings of only four of the six suffixes, which disjoin the two propositions truthfunctionally. In Chapter 7, we discuss the nature of the meanings of the six suffixes from two theoretical angles, Relevance Theory and Default Semantics, and in particular we argue against a unitary procedure hypothesis. Chapter 8 concludes the thesis and also includes suggestions for future studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Korean language -- Suffixes and prefixes.</field><field name="subject">Pragmatics.</field><field name="subject">Grammar, Comparative and general.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Latitudinaria latitude in thought or conduct</field><field name="creator">Landolt, Sandra, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Latitudinaria* explores and critiques the ambivalence between current technological progress and the consequently depersonalised social structures and systems. I am using the development from mechanical Automata to mass production juxtaposed to Charlie Chaplin??s film and Jean Tinguelys kinetic art, as examples for the change of the social condition from the industrialisation to the current post-industrial era.  The change of social condition I refer to as the ??depersonalisation?? or ??dehumanisation?? effect supported by my working experiences in the health system. The ??medicalisation of the life span?? and the discrepancy of creating a sustainable future less profit orientated are two indicators of how far we have been removed from our bodies. These observations are supported by the writing of Ivan Illich??s Medical Nemesis and Frank Schirrmachers?? analysis of the change of the social structure using the family configuration as an example. These conceptual ideas are visualised by a selection of kinetic art works and video installations. In the heart of this body of work is the process-orientated documentation of Zero AGL project. The project documents the journey of a discarded airplane that was re-assembled and reanimated by myself and a group of volunteers supported by local businesses. The struggle of the group of people stands as a metaphor for the current dilemma of the restricted usage of public space. Further it reflects on my own limitations dealing with the Australian outback culture and the transition of my own sculptural practice from small scale art works into the arena of life size public Art. Those experiences shaped the process and the direction of the project. The motivation for the creation of the body of kinetic sculptures and video installation is to highlight the absurdity of social constructed categories and controlling systems in a post-industrial society. The subject matter focuses on the social construction of the categories of the ??Norm?? and the limitations of failure. Latitudinaria gives the audience a lateral view on how human betterment is not always essentially connected to technological progress but on transforming ideas and enhancing it from a different point of view. * freedom from normal restraints, limitations and regulations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art and society</field><field name="subject">Depersonalization</field><field name="subject">Kinetic sculpture</field><field name="subject">Video art</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art)</field><field name="subject">Tinguely, Jean -- 1925-</field><field name="subject">Illich, Ivan, 1926- -- Medical nemesis</field><field name="subject">Schirrmachers, Frank</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of specific genetic host factors, specific dietary factors and Helicobacter pylori infection on the risk of gastric cancer</field><field name="creator">Ha, Mai Dung, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Gastric cancer (GC) is ranked as the second most common fatal malignancy worldwide.

Methods: Functional dyspepsia (FD) controls from three ethnic groups in Malaysia, Chinese (123), Indian (110) and Malay (84) and Singaporean Chinese (127) plus Malaysian Chinese gastric cancer cases (55)were examined. Polymorphisms in IL-1B-511, IL-1RN, IL-10 cluster, TNFA-308 and TLR5+1174 were determined by PCR-RFLP or PCR; H. pylori status by serology, dietary intake by questionnaire and gastric IL-1b levels by real time PCR.  Results: 1) Significant differences existed in the frequency of all polymorphisms, except IL-1B-1473 and TNFA-308, in the three Malaysian ethnic groups and in the IL-1B-511 polymorphism in Malaysian and Singaporean Chinese FD 2) Globally, two distinct patterns of IL-1B-511, IL-1RN, IL-10-1082, IL-10-592 and TNFA-308 exist, Western and East-Asian 3) In Malaysian Malays, the IL-10 ATA haplotype was associated with H. pylori susceptibility 4) In Malaysian Chinese an increased risk of GC was associated with carriage of the IL-1B-1473 G allele {OR=4.4(1.3-15.3)} and the IL-1B-511 C allele {OR=1.8(0.8-4.1)} 5) Increased levels of IL-1b were observed in Singaporean and Malaysian Chinese FD subjects carrying the IL-1-511C and IL-1-1473G alleles 6) Malaysian Chinese not consuming fresh fruit and vegetables had the highest risk of GC {OR=10.2 (3.4-30.6)} 7) The highest risk of GC {OR=37.3(3.3-424.8)} was observed in H. pylori positive Malaysian Chinese who carried both the IL-1B-511C and IL-1B-1473G alleles and did not consume fresh fruit and vegetables.  Conclusions: In Malaysian Chinese, H. pylori infection, host genetic and dietary factors all contribute to the risk of GC. However the significant difference observed in the frequency of host genetic polymorphisms within and between ethnic groups suggests that a single group of risk factors cannot be used to determine GC risk across all populations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system -- Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori infections.</field><field name="subject">Nutritionally induced diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heroics of the false: a new look at noir.</field><field name="creator">Breukelaar, Jennifer S, English, Media &amp; Performance, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate the nature of noir subjectivity, and the degree to which it can be described as heroic. To investigate these issues, I have chosen to illustrate my argument by analysing my novel, Viper, and two films that renew the noir cycle at different socio-political crossroads in America: in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock???s late noir, Vertigo, and in 1974, Frances Ford Coppola???s neo-noir, The Conversation. Because these texts present an extreme theorisation of deception in terms of the assembling and erasure of subjective identity, they will serve as a basis to explore the question of noir subjectivity. In proceeding thus, I argue in the dissertation that film noir???s most innovative borrowing can be described as a monstrous stitching together of incompatible parts???the real and the imaginary, the past and the present, the living and the dead???which accounts for a cut both between, and within, the image. It is this prosthetic approach to representation that takes the noir mode beyond its existential, individualist limits, and accounts for the subjective wound in noir: the heroic conflict between the singular and the multiple. In my analytic procedure then, I extend the idea of monstrosity beyond its current boundaries in contemporary theory. I do this by fusing Marie H??l??ne Huet???s conception of the monstrous imagination, which is a theory of art, with Gilles Deleuze???s powers of the false, which belongs to a philosophy of time. I posit a dialogic exchange across these analyses and my novel to suggest that the cinematic cut not only accounts for what Deleuze has termed the time-image but also is symptomatic of the chronic wounding of the riven noir hero. These analyses suggest that, while sustaining the aura of authorship through technical innovation and stylistic mastery, film noir serves paradoxically to challenge the mastery of the model designated as masculine. In my novel I continue to deal with the issues raised in the dissertation, through a rearticulation of a subjectivity that irrevocably alters its relation to representation in its affinity with the image, its serial movement through interstitial space, and its novel powers of falsification.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hitchcock, Alfred, 1899-1980.</field><field name="subject">Coppola, Francis Ford, 1939- -- Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Representation (Philosophy)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long term housing prices in Australia and some economic perspectives</field><field name="creator">Stapledon, Nigel David, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis constructs, principally from primary sources, a long term time series for house and land prices for Sydney and Melbourne, and house price and rental yield series for Australia. These new series span the period 1880-1965 and give an historical perspective beyond the period from 1970 for which existing house price time series begin for Australia and for most of the world. The price series indicates that the modern experience (i.e. since the 1970s) of a significant upward trend in real prices differs markedly from the experience in the first half of the 20th century when house prices moved very little. The thesis then takes several approaches to explaining the apparent shift in direction in the mid 20th century. The first approach examines house prices in terms of demand and supply variables. Urban theory says that demographic and income factors are critical. However, assessed over this long time span, these demand factors do not offer a satisfactory explanation. Additionally, it is found that there is no cointegrating relationship between prices and income. Rather, it appears that supply factors have probably been the pivotal influence in explaining the shift in direction, consistent with a growing literature which focuses on the role of regulation and other constraints on supply. In Australia???s case, government policies imposing capital contributions on the cost of land appear to be a major factor. The second approach taken is to view housing in terms of asset pricing as more typically applied to the equity market by Campbell and Shiller (1988) and others. A central debate is whether or not there has been a structural fall in the equity yield and given the parallel fall in the house yield, this question is posed for housing. The thesis finds that tax and other factors can explain a structural decline in the housing yield. The house rental yield appears to be a better predictor of future rental growth and a negative predictor of future returns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of urinary incontinence amongst Chinese women in Sydney</field><field name="creator">Hubbard, Mandy Queeneth, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction While urinary incontinence is a condition that affects men and women of all ages, it is more prevalent amongst post-menopausal women. Chinese women have been under-represented at the uro-gynaecology clinic at the Royal Hospital for Women for reasons yet unknown. Objectives What are the reasons for this under-representation? Do the Chinese women in Sydney not know of the services available for urinary incontinence, or, do they not want to seek help? What are their beliefs on urinary incontinence, and how do these beliefs affect their health seeking behaviour, if at all? Methodology Informal interviews with continence specialists and other healthcare professionals determined the selection of Qualitative research methodology, using Grounded Theory and Ethnography. Focus group discussion and interviews were the data collection techniques used for this research. Chinese women that had been in Australia for less than 5 years, more than 5 years and those born in Australia were recruited to participate. Results &amp; Conclusions The knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of Chinese women in Sydney differ depending on whether or not they were born in Australia, and the length of time in Australia. With Australian born Chinese being more acculturated, having greater knowledge of the services available for urinary incontinence and more likely to seek help for urinary incontinence compared to overseas born Chinese women. While those women who had been in Australia for more than 5 years were more informed about the available services, they did not necessarily use the available services.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urinary incontinence -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flute acoustics: measurement, modelling and design</field><field name="creator">Dickens, Paul, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A well-made flute is always a compromise and the job of flute makers is to achieve a musically and aesthetically satisfying compromise; a task that involves much trial and-error. The practical aim of this thesis is to develop a mathematical model of the flute and a computer program that assists in the flute design process. Many musical qualities of a woodwind instrument may be calculated from the acoustic impedance spectrum of the instrument. A technique for fast and accurate measurement of this quantity is developed. The technique is based on the multiple-microphone technique, and uses resonance-free impedance loads to calibrate the system and spectral shaping to improve the precision at impedance extrema. The impedance spectra of the flute and clarinet are measured over a wide range of fingerings, yielding a comprehensive and accurate database. The impedance properties of single finger holes are measured using a related technique, and fitformulae are derived for the length corrections of closed finger holes for a typical range of hole sizes and lengths. The bore surface of wooden instruments can change over time with playing and this can affect the acoustic impedance, and therefore the playing quality. Such changes in acoustic impedance are explored using wooden test pipes. To account for the effect of a typical player on flute tuning, an empirical correction is determined from the measured tuning of both modern and classical flutes as played by several professional and semi-professional players. By combining the measured impedance database with the player effects and various results in the literature a mathematical model of the input impedance of flutes is developed and implemented in command-line programs written in the software language C. A user-friendly graphical interface is created using the flute impedance model for the purposes of flute acoustical design and analysis. The program calculates the tuning and other acoustical properties for any given geometry. The program is applied to a modern flute and a classical flute. The capabilities and limitations of the software are thereby illustrated and possible contributions of the program to contemporary flute design are explored.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acoustical engineering.</field><field name="subject">Music -- Acoustics and physics.</field><field name="subject">Flute -- Construction.</field><field name="subject">Woodwind instruments -- Acoustics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Software radio global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver front-end design: sampling and jitter considerations</field><field name="creator">Amin, Bilal, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the sampling and jitter specifications and considerations for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) software receivers. Software Radio (SWR) technologies are being used in the implementation of communication receivers in general and GNSS receivers in particular. With the advent of new GPS signals, and a range of new Galileo and GLONASS signals soon becoming available, GNSS is an application where SWR and software-defined radio (SDR) are likely to have an impact. The sampling process is critical for SWR receivers where it occurs as close to the antenna as possible. One way to achieve this is by BandPass Sampling (BPS), which is an undersampling technique that exploits aliasing to perform downconversion. In this thesis, the allowable sampling frequencies are calculated and analyzed for the multiple frequency BPS software radio GNSS receivers. The SNR degradation due to jitter is calculated and the required jitter standard deviation allowable for wach GNSS band of interest is evaluated and a basic jitter budget is calculated that could assist in the design of multiple frequency SWR GNSS receivers. Analysis shows that psec-level jitter specifications are required in order to keep jitter noise well below the thermal noise for software radio satellite navigation receivers. However, analysis of a BPSK system shows that large errors occur if the jittered sample crosses a data bit boundary. However, the signal processing techniques required to process the BOC modulation are much more challenging than those for traditional BPSK. BOC and AltBOC have more transitions per chip of spreading code and hence jitter creates greater SNR degradation. This work derives expressions for noise due to jitter taking into account the transition probability in QPSK, BOC, AltBOC systems. Both simulations and analysis are used to give a better understanding of jitter effects on Software Radio GNSS receivers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System.</field><field name="subject">Software radio.</field><field name="subject">Digital communications.</field><field name="subject">Sampling -- Software.</field><field name="subject">Digital electronics -- Testing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transplantation of fetal pig islet-like cell clusters as therapy for diabetes</field><field name="creator">Dean, Sophia Katrina, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fetal pig islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) were transplanted into the thymus or omentum of STZ-induced diabetic pigs immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CsA) and deoxyspergualin (DSG), as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes. C-peptide levels in response to glucagon and arginine significantly increased over time using 1 litter of ICCs with highest levels obtained at 100 days post-transplantation. Increasing the number of ICCs to 2 litters was not advantageous. Histology of the graft showed all 4 pancreatic endocrine cells. Normoglycaemia was achieved for transient periods without insulin administration in 4 out of 12 pigs. These results suggest sub-optimal insulin production, possibly due to the adverse effects of CsA on the grafted &#946; cells. The effect of CsA on adult porcine &#946; cells was investigated and adverse effects were shown. Renal toxicity and adverse changes to the haematological parameters did not occur despite high CsA levels although minimal toxicity to the liver was observed. The results indicate that the use of CsA monotherapy in the maintenance phase to prevent rejection of allografted pancreatic &#946; cells may become a subsequent problem over time. As an alternative to chronic immunossuppression, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was administered for 10 days in pigs. Using anti-CD3 alone, only 1 out 4 pigs showed cells positive for insulin. The addition of a 5-day CsA course administered the day before transplantation did not promote allograft survival. The use of DSG for 10 days with anti-CD3 promoted graft survival with the histology showing the 4 endocrine cells 3 weeks post-transplantation. An attempt was made to replace any form of immunossuppression by encapsulating fetal pig ICCs in barium alginate, which were able to remain viable when transplanted in NOD/SCID mice. Fibrosis was detected in BALB/c mice transplanted with encapsulated fetal ICCs suggesting that fetal pig ICCs shed antigens that elicit an immune response. Results from this study show that although fetal pig ICCs may be a viable source of insulin-producing cells, the use of CsA to prevent rejection has adverse effects on graft function. Encapsulation as well as transient immunosuppression is worthy of further investigation to prevent rejection of fetal pig ICCs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Insulin.</field><field name="subject">Islands of Langerhans -- Transplantation.</field><field name="subject">Swine -- Fetuses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stability of thin-walled metal tubes with elastic uni-lateral internal restraint.</field><field name="creator">Roufegarinejad, Ali, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical study into the behaviour of thin-walled metal tubes that are filled with elastic material. The study has considered the behaviour and design of concrete-filled steel columns by analysing the effect of the combined actions of axial compression and bending on closed stainless steel cross-sections with a concrete infill as well as the elastic buckling of square, circular and elliptical thin-walled steel tubes, when filled with elastic material. The elastic local buckling of a rectangular plate having four edges clamped and subjected to in-plane linearly varying uniaxial loading with and without juxtaposition with a rigid infill has also been studied. Concrete-filled composite columns find widespread use globally in engineering structures because of their optimal strength and ease of construction. Enhancing the strength of filled columns by utilising newer materials such as stainless steel or shape memory alloys for the skin of the cross-section of the column will increase the construction cost of the column. In order to circumvent this increased construction cost, or to minimise it, the metal skin should be as thin as possible. Members with thin-walled cross-section are prone to lateral torsional buckling, and in particular they are prone to local buckling, with the latter buckling mode playing an important role in the strength of a composite column with a concrete infill. The local buckling coefficient is enhanced by the provision of a rigid concrete infill, and efficient design must make use of this fact to minimise the cost of the skin. The initial portions of this thesis demonstrate the beneficial effects that the rigid concrete core has on the overall strength, and also on the local buckling behaviour of thin-walled metal tubes. The local buckling of the metal skin has been modelled in this thesis by using a Ritz-based energy method. In bi-lateral and uni-lateral buckling studies of rectangular plates, a more general trigonometric function has been selected by application of boundary conditions to the chosen shape function, with these boundary conditions being implemented to make the chosen shape function satisfy the edge conditions for the problem under consideration. The restraining medium is modelled as a tensionless foundation and this restraint condition is introduced through a penalty method formulation. Extensive comparative, convergence, and parametric studies have been carried out by considering a wide range of uni-laterally constrained plates. Following a concise review of the available literature, techniques for analysing the elastic local buckling of thin-walled square tubes, fully filled with elastic materials and subjected to concentric uni-axial compression, are formulated by means of a simple stiffness approach and a proper Ritz-based technique. This method is then extended to account for the local buckling of thin-walled circular and elliptical cylinders with elastic infill. By representation of a proper trigonometric displacement function in the formulation which is capable of incorporating the effects of the penetration zone in a harmonic form, in addition to satisfying all the necessary boundary conditions, it is shown that the buckling solution reduces to a dimensionless representation for which the relevant geometrical and material properties that govern the local buckling coefficient can be identified. It was found that the provision of lightweight and low density infill is functional and attractive with respect to an increase in the efficacy of the restraint. A comparison was made, and good agreement was found to exist, between the results obtained from this study and results that are available in the literature. Finally, a strength to weight index is introduced that quantifies the enhancement in the local buckling coefficient for a number of materials with a wide range of stiffness and density. This index has potential applications for optimal design in aerospace and other specialized engineering applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin-walled structures.</field><field name="subject">Buckling (Mechanics) -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship between students??? approaches to learning and the development of clinical reasoning ability</field><field name="creator">Tetik, Cihat, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between learning approaches and the development of clinical reasoning ability. The main questions for the study were: Is there a statistically significant relationship between students??? learning approaches and development of clinical reasoning ability? If there is a relationship between approaches to learning and development of clinical reasoning ability, which students develop this ability faster? And How does learning approach change relate to the development of reasoning ability? The Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F) was used in order to evaluate participants??? learning approaches and Diagnostic Thinking Inventory (DTI) to measure participants??? diagnostic thinking ability. In order to determine changes of learning approaches, the same students were invited to fill out the same questionnaires one year later. This quantitative study was followed by a qualitative inquiry including in-depth interviews aimed at exploring the association of a change in learning approach score with the development of clinical reasoning ability. These interviews also explored the factors influencing learning approaches of these students. Those students with the greatest change in R-SPQ-2F scores between the two surveys were selected for interview. Analysis of the findings of both the quantitative and qualitative phases of this research leads the researcher to conclude that; - there is a correlation between ongoing learning approaches and the development of clinical reasoning ability; this correlation is positive if the approach is deep and it is negative if the approach is surface, - progress towards either end of the learning approach continuum is associated with observation of experts, reasoning practice and/or feedback from experts, and - progress towards either end of the learning approach continuum seems an earlier and better indicator of developing reasoning ability than categorization of learning approach because both learning approach change and the factor causing this change were associated with the development of clinical reasoning ability. This study contributes to understanding of the importance of ongoing learning approaches and the development of clinical reasoning ability by encouraging deep learning approach characteristics. Factors affecting learning approaches are also associated with the development of clinical reasoning ability. Their effect is more than expected.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behaviour and design of thin walled concrete filled steel box columns</field><field name="creator">Mursi, Mohanad, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the behaviour of hollow and concrete filled steel columns fabricated from thin steel plates. The columns are investigated under axial, uniaxial and biaxial loading. The currently available international standards for composite structures are limited to the design of concrete filled steel columns with compact sections and yield stress of steel up to 460 N/mm2. This thesis consists of both experimental and analytical studies and design recommendations for future use. Three comprehensive series of experimental tests are conducted on hollow and concrete filled steel columns. The principal parameters that have been considered in the test programmes are the slenderness of the component plates, the yield stress of the steel and the loading conditions. In the first test series, three slender hollow steel columns and three slender composite columns are tested under uniaxial loading. The steel utilised is mild steel. High strength steel is utilised in the second test programme. In this test series four stub columns, eight short columns and eight slender columns are tested, each set consists of four hollow and four composite columns. Short columns are tested under axial loading to investigate the confinement effect provided by the steel casing. Slender columns are tested under uniaxial loading to investigate the coupled instability of local and global buckling. The third test programme is quite novel and considers the behaviour of hollow and concrete filled steel columns fabricated with high strength structural steel plate and subjected to biaxial bending. In this test eight short columns and ten slender columns each of them consisting of hollow and composite columns are investigated under biaxial loading.  Analytical models are developed herein to elucidate the behaviour of the hollow and composite columns considering cross section slenderness, yield stress and loading conditions. An iterative model considering the coupled global and local buckling in the elastic and plastic range incorporating material nonlinearities is developed to investigate the behaviour of slender columns fabricated from mild steel. An improved deformation control model is developed to investigate the behaviour of slender high strength steel columns considering the confinement effect and local and post-local buckling in the elastic and plastic range. Then a numerical model for biaxial bending is developed to study the behaviour of short and slender concrete filled high strength steel columns under biaxial loading incorporating interaction buckling considering material and geometric nonlinearities. The scope of the thesis presents a wide range of experimental and theoretical studies of an extremely novel nature. It demonstrates the benefit of confinement and the consideration of local and post-local buckling in the elastic and plastic range. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the area of composite steel-concrete structural applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural analysis (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Composite construction.</field><field name="subject">Columns, Iron and steel.</field><field name="subject">Columns, Concrete -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Strains and stresses -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Teflon degree: a Batesonian-cybernetic study of love in learning.</field><field name="creator">Hungerford, Guy, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Because the first year of university education is for students a concentrated point of turbulence (in the form of failing, dropping out, changing courses or degrees, making changes in future plans and present priorities, and suffering anxieties about the same), it has been the focus of much study by education specialists, along the lines of  "What are we doing wrong?" and "How can we do better?"  "The teflon degree" is a metaphor derived from the image of a mess-preventing armour plating. The assumption that turbulence in the first year is naturally a bad thing fits by extension with an idea that turbulence, mess, and so on are to be avoided. Better than avoidance would be the construction of a system which would make it impossible for such things to happen. "The teflon degree" is a fantasy of a program of study that one can embark on, knowing what one will do and how one will do it, and then slide through, essentially unchanged, "augmented" by the acquisition of skills and qualifications.  This thesis is a critique of the conceptual underpinnings of such an ideal. It is also an evocation of the qualities in university education which are obscured or harmed by the pursuit of such an ideal, foremost among them being love. I argue that love is not a sentimental afterthought, but an essential component of all genuine learning. This critique is carried out through the conceptual framework established by the work of Gregory Bateson in cybernetics.  The empirical component of the thesis is drawn from interviews with individual students; these are intended both to illustrate and to make concrete the theoretical concerns which are its primary focus. With Bateson, both an anthropologist and a philosopher, as my central theorist, I have drawn on both anthropological and philosophical texts in the development of my argument, including Buber, Durkheim, Gaita, Hegel, Murdoch, Sartre, Serres, Simmel, and Weber.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher education.</field><field name="subject">Pedagogy.</field><field name="subject">Cybernetics.</field><field name="subject">Learning -- Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Educational sociology.</field><field name="subject">Affective education.</field><field name="subject">Learning, Psychology of.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theories of photography in the visual arts classroom</field><field name="creator">Jones, Susanne Rae, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the findings from a series of experimental investigations that explore young people's transition from socially constrained image making to innovative photographic practice within the art education context. It identifies the constraints young peoples' vernacular theories about what makes a good photograph, have on their own photographic origination. It draws on the work of Berti and Freeman (1997) and Karmiloff-Smith (1992) and accepts underlying descriptions of theory of mind development in young children (Wellman 1990). The data was collected from 117 adolescents (72 girls and 45 boys) aged between 10 and 17 years old, who were attending government primary and secondary schools in Sydney Australia between late 2001 and mid 2003. The schools were located in and around Sydney's eastern, western and south-western suburbs and ranged from the inner city to the semi-rural hinterland. The students represent a range of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds.  Participants' theories about photography and what makes 'good' and 'bad' photographs was ascertained by asking a series of structured questions at interview and analysing written responses to a questionnaire Five experimental situations produced 1344 photographs which were coded and analysed using ANOVA to establish between age-group and experimental task differences. The photographs were judged by expert photographers, for levels of innovation. Adolescents' explanations about the photographs they made were analysed for reflexive thinking. In order to map any shift in representational development throughout adolescence the data were divided into three age groups. 10-13 year old (n=40), 14-16 year olds (n=69) and 17 year olds(n=11). The study produced evidence that adolescents aged 10-13 years old had a na??ve theory of photography, and that 14-16 year olds had an emerging reflexive theory of photography, but they were constrained by both procedural understandings and social conventions of photography. Expert 17 year olds and adults have a reflexive theory of photography as evidenced by higher percentage of innovative images and more reflexive statements about their photographs. The findings provide baseline understandings of the cognitive processes implicit in photograph origination by adolescents and suggests implications for further research into the teaching and learning of photography as a creative medium in the Secondary School Visual Arts classroom.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art and photography.</field><field name="subject">Photography, Artistic -- Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'To see a world in a grain of sand...': thinking universality and specificity for a feminist politics of difference</field><field name="creator">Hinton, Peta, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sexual difference has emerged in the last three decades as an enduring question for feminism.  Drawing attention to the embodied nature of subjectivity, it enables feminists to counter the more insidious presumptions of universality and the phallocentric economy of knowledge production, and makes possible feminine expressions of subjectivity.  At the same time, engaging the nature of difference has opened the way to a more detailed interrogation of identity, specifically the identity of ' woman' and 'the feminine' as categories of feminist analysis.  However, tensions have emerged within this field over the concept of community, and how to motivate for political change on the basis of a common identity when the identity of woman is itself contested.   In tracing these arguments, this thesis raises a number of considerations about the way difference is understood.  It finds that a conceptual commitment to the specificity of the body as properly constitutive of the political can run the risk of sidelining, denigrating and presuming to excise what appears as universal, masculine, or phallocentric.  In doing so, it potentially leaves aside a full political engagement with the generative and implicated nature of these terms in the formation of all identity.  Consequently, questions around thought, universality, virtuality, and disembodiment may not be given full consideration, with the outcome that feminism may be foreclosing its political domain from important formative concerns.  The primary aim of this thesis is to open these categories of analysis to question, to understand how they have been constructed in debates around difference, and to bring to light some of the assumptions which remain axiological to what properly constitutes feminist politics.  Engaging Luce Irigaray's reading of divinity for community and identity, this thesis argues that if the implicated nature of identity is taken seriously then the organising categories fundamental to notions of political action and community become a general field of difference which exceeds the reach of feminist politics as it currently stands.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sex differences -- Political aspects.</field><field name="subject">Feminism -- Political aspects.</field><field name="subject">Feminist theory.</field><field name="subject">Corporeality.</field><field name="subject">Politics of location.</field><field name="subject">Cyberfeminism.</field><field name="subject">Disembodiment.</field><field name="subject">Virtuality.</field><field name="subject">Mind.</field><field name="subject">Thought.</field><field name="subject">Dualism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing overland mobility of Cryptosporidium Oocysts</field><field name="creator">Kaucner, Christine E., Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The mechanisms responsible for overland transport of faecal pathogens, particularly Cryptosporidium oocysts, from animal sources to water bodies are not fully understood. Surface properties of microbes, such as electrostatic charge and hydrophobicity, are thought to contribute to their aggregation and attachment to solid surfaces. There is conflicting evidence that methods used to purify Cryptosporidium oocysts from faecal material may affect the oocyst surface, leading to biased conclusions from transport studies. By studying oocyst surface properties, aggregation and soil attachment, this thesis addressed whether oocyst purification methods influence overland transport studies, and whether oocysts are likely to be associated with particles during transport.  When using the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon (MATH) assay with octane, oocyst hydrophobicity was shown to be method and isolate dependent, with oocysts displaying moderate to high hydrophobicity in 0.01 M KNO3. There was no observed attachment, however, to the hydrophobic octyl-SepharoseTM bead ligands when using the same suspension solution. Oocyst age did not appear to influence their hydrophobicity. A small but statistically significant proportion of oocysts displayed a net negative surface charge as observed by their attachment to an anion exchange ligand (DEAE). There was no difference in hydrophobicity or surface charge observed between purified oocysts and oocysts that had been extracted without the use of harsh chemicals and solutions with dehydrating properties.  Purified oocysts did not aggregate at pH values between 3.3 and 9.0, nor in solutions lower than 0.59 M in ionic strength at a pH 2.7 which is approaching the reported isoelectric point of oocysts. This finding suggests that oocysts may not form aggregates under general environmental conditions. The association of purified oocysts with soil particles was observed in settling columns. Attachment to soil particles was not conclusive since the settling of the soil particles may have entrained single oocysts. Nonetheless, approximately 27% of oocysts were estimated to be unbound to soil or associated with small soil particles. Hence models for oocyst overland transport should consider a significant fraction as single entities or associated with soil particles less than about 3 &#956;m in size.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crytosporidium.</field><field name="subject">Crytosporidium -- Eggs -- Dispersal -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Groundwater flow -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity and Life Course: A Long-term Perspective on the Lives of Australian-born Chinese</field><field name="creator">Ngan, Lucille, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the construction of ?Chineseness? by Australian-born Chinese through their interactions with mainstream ?white? society and Chinese diasporic communities in Australia. It represents an interdisciplinary study based on qualitative research and critical analysis of forty-three in-depth interviews with Australian-born Chinese whose families have resided in Australia for three generations or more. Diasporic narratives, fraught with contentions over belonging and difference, often lead to ambiguous ramifications of identity formation. While the notion of hybridity problematises the unsettling boundaries of identities, there is still a continuing perception that ethnic identification decreases over successive generations, resulting in assimilation. However, contrary to this assumption, this study shows that subsequent generations also encounter complicated experiences involving both feelings of cultural ambivalence and enrichment. While the rewriting of identity takes place against the varying circumstances of resettlement, the experiences and transitions across the respondents? life course concurrently inscribes Chineseness onto their lives in diverse ways. Furthermore, Chineseness is continually (re)constructed through decentered connections with an imaginary homeland. Consequently, despite generational longevity, strong affinities with Australian society and longstanding national identities grounded in Australian culture, Chineseness is still a significant part of their identity, whether they willingly choose to associate with it or not. The focus on revaluating the concept of Chineseness and elucidating the sense of identity of sequential generations has important ramifications for the development of a more informed theoretical model for understanding the long-term effects of migration, especially on the process of identity formation and feelings of home and belonging.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese Australians -- Ethnic identity.</field><field name="subject">Chinese Australians -- Interviews.</field><field name="subject">Chinese Australians -- Cultural assimilation.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia -- Social life and customs.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovative heat exchangers for solar water heaters</field><field name="creator">Soo Too, Yen Chean, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The performance of two innovative collector-loop heat exchangers used in pumped circulation solar water heaters was investigated experimentally and numerically, and TRNSYS simulation models were developed for evaluating long-term performance.  The heat exchangers evaluated are a narrow gap mantle on a vertical tank and a falling film system in a standard gas hot water tank. The falling film system is based on minor changes to a mass produced tank and does not require the addition of a special purpose heat exchanger.  The heat exchangers were assessed for a range of operating conditions to quantify the overall heat exchanger UAhx value and the effect of thermal stratification in the tank. Flow visualisation experiments and CFD modelling were also performed to provide detailed understanding of the operation characteristics of the heat exchangers.  For each heat exchanger, the measured and computed collector loop side heat transfer coefficients were correlated by developing new Nusselt number versus Reynolds and Prandtl number functions. New heat transfer correlations were developed for both types of heat exchanger and have been implemented into full solar water heater simulation models in TRNSYS. Predictions of tank stratification conditions in each heat exchanger were in good agreement with experimental data. Compared to a standard direct circulation system, the annual performance of the mantle system and falling film system are 8% and 18% less respectively. The decrease in system performance is due to the heat exchanger penalty and reduced thermal stratification in the storage tank, however they have the added features of freeze protection and suitability for hard water areas. They are also cheaper to manufacture than convectional heat exchange systems. The annual performance of a falling film solar water heater was shown to be affected by de-stratification if an in-tank electric booster was used. However, improved performance can be achieved if an advanced switching controller is used to modulate the flow rate such that the collector return temperature is always higher than the temperature in the top of the tank.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat exchangers.</field><field name="subject">Solar water heaters.</field><field name="subject">Simulation methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organised individualisation: ambiguities in the contemporary transformation of network capitalism.</field><field name="creator">Ebert, Norbert Felix, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Individualisation has become an ambiguous feature of late modern societies. It carries a sense of liberation, yet individuals are compelled to cope with a fragmented and pluralised social order largely by themselves. While the advance of individual freedoms is taken-for-granted, the seemingly unnoticed structural imposition to individually negotiate the boundaries between systemic and normative processes is portrayed as individual freedom and social integration. This thesis explores the ambiguities underpinning individualisation as they emerge from contemporary transformations of capitalism and work.  As a result of a hyper-differentiated late modern social order the interface between functional and normative processes shifts from an institutional and organisational level to an individual one. Individualisation can no longer sufficiently be described as 'institutionalised individualism', either in respect to the realisation of a rather consistent normative infrastructure, or as mere individual responses to systemic dependencies. I argue that under the contemporary conditions of marketisation individuals increasingly become the focal point for the negotiation of systemic and normative processes. Substantiated by the theoretical argument of 'corporatisation' and the analysis of interviews with managers from international corporations, I contend that various workorganisational developments transform the subtle pressures to individually negotiate the demarcations between systems and lifeworld into an organising principle. I describe the emerging ambiguities with which individuals struggle, in particular at the workplace, as 'organised individualisation'. Individuals become 'active hubs' not only for the coordination but also for the reproduction of their own systemic dependencies which are organisationally pre-defined.  While the responsibility to pseudo-negotiate systemic processes is put on individuals, the lack of opportunities to publicly debate and contest society's normative underpinnings generates deficiencies in social integration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Individualism.</field><field name="subject">Social values.</field><field name="subject">Social integration.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using web texts for word sense disambiguation</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yuanyong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In all natural languages, ambiguity is a universal phenomenon. When a word has multiple meaning depending on its contexts it is called an ambiguous word. The process of determining the correct meaning of a word (formally named word sense) in a given context is word sense disambiguation(WSD). WSD is one of the most fundamental problems in natural language processing. If properly addressed, it could lead to revolutionary advancement in many other technologies such as text search engine technology, automatic text summarization and classification, automatic lexicon construction, machine translation and automatic learning agent technology. One difficulty that has always confronted WSD researchers is the lack of high quality sense specific information. For example, if the word "power" Immediately preceds the word "plant", it would strongly constrain the meaning of "plant" to be "an industrial facility". If "power" is replaced by the phrase "root of a", then the sense of "plant" is dictated to be "an organism" of the kingdom Planate. It is obvious that manually building a comprehensive sense specific information base for each sense of each word is impractical. Researchers also tried to extract such information from large dictionaries as well as manually sense tagged corpora. Most of the dictionaries used for WSD are not built for this purpose and have a lot of inherited peculiarities. While manual tagging is slow and costly, automatic tagging is not successful in providing a reliable performance. Furthermore, it is often the case that for a randomly chosen word (to be disambiguated), the sense specific context corpora that can be collected from dictionaries are not large enough. Therefore, manually building sense specific information bases or extraction of such information from dictionaries are not effective approaches to obtain sense specific information. A web text, due to its vast quantity and wide diversity, becomes an ideal source for extraction of large quantity of sense specific information. In this thesis, the impacts of Web texts on various aspects of WSD has been investigated. New measures and models are proposed to tame enormous amount of Web texts for the purpose of WSD. They are formally evaluated by experimenting their disambiguation performance on about 70 ambiguous nouns. The results are very encouraging and have helped revealing the great potential of using Web texts for WSD. The results are published in three papers at Australia national and international level (Wang&amp;Hoffmann,2004,2005,2006)[42][43][44].</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Search engine.</field><field name="subject">Word sense disambiguation.</field><field name="subject">Ambiguity.</field><field name="subject">Semantics -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Computational linguistics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of fracture in unreinforced masonry</field><field name="creator">Chaimoon, Krit, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis are to study the fracture behaviour in unreinforced masonry, to carry out a limited experimental program on three-point bending (TPB) masonry panels and to develop a time-dependent fracture formulation for the study of mode I fracture in quasi-brittle materials. 	A micro-model for fracture in unreinforced masonry is developed using the concept of the discrete crack approach. All basic masonry failure modes are taken into account. To capture brick diagonal tensile cracking and masonry crushing, a linear compression cap is proposed with a criterion for defining the compression cap. The failure surface for brick and brick-mortar interfaces are modelled using a Mohr-Coulomb failure surface with a tension cut-off and a linear compression cap. The fracture formulation, in nonholonomic rate form within a quasi-prescribed displacement approach, is based on a piecewise-linear constitutive law and is in the form of a so-called ?linear complementarity problem? (LCP). The proposed model has been applied to simulating fracture in masonry shear walls and masonry TPB panels. 	An experimental program was undertaken to investigate the failure behaviour of masonry panels under TPB with relatively low strength mortar. The basic material parameters were obtained from compression, TPB and shear tests on bricks, mortar and brick-mortar interfaces. The experimental results showed that the failure of masonry TPB panels is governed by both tensile and shear failure rather than just tensile failure. The simulation of the masonry TPB tests compared well with the experimental results. 	In addition, the LCP fracture formulation is enhanced to study the time-dependent mode I fracture in quasi-brittle materials. Two main time-dependent sources, the viscoelasticity of the bulk material and the crack rate dependent opening, are taken into account. A simplified crack rate model is proposed to include the rate-dependent crack opening. The model is applied to predicting time-dependent crack growth in plain concrete beams under sustained loading. The model captures the essential features including the observed strength increase with loading rate, the load-deflection and load-CMOD responses, the deflection-time and CMOD-time curves, the predicted time to failure and the stress distributions in the fracture zone.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Masonry.</field><field name="subject">Masonry -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Interface model.</field><field name="subject">Linear complementarity problem.</field><field name="subject">Compression cap.</field><field name="subject">Creep.</field><field name="subject">Crack rate dependency.</field><field name="subject">Finite element.</field><field name="subject">Fracture.</field><field name="subject">Softening.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capacity-development at work: the contribution of workplace-based learning to tax administration</field><field name="creator">McManus, Jacqueline, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with workers, workplace learning and organisations. In the current climate of techno-logisation and globalisation, change is constant. Consequently, development of workers??? capacity to grow and adapt is essential for both the employability of the individual, and the economic survival of organisations. Capacity is considered essential because it encompasses more than current ability, it enables the growth of innovative approaches to work, which are required to adapt to change. Learning is central to capacity-development and so learning skills and related ???general skills??? are vital, but these skills must be developed in a specific context to be useful tools. Learning involves balancing the chaos of uncertainty and the old grooves of experience. Learning also involves personal growth. This study explores ways of helping workers develop capacity and especially learning skills, in a context of complexity, to meet the demands of their changing environment. The methodological approach taken is two fold, including both a conceptual and an empirical component. Firstly, a framework, based on conceptual innovation, is constructed to direct the design of workplace-based programs aimed at developing workers??? capacity. This is done as guidance in tailoring a program that promotes the development of an understanding of the necessary skills and knowledge in the context of the work undertaken, how to use them effectively, and the impact they have on the worker and their environment. It is contended that this framework promotes continued and sustained growth in workers??? skills and adaptability, that is, it develops capacity. Secondly, fieldwork based on a program developed for a group of tax administrators to instantiate this framework is reported. The findings show that this workplace-based program designed for the Australian Taxation Office has precipitated the development of the participant workers??? capacity, and in so doing, has shown the empirical significance of the conceptual innovation. Finally, the broader implications of developing workers??? capacity are explored. These include the need for organisational support for workers??? capacity-development, the possibility of the development of a learning culture in organisations, and the general applicability of the framework to other organisations, professions, and industries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tax administration and procedure -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Learning.</field><field name="subject">Organization.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro characterisation of the hepatitis C virus genotype 3a RNA dependent RNA polymerase</field><field name="creator">Clancy, Leighton Edward, Biotechnology And Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication is directed by NS5b, the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). To date, our understanding of the HCV polymerase has come almost entirely from genotype 1. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of sequence variation in the polymerase region by characterising a polymerase derived from genotype 3a.  The genotype 3a CB strain polymerase was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrcHis2C incorporating a hexahistidine tag to facilitate purification. An optimised process produced 2.5 mg of highly purified recombinant protein per litre of bacterial culture. The 3a preparation possessed an RdRp activity and could utilise both homopolymeric and heteropolymeric RNA templates. Optimal activity was seen at 30oC at pH 8 in reactions containing 160nM enzyme, 10??g/ml RNA template and 2.5mM MnCl2. Subsequently, three genotype 1b polymerases including the HCV-A, Con1 and JK1 strains were cloned for the comparison of activity under identical conditions. Steady state kinetic parameters for GMP incorporation revealed the 3a polymerase exhibited the highest activity, with an almost two fold higher catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) than HCVA-1b, primarily due to differences in Km for GTP (2.984??M vs 5.134??M). Furthermore, the 3a polymerase was 3.5 fold and 15 fold more active than JK1-1b and Con1-1b respectively. Improving our understanding of the influence of sequence difference on polymerase activity, particularly in the context of replication will be crucial to developing effective antiviral therapies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HCV.</field><field name="subject">NS5b.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus.</field><field name="subject">RNA polymerases.</field><field name="subject">Viruses -- Reproduction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terra Alterius: land of another</field><field name="creator">Farmer, Margaret, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">What would Australia be like if it had been recognised as terra alterius, ???land of another???, by the British, rather than claimed and treated as terra nullius, ???land of no-one???? This question was posed by the exhibition Terra Alterius: Land of Another, which comprised works by Gordon Bennett, Barbara Campbell-Allen, Julie Dowling, Shaun Gladwell + Michael Schiavello, Jonathan Jones, Joanne Searle, Esme Timbery, Freddie Timms, Lynette Wallworth, Guan Wei and Lena Yarinkura, created or nominated in response to the theme. This thesis describes the concept of terra alterius and the exhibition Terra Alterius: Land of Another. It considers the utility of the concept terra alterius, whether the exhibition achieved its ambition to explore the political and social terrain of a reconciled Australia, and, briefly, whether the concept of terra alterius might be useful to other ???terra nullius??? countries. It argues that the curatorial strategies ??? the ???What if???? re-imagination of Australia???s past, multiplicity of vision and active creation, grounding of the exhibition in affect (in response to Aboriginal painting), and working within Indigenous protocols ??? were effective, and that the exhibition was a useful means of exploring the relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Comparisons with the exhibition Turn the Soil curated by Kevin Murray and the ???retrospective utopia??? W.H. Oliver argues has been created for New Zealand by the Waitangi Tribunal provide insight into the nature of the reconciled Australia presented in the exhibition and what might be achieved by a counterfactual exhibition. From these comparisons, it is argued, first, that the exhibition points to a disjuncture between Australia???s ongoing official, psychological and legal terra nullius and the approaches and relationships present in Australian society (characterised as a performance of Bloch???s utopian function); and secondly, that a counterfactual exhibition, because it is not bound to the factual, causal or narrative qualities traditionally attributed to history, is able to explore the future in a way that contains rather than denies the past. Although the concept of terra alterius is seen as having played a crucial role in the realisation of the exhibition, it is questioned whether the concept???s utility extends beyond Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts -- Australia -- Exhibitions.</field><field name="subject">Arts -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of international corporate finance:  initial public offerings (IPOs); American depositary receipts (ADRs); and stock analysts? recommendations</field><field name="creator">Ng, David, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of empirical studies on various aspects of international corporate finance, a series of long-run event studies examining the abnormal stock return performance of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), and stock analyst recommendations. The first two of these, presented in Chapters 2 and 3, investigate the key issues relating to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). The next, in Chapter 4, examines the performance of new American Depositary Receipt issues from emerging markets and its determinants. The final study, presented in Chapter 5, assesses the value of stock analysts? recommendations in emerging markets. It is essentially a series of empirical studies adopting a tried and tested methodology, involving benchmarks, for measuring returns over time in emerging markets, a subject that has not been sufficiently investigated. The long-run event study approach is designed to identify anomalies in these markets, which may be much more pronounced than in developed markets. This thesis makes substantive contributions to the existing knowledge on measuring, documenting and determining various issues in international corporate finance, and provides methodological improvements over previous studies. Chapter 2 presents an examination of the stock return performance of the IPO stocks listed on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in Hong Kong, finding that the return performance is sensitive to the benchmark employed. Two main factors contributing to the underperformance of GEM stocks are the ?technology boom? and ?IPO effects?. Moreover, the results of cross-sectional analyses suggest that the Hong Kong GEM is a unique market; since at least 70 percent of the IPO stocks listed on the GEM are technology stocks, the ?technology? factor outweighs previous hypotheses advocated by previous researchers to explain the poor performance of newly listed stocks. Chapter 3 extends this analysis by turning attention to the post-issue stock price performance of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in Asian markets, using a comparative assessment of the stock performance of Asian IPOs motivated by the ongoing discovery of biases in event studies involving long horizon returns. Various methods were used to remove such biases, while examining the robustness of the long run performance of the IPOs. The results of this examination show that the existence of long run underperformance for the Asian IPOs depends on the methodology used. The study also assesses the ?Market Timing? theory with regard to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), adding to the growing literature that suggests that Asian firms time their issuance of equity securities. Chapter 4 presents a comparative study of the post-issue stock performance and operating performance of the Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) of American Depositary Receipts (ADR) in emerging markets. The results of this study suggest that ADR IPOs are underpriced, though not to the same extent as regular IPOs. In the aftermarket, ADR IPOs underperform the Emerging Market Index. However, after controlling for differences in size and industry, underperformance of ADR IPOs compared with both home market IPOs and US IPOs could not be demonstrated. The analysis of stock and operating performance yields consistent results; aside from the ?window dressing? effect, this also demonstrates that stock price performance is a reflection of operating performance over the long run. Chapter 5 presents the first study to examine post-recommendation abnormal returns in emerging markets, based on the Emerging Market Index adjusted model and the Controlling Firm approach, demonstrating that stock prices react significantly to recommendation revisions, both on the revision day and subsequently. In this cross-sectional analysis, it appears that the Market-to-Book ratio is the primary indicator for Buy and Strong Buy recommendations. This indicates that stock analysts in emerging markets prefer high growth stocks with their attractive characteristics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Finance.</field><field name="subject">Stocks -- Rate of return.</field><field name="subject">Investment analysis.</field><field name="subject">Going public (Securities)</field><field name="subject">American depositary receipts.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nothing personal</field><field name="creator">Chaitow, Tanya, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The autobiographical nature of my work deals with the space between the innocence of childhood and the wisdom of adulthood. I explore the complexities of personal experience, old and new landscapes and the scar tissue of memory. The work deals with beginnings and departures, relationships and conflict of power and vulnerability in the quest to make sense of life. My work connects with moments of childhood that I try to retain as a touchstone for authentic experience. The images are derived from personal and familial experiences, moving through to the universal to tell the human tale, using the human body as a metaphor. The body becomes the subject matter for expressing ideas about our universal and personal concerns. I explore the gulf between the real and the unreal through examining themes such as identity, vulnerability, anxiety, fear, alienation, abandonment, loss, corruption of innocence, love and death within a contemporary urban framework. These emotions are played out against the backdrop of daily domesticity and reflect the physical reality of the world around us, often exposing the contrast between the orderly veneer of our daily lives and our emotional reality. My work methodology uses narrative found in books, films, fairy tales or fables to explore the conflicting emotions which structure human identity and interaction. I use the stories as a way of approaching ideas or emotions and exploiting the story as a focus of cultural knowledge. In the search for emotional truth I draw parallels between my art practice and the search for authenticity within the theatre.  My work is an attempt to explain my own creative process in relation to the artists who have influenced me, my childhood, its rich tradition of storytelling and my passion for theatre and literature as well as a search for meaning in my own relationships and life's journey.

While negative attitudes towards school singing have been acknowledged as one of the factors contributing to the decline of singing in schools, these attitudes conflict directly with the socially acceptable, esteemed and desired status that children place on singing in the world in which they live.  Given the popularity of singing outside of school, negativity towards singing is of particular concern.  Identifying the factors that determine a child???s attitude towards singing in both the school and home context is crucial if positive attitudes towards singing are to be sustained through to adolescence.  The purpose of this research was to explore children???s attitudes towards singing in each stage level between Kindergarten and Year 6 in the home and school context, to identify the factors which determine positive and negative attitudes towards singing and to consider the relationships between attitudes in relation to gender. Interviews were conducted with 147 children between Kindergarten and Year 6 in five New South Wales public schools and attitudes towards singing were tested using a three point attitude measurement scale.  Further data were collected from 118 parents in order to gain an understanding of children???s singing experience within the home context.  Results showed that children???s preference to sing at home, rather than at school, increases with age.  While boys have a stronger preference to sing at home than girls, girls are more positive towards school singing.  Relational reasons such as fear of criticism and singing in front of others were central reasons for children???s dislike of school singing.  While children across all stage levels enjoy singing with CD???s and singing on their own, boys??? particularly enjoy having ownership over song choice and composing their own songs.  Lack of song choice and singing in front of others evokes negative attitudes towards singing.  Teachers have a strong influence on attitudes towards singing at ES1 and Stage 1 level, however by Year 6, there is a strong correlation between parents and children???s attitudes towards singing. These results provide new insights and implications for the teaching of singing in schools.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Singing.</field><field name="subject">School children -- Attitudes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29583</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retroviral transfer of BCR-ABL Ribozyme sequences to primary human chronic myeloid leukaemia cells</field><field name="creator">Presgrave, Peter John, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) is a clonal haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder characterised by the presence of a disease-specific gene, BCR-ABL, which leads to the production of a bcr-abl mRNA transcript. CML is an ideal candidate for gene therapy using ribozymes (Rz), catalytic RNA molecules that cleave and inactivate target RNA in a sequence specific manner. Limited data is available on the activity of ribozymes in human CML cells. In this study, hammerhead ribozyme sequences directed against the b3a2 bcr-abl mRNA sequence (Rz6-Rz10) were cloned into several retroviral vectors. Initial experiments using MSCVHSA based retroviral constructs failed to express the sequences in cell lines. Rz cDNA fragments were then cloned into an LNL6 based retroviral vector (LGL1) encoding a GFP reporter gene and stable LGLRz constructs produced.  Using cell sorting, high-titre PA317 producer cell line clones were isolated. Transcriptional silencing of the LGLRz6 producer cell line occurred with prolonged culture, with partial reversal on treatment with the demethylating agent 5' azacytidine. To assess the activity of these constructs in human cells, CD34+ HSC were isolated from newly diagnosed b3a2 Ph+ CML patients. Cells were transduced with either control LGL vector or the LGLRz6 construct. Transduced human cells were sorted based on GFP expression and placed into long-term HSC culture (LTC-IC assays). Using a common cDNA, RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of both the transgene and bcr-abl in individual colonies derived from the LTCIC assay at various time points, allowing assessment of the effect of transgene expression on bcr-abl expression. LGLRz transgene expression was detectable for up to 6 weeks in culture. Colony RT-PCR results from 3 patients showed that expression of the LGLRz6 construct was associated with decreased bcr-abl expression. It also appeared that the reduced bcr-abl expression decreased the proliferation of Ph+ cells leading to their loss from culture. In summary, these results appear to show an effect of a retroviral vector containing a bcr-abl Rz sequence on human CML HSC. Targeting of bcr-abl remains a valid therapeutic goal in the Imatinib era, particularly if problems related to effective ribozyme delivery and targeting can be overcome.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myeloid leukemia.</field><field name="subject">Catalytic RNA.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding creativity through memes and schemata</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Julie, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">When it comes to the notion of creativity, both R. Dawkins and D. Dennett argue that creativity is a matter of random mutation, in the same way that genes randomly mutate. Neither Dennett nor Dawkins see anything else in the mimetic theory of creativity than a process of Darwinian evolution. However, this complete reliance upon the extension of evolution for understanding creativity needs to be supplemented by combining it with other ideas such as those of "schema theory," because creativity always occurs within a structured context and is not simply a matter of random mutation of ideas. Schema theory comes largely from the works of E.H Gombrich, who argued that "schemas" play a crucial role in how it is that we are able to be creative. He defines schemas as structure and traditions in society that help to convey the meaning of our creative efforts. Just as semantics needs syntax within language in order to formulate and convey meaning, so by analogy memes need schemas for the creation and expression of new ideas. Rather than being the antithesis of creativity, existing forms of expression and traditions are important for the creation of new ideas. This needs to be factored into any theory of creativity in order to account for the effect of the social context on creative endeavours in addition to a Darwinian account of memes. The unconscious processes at work within the brain that are involved in the generation of ideas and other creative products can be understood using the notion of a "generator", as originally conceived by D. Dennett. This notion goes beyond mere concrete Skinnerian behavioural trial and error. Within this generator, there appear to be at work processes such as those of bisociation and association, as discussed by A. Koestler, as well as processes such as the role of language, memory, generate-and-test and intentionality that must be acknowledged in addition to the syntactic operations of schemas and the replicating contents of memes. The operation of all of these ingredients within the generator, when understood together, can be seen as responsible for our ability to be creative.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative ability.</field><field name="subject">Memetics.</field><field name="subject">Schematism (Philosophy)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gustatory effects of dietary fat</field><field name="creator">Song, Hae-Jin, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates whether fats, akin to other taste stimuli, exhibit sensory properties such as mixture interactions. In order to determine gustatory, rather than tactile or olfactory effects, viscosity-controlled emulsions of deodorised oils were used as the base to which taste stimuli were incorporated and presented to a panel of trained assessors.  In preliminary qualitative assessments, panellists described the 10% olive oil emulsion as saltier, stronger, fattier and having a more lingering aftertaste than the non-oil control, suggesting that oil modulates taste duration as well influencing taste intensity and/or perceived quality. Panellists were unable to rate the oil/fat taste per se with any degree of certainty hence further experiments examined the effect of oil on the perception of taste mixtures. In mixture interaction experiments, the addition of oil did not result in mixture suppression or enhancement for sweet, salty, sour or bitter while it significantly enhanced umami. To determine the locus of interaction, when MSG and oil were presented to each side of the tongue separately, the enhancement effect disappeared indicating a peripheral mechanism of interaction, similar to the attenuation of chilli burn by oil. In contrast, suprathreshold sucrose sweetness was enhanced by the contralateral presentation of oil, indicating sensory processing at a higher locus. Furthermore, the addition of oil significantly reduced bitterness in a caffeine-MSG mixture. Since earlier experiments did not indicate any interaction between oil and bitterness, the decrease in the perceived bitterness of this binary mixture is attributed to an increase in umami which is likely to have suppressed bitterness, the perceptually dominant component in this mixture. These findings suggest a gustatory role for fats in modulating the taste profile of mixtures, in particular, enhancing total taste intensity, prolonging taste duration, and enhancing umami. A taste receptor-based model of fat perception provides for an orosensory mechanism capable of signalling the arrival of the most energy-dense nutrient, essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. The chemosensory signal may also be the basis for hedonic responses with subsequent implications for intake.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Low-fat diet</field><field name="subject">Oils and fats, Edible</field><field name="subject">Taste</field><field name="subject">Chemoreceptors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic management of artificial watering points for biodiversity conservation</field><field name="creator">Montague-Drake, Rebecca, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since pastoralism began in Australia???s rangelands, the number of artificial watering points (AWPs) has increased dramatically, such that today, few areas of rangeland are further than 10 km from water. This increased availability of water has caused many ecological impacts. Unfortunately, such impacts are poorly understood in the context of an Australian conservation reserve, thus hindering strategic management. This study examined the spatial distribution of vertebrate (kangaroos, small mammals, lizards and avifauna) and vegetative variables around open AWPs as well as AWPs that have been closed since pastoralism (sheep-grazing) ceased nearly thirty years ago in Sturt National Park, arid New South Wales. The study also examined vertebrate use of AWPs, with a particular emphasis on kangaroos and avifauna. The study revealed that most variables showed few differences in spatial distribution with distance from open and closed AWPs, thus suggesting that the observed piospheric impacts were primarily attributable to historical sheep-grazing. Indeed, piospheric patterns were weak suggesting some recovery over the last thirty years. That kangaroos did not exhibit water-focused grazing is no surprise, since despite their regular use of AWPs, particularly during hot, dry times, the current spatial arrangement of AWPs facilitates regular travel to, and from, such resources allowing kangaroos, like much other fauna, to distribute themselves in relation to food and shelter preferences rather than in relation to water supply. In contrast, the majority of avifaunal groups (excluding ground-dwelling species) were clustered around open AWPs, often irrespective of season, because of food and water requirements. Such spatial concentrations of avifauna are thought to cause a range of interspecific effects. Experimental AWP closure and GIS modelling showed that whilst closure of AWPs will increase the average distance to water, which will have key benefits, the majority of areas in Sturt National Park would still be accessible to most water-dependent species even if all unused AWPs were closed. Strategic retention of AWPs to replace water sources lost since European settlement, aid threatened and migratory species??? conservation and enhance nature-based tourism opportunities is thus recommended and an example of a strategic management and monitoring plan outlined.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity</field><field name="subject">watering points</field><field name="subject">piosphere</field><field name="subject">rangeland conservation</field><field name="subject">arid zone</field><field name="subject">kangaroos</field><field name="subject">avifauna</field><field name="subject">small mammals</field><field name="subject">reptiles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performative architecture: design strategies for living bodies</field><field name="creator">Spurr, Sam, School of English, Media &amp; Performance Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Under the title 'Performative Architecture', this thesis draws on theories from performance studies and phenomenology in order to look beyond humanist practices that see the body as fixed and static. This thesis addresses two questions that I will be arguing are of increasing significance to contemporary architecture: Firstly, in the context of emerging digital and digitised spaces, how does the living body interact with the surrounding environment?; and secondly, what do these changing forms of human inhabitation and movement mean for the practice of architecture? The time frame spans from the work of Oskar Schlemmer in the 1920s to contemporary built works, examining the different ways that performativity has infiltrated architectural design. The case studies are divided into architectural performances that highlight the living body, and performative drawings that explore how to bring that body into the design process. In doing so a number of emerging paradigms become apparent that find built form in contemporary architectural examples. This approach is used to describe and analyse recent projects by Daniel Libeskind, Peter Eisenman, Diller and Scofidio and Lars Spuybroek, and to identify a common orientation through very different types of built environments. Acknowledging the change in both bodies and spaces in the Information Age, this research seeks to make room for the living body in the design of emerging, multidimensional, built environments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architectural design.</field><field name="subject">Architecture -- Human factors.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the basolateral amygdala in learning and  relearning context conditioned fear and its extinction.</field><field name="creator">Laurent, Vincent, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is a key component of the neuronal circuitry underlying the acquisition and the extinction of Pavlovian conditioned fear. The present series of experiments examined the role of neuronal activity and NMDA receptors (NMDAr) activation in the BLA on learning and relearning context conditioned fear and its extinction. Disruption of neuronal activity in the BLA prevented the acquisition of fear responses to a novel, a moderately familiar or a highly familiar context. It also prevented the reacquisition of fear responses to a conditioned or an extinguished context. Local blockade of NMDAr containing the NR2B subunit prior to training extinction or re-extinction impaired the short- and long-term loss of fear responses. In contrast, a similar blockade subsequent to training extinction or re-extinction left the long-term loss of fear responses unaffected. Disruption of neuronal activity in the BLA prior to training extinction and re-extinction depressed fear responses. It impaired the long-term loss of fear produced by extinction training but spared and even facilitated the long-loss of fear produced by re-extinction training when extinction had already been learned. The exact same outcome was observed when neuronal activity in the BLA was disrupted subsequent to training extinction and re-extinction. These findings suggest that the BLA is critical for both learning and relearning context conditioned fear. In contrast, the BLA is necessary for learning but not relearning extinction of conditioned fear. This implies that once extinction has been learned, others structures support the retrieval and the expression of extinction memory. This is consistent with current neural model of extinction that involves interactions between several neural substrates including the BLA and the medial prefrontal cortex.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fear conditioning.</field><field name="subject">Extinction.</field><field name="subject">Learning.</field><field name="subject">Relearning.</field><field name="subject">Amygdaloid body.</field><field name="subject">Conditioned response.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cranial variation of contemporary East Asians in a global context</field><field name="creator">Green, Hayley, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current study examines cranial variation of contemporary East Asians with an aim to comprehensively describe and define the morphology of people in this region. In doing so, a better understanding of the causes of variation within East Asia and compared to other geographic populations is sought. The study encompasses a broad range of samples from Northeast Asia to island Southeast Asia. Traditional linear and angular data and analytical methods (e.g Box and Whisker, Principal Components Analysis) were used to assess cranial variation. Thus the results may be compared to published studies using traditional craniometric approaches. Innovative geometric morphometric data collection and analysis techniques are also used here for the first time. Results show East Asians are distinguishable from non-Asians on the basis of their tall, round, vault, shorter cranial length, tall faces that are flattened in the upper and mid-facial regions, short malars (anteroposterior length), narrow interorbital breadth and orthognathism. A north-south East Asian cline was also detected, with the northern samples exhibiting tall, orthognathic faces, and a long low vault. This long, low vault shape is in contradiction to the purported shape of cold-climate adapted populations. Southern East Asians possess a tall, rounded vault and a short, projecting (prognathic) face. Island Southeast Asians inhabiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands exhibit a 'mixed' morphology, possessing the southern East Asian facial form, but the long, low vault seen in northern East Asian samples. The long, low vault also characterises non-Asian samples from Australia, Africa and Melanesia. Shape differences were significantly associated with latitude, explaining most of the variation. The identification of ancestral East Asian features in recent samples suggests phylogenetics may also be contributing to variation in part. The study concludes that there is clear evidence for geographical variation among modern East Asians, some if it being continuous (clinal) and some discontinuous. Importantly, much of the variation reflects adaptation to climate, with a phylogenetic component also recognised. The study contributes to our understanding of human evolution in a region that today constitutes around half of the world?s population.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Craniology -- East Asia.</field><field name="subject">Anatomy, Comparative.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic evaluation of environmental impacts of industrial products</field><field name="creator">Manmek, Suphunnika, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Environmental costs of products are closely related to their environmental impacts incurred at all life cycle stages of a product. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methods are often used to estimate these environmental costs and impacts. However, LCA analysis is known to be a costly and time-consuming method, whereas LCC analysis often neglects the social cost which is currently paid by society as a whole. Therefore, this research proposes a new methodology to assess the environmental impact and social cost for the entire life cycle of a product, which can be used as a simple and transparent tool for the early conceptual design stage. The methodology delivers the Environmental Impact Drivers and the associated Social Cost Drivers for all product life cycle stages via spreadsheets, and it provides the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method in the SimaPro software as a user interface. Furthermore, the drivers provide the values for four different geographical regions and damage categories. The conceptual model is based on the impact pathway approach which integrates the Simplified LCA (SLCA) model and the social cost databases. The SLCA model is derived from an extension of previous research whereas the social costs are based on the most suitable Economic Valuation (EV) studies such as the EPS2000d, EXMOD, Ecosense and Asian EV studies. The data collection for the SLCA database was accomplished by using the LCA analysis of the Eco Indicator 99 H/A method and the Hierarchical clustering technique. The data for the social cost database was collected using the Benefit Transfer Method which obtains the EV studies mainly from the Environmental Valuation Reference Inventory (EVRI) data source. Several case studies utilising existing products, including a product redesign case study were used to prove the concept and demonstrate the efficiency of this proposed methodology.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial ecology -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Environmental impact analysis.</field><field name="subject">Product life cycle -- Environmental aspects.</field><field name="subject">Product management.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of designers' cultural preferences on product concepts</field><field name="creator">Razzaghi, Mohammad, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Products are designed to satisfy user needs. Thus, industrial designers are expected to have a thorough understanding of user needs and to incorporate those understandings into the design of products; however, it is not a straightforward task for designers to translate their conditional understanding into a product. The gap between product and user can be even wider when latent user needs, such as cultural ones, are calculated into the problem. Therefore the meanings and functions imbued in products by the designer may not be recognized and acknowledged by users, due to the differences in cultural preferences of designers and users from separate cultures. In spite of the fact that user satisfaction has been extensively supported in the design literature, it seems that such an approach allows only a passive role for designers, who actually act as cultural intermediaries; that is, the designers' role is merely presumed to catalyze the process and match user requirements to the end product. Thus, the impact of designers' cultural preferences is considered as incidental, or at least overlooked. A content analysis method was triangulated to collect and analyze diverse visual and textual data relating to the concept generation stage of the product development process. To collect data, professional industrial designers in the two culturally diverse countries of Australia and Iran were recruited to participate in half-hour design exercise sessions to sketch to a design brief, followed by responding to an interview questionnaire. The analysis of data revealed that: (1) designers' cultural preferences do influence their approaches toward tackling the design problem; (2) there are nexuses between the design aspects of the concepts generated and the cultural dimensions of the values of the societies in which the designers were born and has lived, and; (3)potential users can unconsciously comprehend the meaning invested in the product by the designer. This thesis breaks new ground for further advancing the study of the Designer-Precedent Approach (DPA) in other cultural and social contexts, while it challenges the conventional approaches of user-centered design (UCD) broadlyperceived as the ultimate method of incorporating users' wants into products.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design, Industrial -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Design, Industrial -- Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Industrial designers -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Creative ability in technology -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the intertrial interval in the loss of context conditioned fear responses.</field><field name="creator">Li, Sophie Huk Lahn, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Eight experiments examined the role of the intertrial interval in the extinction of conditioned fear to a context. Rats were shocked in one context (A) but not in another (B) and freezing responses to Context A were extinguished. The interval between extinction trials was spent in the home cages. Experiments 1a and 1b showed that massed extinction trials produced better response loss but worse learning than spaced trials. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the interval between the final extinction trial and test mediated the level of responding on a test exposure. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that the duration of the extinction trial affected long term response loss, whereby long durations facilitate response loss compared to shorter durations. Subsequent experiments (Experiments 5 to 8) demonstrated that the first in the series of massed extinction trials reduced the associability of subsequent trials. Associability was restored by alternating extinction trials between Context A and Context B. The results are discussed in terms of the role accorded to self-generated priming in the models developed by A. R.

In the problem, the evader has two advantages: a higher manoeuvrability and that the pursuer is uncertain about the evader??s state. Cooperation among multiple pursuer vehicles can thus be used to overcome the evader??s advantages. The focus here is on the formulation and development of frameworks and algorithms for cooperation amongst pursuers, aiming at feasible implementation on real and autonomous vehicles. The thesis is split into Parts I and II. Part I considers the problem of capturing an evader of higher manoeuvrability in a deterministic PE game. The approach is the employment of Forward Reachable Set (FRS) analysis in the pursuers?? control. The analysis considers the coverage of the evader??s FRS, which is the set of reachable states at a future time, with the pursuer??s FRS and assumes that the chance of capturing the evader is dependent on the degree of the coverage. Using the union of multiple pursuers?? FRSs intuitively leads to more evader FRS coverage and this forms the mechanism of cooperation. A framework for cooperative control based on the FRS coverage, or FRS-based control, is proposed. Two control algorithms were developed within this framework. Part II additionally introduces the problem of evader state uncertainty due to noise and limited field-of-view of the pursuers?? sensors. A search-and-capture (SAC) problem is the result and a hybrid architecture, which includes multi-sensor estimation using the Particle Filter as well as FRS-based control, is proposed to accomplish the SAC task. The two control algorithms in Part I were tested in simulations against an optimal guidance algorithm. The results show that both algorithms yield a better performance in terms of time and miss distance. The results in Part II demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid architecture for the SAC task. The proposed frameworks and  algorithms provide insights for the development of effective and more efficient control of pursuer vehicles and can be useful in the practical applications such as defence systems and civil law enforcement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pursuit-evasion</field><field name="subject">Cooperative control</field><field name="subject">Forward reachable set</field><field name="subject">Particle filter</field><field name="subject">Autonomous search</field><field name="subject">Recursive Bayesian estimation</field><field name="subject">Differential games.</field><field name="subject">Control theory.</field><field name="subject">Algorithms.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in an externally irradiated immobilized catalyst bubble column photoreactor: mass transfer and activity evaluation.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Ivy Ai Ling, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Light intensity distribution studies in the heterogeneous photocatalytic reactors were carried out successfully with potassium ferrioxalate chemical actinometry, reproducible light intensity estimates of the irradiation source were obtained.

This thesis presents an analysis of the ways that two professional groups, one clinical and one ancillary, at a single hospital cooperatively engage in a work practice that has recently been computerised. It investigates the way that a clinical group???s approach to and actual use of the system creates problems for the ancillary group. It understands these problems to arise from the contrasting ways that the groups position their use of documentation technology in their local definitions of professional status. The data on which analysis of these practices is based includes 16 hours of video recordings of the work practices of the two groups as they engage with the technology in their local work settings as well as video recordings of a reflexive viewing session conducted with participants from the ancillary group. Also included in the analysis are observational field notes, interviews and documentary analysis. The analysis aimed to produce a set of themes grounded in the specifics of the data, and drew on TLSTranscription?? software for the management and classification of video data. This thesis seeks to contribute to three research fields: health informatics, sociology of professions and social science research methodology. In terms of health informatics, this thesis argues for the necessity for health care information technology design to understand and incorporate the work practices of all professional groups who will be involved in using the technology system or whose work will be affected by its introduction. In terms of the sociology of professions, this thesis finds doctors and scientists to belong to two distinct occupational communities that each utilise documentation technology to different extents in their displays of professional competence.

The cellular industry has decided to combat this problem by using IPv6 for all new terminals. However, the success of 3G network deployment will depend on the services offered to end users. Currently, almost all services reside in the IPv4 address space, making them inaccessible to users in IPv6 networks. Thus, an intermediate translation mechanism is required. Previous studies on network address translation methods have shown that Realm Base Kluge Address Heuristic-IP, REBEKAH-IP supports all types of services that can be offered to IPv6 hosts from the public IPv4 based Internet, and provides excellent scalability. However, the method suffers from an ambiguity problem which may lead to call blocking. This thesis presents an improvement to REBEKAH-IP scheme in which the side effect is removed, creating a robust and fully scalable system. The improvement can be divided into two major tasks including a full investigation on the scalability of addressing and improvements to the REBEKAH-IP scheme that allow it to support important features such as ICMP and IP mobility. To address the first task a method called REBEKAH-IP with Port Extension (RPX) is introduced. RPX is extended from the original REBEKAH-IP scheme to incorporate centralised management of both IP address and port numbers. This method overcomes the ambiguity problem, and improves scalability. We propose a priority queue algorithm to further increase scalability. Finally, we present extensive simulation results on the practical scalability of RPX with different traffic compositions, to provide a guideline of the expected scalability in large-scale networks. The second task concerns enabling IP based communication. Firstly, we propose an ICMP translation mechanism which allows the RPX server to support important end-toend control functions. Secondly, we extend the RPX scheme with a mobility support scheme based on Mobile IP. In addition, we have augmented Mobile IP with a new tunneling mechanism called IP-in-FQDN tunneling. The mechanism allows for unique mapping despite the sharing of IP addresses while maintaining the scalability of RPX. We examine the viability of our design through our experimental implementation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet addresses</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Internetworking (Telecommunication)</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimum resonance changer for submerged vessel signature reduction.</field><field name="creator">Dylejko, Paul Griffin, School of Mechanical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In maritime vessels, it is desirable to minimise the structural and acoustic responses for several reasons, including passenger comfort, minimisation of crew fatigue, and in the case of military vessels, to avoid detection. The propeller-shafting system represents one of the most critical areas which must be addressed in order to reduce the low frequency acoustic signature. The propeller-shafting system is primarily excited by axial oscillations at the propeller. The force transmitted along the propeller-shafting system from these disturbances results in axial excitation of the hull and subsequent sound radiation. The aim of this thesis is to apply a combination of passive and active control techniques, in order to minimise the low frequency radiated noise signature of a pressure hull submerged in a fluid.  Dynamic models of the propeller-shafting system, foundation and cylindrical hull including complicating factors such as fluid loading, bulkheads and onboard equipment are developed and described using the transmission matrix approach. This modular description enables greater flexibility for dynamic modelling of the propeller shafting system, and can be easily manipulated for future design modifications. The far-field radiated sound pressure from the submarine hull is evaluated and related to the force delivered to the hull by the propeller-shafting system. A passive optimisation scheme involving a genetic and general non-linear constrained algorithm is used to minimise fitness functions associated with the vibration of the propeller, vibration transmission to the hull and far-field radiated sound pressure over a low frequency range. This results in optimal resonance changer parameters for single and multiple resonance changers in a variety of configurations.  A new quasi-adaptive resonance changer system is proposed and optimised to minimise the radiated sound pressure or propeller velocity. The optimal use of an adaptive resonance changer is investigated in both the frequency and time domains to reduce the hull velocity and subsequently the far-field radiated sound pressure. Fully active control is also evaluated by introducing a control force to the resonance changer with the aim of minimising either the propeller velocity or the radiated noise level. Finally, the concept of hybrid control is investigated by coupling passive, active and semi-active control techniques together to improve the overall performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Submarines (Ships) -- Noise.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guanxi in Inter-firm relationship management in China.</field><field name="creator">Li, Xiaobei, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The interaction of the personnel boundary in inter-firm relationship management is viewed as particularistic in China instead of universalistic as in many Western cultures. Specifically, guanxi networks, the Chinese system of inter-personal relationship, have strong strategic implications for business interactions. The practices of guanxi and the social norms associated with guanxi are complicated. On the one hand, guanxi practices can be traced back to Confucianism; on the other hand, guanxi???s significance has been changing in line with China???s economic reform. In this research, we have attempted to find what presently constitutes good guanxi in inter-firm relationship management against this dynamic backdrop. Additionally, from the transaction cost economies (TCE) perspective, we provide an analysis that guanxi-based business practices offer transaction cost advantages as an alternative to market-based practices. We argue that such advantages partially result from guanxi???s effect on the reduction of opportunist behaviors. Backed up by 97 questionnaire responses from firms in Shanghai and 15 semi-structured interviews, our study confirms that, in inter-firm relationships management, trust, affection and long-term orientation are features of close guanxi. To enhance guanxi quality, familiarization by self-disclosure and the presence of mutual benefits are also necessary, providing practical implications for business practitioners in China. Our study also indicates that guanxi business partners are expected to be obligational in business and flexible in contingencies. Opportunistic behaviors can be mitigated by adopting guanxi practices, supporting the TCE logic. In an absence of a rationalized legal system, guanxi may fill the gaps in the enforcement of the written contract.N</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business networks -- China</field><field name="subject">Interorganizational relations -- China</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal relations -- China</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture -- China</field><field name="subject">Industrial sociology -- China</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanostructured materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production using sunlight.</field><field name="creator">Glasscock, Julie Anne, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Solar hydrogen has the potential to replace fossil fuels with a sustainable energy carrier that can be produced from sunlight and water via &amp;quotewater splitting&amp;quote. This study investigates the use of hematite (Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3) as a photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 has a narrow indirect band-gap, which allows the utilization of a substantial fraction of the solar spectrum. However, the water splitting efficiencies for Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 are still low due to poor absorption characteristics, and large losses due to recombination in the bulk and at the surface.  The thesis investigates the use of nanostructured composite electrodes, where thin films of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 are deposited onto a nanostructured metal oxide substrate, in order to overcome some of the factors that limit the water splitting efficiency of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3.  Doped (Si, Ti) and undoped Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 thin films were prepared using vacuum deposition techniques, and their photoelectrochemical, electrical, optical and structural properties were characterised. The doped Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 exhibited much higher photoelectrochemical activity than the undoped material, due to an improvement of the surface transfer coefficient and some grain boundary passivation. Schottky barrier modeling of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 thin films showed that either the width of the depletion region or the diffusion length is the dominant parameter with a value around 30 nm, and confirmed that the surface charge transfer coefficient is small. An extensive review of the conduction mechanisms of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 is presented.  ZnO and SnO&amp;sub2 nanostructures were investigated as substrates for the Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 thin films. Arrays of well-aligned high aspect ratio ZnO nanowires were optimised via the use of nucleation seeds and by restricting the lateral growth of the nanostructures.  The geometry of the nanostructured composite electrodes was designed to maximise absorption and charge transfer processes. Composite nanostructured electrodes showed lower quantum efficiencies than equivalent thin films of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3, though a relative enhancement ofcollection of long wavelength charge carriers was observed, indicating that the nanostructured composite electrode concept is worthy of further investigation. The rate-limiting step for water splitting with Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 is not yet well understood and further investigations of the surface and bulk charge transfer properties are required in order to design electrodes to overcome specific shortcomings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">photoelectrochemical water splitting</field><field name="subject">hematite</field><field name="subject">nanostructure</field><field name="subject">vacuum deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stroke risk factors, outcomes and models of stroke care in a culturally and linguistically Diverse (CALD) elderly population.</field><field name="creator">Shen, Qing, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide. The majority of stroke patients are elderly. Advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, smoking and heavy alcohol drinking are the major risk factors. Treatment of modifiable risk factors is an important strategy for primary and secondary stroke prevention.  The primary aim of this thesis was to examine stroke risk factor profile, risk factor management and clinical outcomes, as well as their association with ethnicity (defined as English-speaking background ? ESB, and non-English-speaking background - NESB) in a group of elderly patients from a multiethnic background.  Stroke risk factor profile and outcomes of stroke were similar between English and non-English-speaking background patients. However, a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the NESB patient group was observed in the study (41% vs. 10% in the ESB patient group) (Chapter 2). In addition, predictive factors and predictive models for stroke outcomes were developed. Advanced age, visual field loss and stroke type were the main predictors for mortality and functional dependency at 12 months post-stroke (Chapter 3). Delirium occurred in one quarter of the elderly patient post-stroke and was also associated with a worse clinical outcome (Chapter 4).  Risk factor management may be suboptimal in elderly patients. For example, anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation was underused, particularly in NESB patients (Chapter 2). The reasons for under-usage of anticoagulant therapy were investigated in a general practitioner survey (Chapter 6). Results showed that NESB, older age, cognitive impairment (especially living alone) were significant potential barriers for anticoagulant prescription by general practitioners. Stroke units have been proven to be a better care model for stroke patients, with shortened hospital length of stay and improved clinical outcomes. Clinical audits from Bankstown Combined (Co-located) Acute and Rehabilitation Stroke Unit and later the newly established Blacktown Combined Co-located Stroke Unit have demonstrated these benefits (Chapter 5). However, further studies need to be performed in order to determine whether a combined co-located stroke unit care model is superior to other stroke unit care models, and if so, the reasons behind this.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease.</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Patients -- Rehabilitation.</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Patients -- Care.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40872</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular- and culturebased approaches to unraveling the chemical cross-talk between Delisea pulchra and Ruegeria strain R11</field><field name="creator">Case, Rebecca, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Delisea pulchra is a red macroalga that produces furanones, a class of secondary metabolites that inhibit the growth and colonization of a range of micro- and macroorganisms. In bacteria, furanones specifically inhibit acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)- driven quorum sensing, which is known to regulate a variety of colonization and virulence traits. This thesis aims to unveil multiple aspects of the chemically mediated interactions between an alga and its bacterial flora. It was demonstrated that the quorum sensing genetic machinery of bacteria is laterally transferred, making traditional 16S rRNA gene based-diversity techniques poorly suited to identify quorum sensing species. Previous studies had shown that AHL-producing bacteria belonging to the roseobacter clade can be readily isolated from D. pulchra. Because of this, it was decided to use a roseobacter epiphytic isolate from this alga, Ruegeria strain R11, to conduct a series of colonization experiments on furanone free and furanone producing D. pulchra. Furanones were shown to inhibit Ruegeria strain R11's colonization and infection of D. pulchra. In addition, it was demonstrated that Ruegeria strain R11 has temperature-regulated virulence, similar to what is seen for the coral pathogen Vibrio shiloi. Rising ocean temperatures may explain bleached D. pulchra specimens recently observed at Bare Island, Australia. To assess whether quorum sensing is common within the roseobacter clade, cultured isolates from the Roseobacter, Ruegeria and Roseovarius genera were screened for AHL production. Half of the bacteria screened produced the quorum sensing signal molecules, AHLs. These AHLs were identified using an overlay of an AHL reporter strain in conjunction with thin layer chromatography (TLC). The prevalence of quorum sensing within the roseobacter clade, suggests that these species may occupy marine niches where cellular density is high (such as surface associated communities on substratum and marine eukaryotes). Diversity studies in marine microbial communities require appropriate molecular markers. The 16S rRNA gene is the most commonly used marker for molecular microbial ecology studies. However, it has several limitations and shortcomings, to which attention has been drawn here. The rpoB gene is an alternate ???housekeeping??? gene used in molecular microbial ecology. Therefore, the phylogenetic properties of these two genes were compared. At most taxonomic levels the 16S rRNA and rpoB genes offer similar phylogenetic resolution. However, the 16S rRNA gene is unable to resolve relationships between strains at the subspecies level. This lack of resolving power is shown here to be a consequence of intragenomic heterogeneity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine chemical ecology</field><field name="subject">Marine metabolites</field><field name="subject">Delisea pulchra</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="subject">Marine algae</field><field name="subject">Cell interaction</field><field name="subject">Red algae</field><field name="subject">Bacteria -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Marine biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated feature recognition system for supporting engineering activities downstream of conceptual design.</field><field name="creator">Jones, Timothy, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transfer of information between CAD models and downstream manufacturing process planning software typically involves redundant user interaction. Many existing tools are process-centric and unsuited for selection of a  "best process" in the context of existing concurrent engineering design tools. A computer based Feature-Recognition (FR) process is developed to extract critical manufacturing features from engineering product CAD models. FR technology is used for automating the extraction of data from CAD product models and uses wire-frame geometry extracted from an IGES neutral file format. Existing hint-based feature recognition techniques have been extended to encompass a broader range of manufacturing domains than typical in the literature, by utilizing a combination of algorithms, each successful at a limited range of features. Use of wire-frame models simplifies product geometry and has the potential to support rapid manufacturing shape evaluation at the conceptual design stage. Native CAD files are converted to IGES neutral files to provide geometry data marshalling to remove variations in user modelling practice, and to provide a consistent starting point for FR operations. Wire-frame models are investigated to reduce computer resources compared to surface and solid models, and provide a means to recover intellectual property in terms of manufacturing design intent from legacy and contemporary product models. Geometric ambiguity in regard to what is ?solid? and what is not has plagued wire-frame FR development in the past. A new application of crossing number theory (CNT) has been developed to solve the wire-frame ambiguity problem for a range of test parts. The CNT approach works  satisfactorily for products where all faces of the product can be recovered and is tested using a variety of mechanical engineering parts.  Platform independent tools like Extensible Mark-up Language are used to capture data from the FR application and provide a means to separate FR and decision support applications. Separate applications are composed of reusable software modules that may be combined as required. Combining rule-based and case-based reasoning provides decision support to the manufacturing application as a means of rejecting unsuitable processes on functional and economic grounds while retaining verifiable decision pathways to satisfy industry regulators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Expert systems (Computer science) -- Industrial applications.</field><field name="subject">CAD/CAM systems.</field><field name="subject">Computer integrated manufacturing systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear behaviour of shallow concrete arches with  elastically restrained supports</field><field name="creator">Wang, Tao, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the effects of elastic restraint at the supports on the behaviour of shallow concrete arches, and the time-dependent effects of shrinkage and creep of concrete on the nonlinear behaviour of shallow arches.  The nonlinear behaviour of shallow circular arches with elastic rotational restraints at each support and subjected to a uniformly distributed radial load is firstly investigated. A virtual work formulation is used to establish both the nonlinear equilibrium equations and the buckling equilibrium equation for shallow arches. The analytical results show that the effects of the stiffness of the rotational restraints on the prebuckling and buckling response are significant.  An analytical model is developed for the in-plane elastic stability analysis of shallow parabolic arches with horizontal spring supports subjected to a uniformly distributed vertical load. A parametric study is undertaken using the proposed analytical model. It is found that the effects of the stiffness of the horizontal springs on the prebuckling response, buckling load and buckling behaviour of arches are significant.  An analytical model is developed to simulate the time-dependent behaviour of shallow concrete parabolic arches with horizontal spring supports subjected to a sustained loading, and in particular to investigate creep buckling. The time-dependent buckling load and the critical time (or age) of the arches are calculated by using an iterative process based on the proposed model. A systematic parametric study is undertaken, and the results show that the various parameters have a profound effect on the time-dependent buckling load and the prebuckling life of arches.  Both short-term and long-term experimental investigations of shallow parabolic tied concrete arches are described and used to validate the analytical models. For the short-term tests, three concrete arches were subjected to a uniformly distributed vertical load and were loaded to failure. For the long-term tests, seven concrete arches were subjected to sustained service loads. The instantaneous and time-dependent deflections were recorded throughout the period of loading, together with the distribution of the horizontal thrust at the supports. Comparisons between the experimental results and the analytical predictions using the analytical models are made to verify the accuracy of the theoretical models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arches.</field><field name="subject">Load factor design.</field><field name="subject">Buckling (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Concrete arches.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The programming language TransLucid</field><field name="creator">Ditu, Gabriel Cristian, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents TransLucid, a low-level, purely declarative, intensional programming language. Built on a simple algebra and with just a small number of primitives, TransLucid programs define arbitrary dimensional infinite data structures, which are then queried to produce results. The formal foundations of TransLucid come from the work in intensional logic by Montague and Scott.  The background chapters give a history of intensional logic and its predecessors in the Western world, as well as a history of intensional programming and Lucid, the first intensional programming language.  The semantics of TransLucid are fully specified in the form of operational semantics. Three levels of semantics are given, in increasing order of efficiency, with the sequential warehouse semantics, the most efficient, being presented together with a proof that any expression will be evaluated by only examining relevant dimensions in the current context. The language is then extended in three important ways, by adding versioned identifiers, (declarative) side-effects and timestamped equations and demands.  Adding versioned identifiers to TransLucid enriches the expressiveness of the language and allows the encoding of a variety of programming paradigms, ranging from manipulating large data-cubes to pattern-matching.  Adding side-effects supports one of the main reasons for TransLucid: namely, to provide a target language, together with a methodology, for translating the main programming paradigms, thus creating a uniform end platform that can be the focus for optimisation and program verification. A translation of imperative programs into TransLucid is given.  Timestamped equations and demands enable TransLucid to become a language for synchronous programming in real-time systems, as well as allowing runtime updates to a program's equations.  The language TransLucid represents a decisive advance in declarative programming. It has applications in many fields of computer science and opens up exciting new avenues of research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TransLucid.</field><field name="subject">Lucid (Computer program language)</field><field name="subject">Intensional programming.</field><field name="subject">Cartesian programming.</field><field name="subject">Declarative programming.</field><field name="subject">Programming language semantics.</field><field name="subject">Programming language translation.</field><field name="subject">Modal logic.</field><field name="subject">Intensional logic.</field><field name="subject">Modality (Logic)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-purpose multi-way data analysis</field><field name="creator">Ebrahimi Mohammadi, Diako, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this dissertation, application of multi-way analysis is extended into new areas of environmental chemistry, microbiology, electrochemistry and organometallic chemistry. Additionally new practical aspects of some of the multi-way analysis methods are discussed.  Parallel Factor Analysis Two (PARAFAC2) is used to classify a wide range of weathered petroleum oils using GC-MS data. Various chemical and data analysis issues exist in the current methods of oil spill analysis are discussed and the proposed method is demonstrated to have potential to be employed in identification of source of oil spills. Two important practical aspects of PARAFAC2 are exploited to deal with chromatographic shifts and non-diagnostic peaks.GEneralized Multiplicative ANalysis Of VAriance (GEMANOVA) is applied to assess the bactericidal activity of new natural antibacterial extracts on three species of bacteria in different structure and oxidation forms and different concentrations. In this work while the applicability of traditional ANOVA is restricted due to the high interaction amongst the factors, GEMANOVA is shown to return robust and easily interpretable models which conform to the actual structure of the data.  Peptide-modified electrochemical sensors are used to determine three metal cations of Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ simultaneously. Two sets of experiments are performed using a four-electrode system returning a three-way array of size (sample ?? current ?? electrode) and a single electrode resulting in a two-way data set of size (sample ?? current). The data of former is modeled by N-PLS and that latter using PLS. Despite the presence of highly overlapped voltammograms and several sources of non-linearity N-PLS returns reasonable models while PLS fails.  An intramolecular hydroamination reaction is catalyzed by several organometallic catalysts to identify the most effective catalysts. The reaction of starting material in the presence of 72 different catalysts is monitored by UV-Vis at two time points, before and after heating the mixtures in an oven. PARAFAC is applied to the three-way data set of (sample ?? wavelength ?? time) to resolve the overlapped UV-Vis peaks and to identify the effective catalysts using the estimated relative concentration of product (loadings plot of the sample mode).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemometrics.</field><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis.</field><field name="subject">Principal comparisons (Statistics).</field><field name="subject">Chemistry -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="subject">Principal components analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liver-directed gene therapy for type 1 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Appavoo, Mathiyalagan, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Genetically engineered insulin-producing cells, surrogate ?? cells, offer a solution to the shortage of ?? cells available for transplantation in individuals with Type 1 diabetes. Hepatocytes are a promising starting cell in the quest for surrogate ?? cells. However, achieving glucose-regulated insulin secretion in the genetically engineered liver cells is a difficult task as liver cells do not possess regulated secretory pathway. NeuroD, a pancreatic ?? cell transcription factor is involved in the differentiation of endocrine pancreatic cells and also directly regulates the expression of genes in the differentiated cells. However, little is known about the role of NeuroD in the glucose-regulated insulin secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate whether NeuroD induces glucose-regulated insulin secretion in the insulin-producing rat liver cell line, FAO-ins. The human NeuroD gene was stably expressed in FAO-ins cells. In the transfected cells (FAOins-Nd) the expression of genes encoding transcription factor Foxa2, L-type calcium channel subunits and secretory granule protein CgA was up-regulated. FAOins-Nd also showed greater intracellular insulin content and secretion as well as released insulin in a regulated manner to calcium stimulus. Further, growth factors namely betacellulin, activin A, nicotinamide and exendin-4 as well as insulin secretagogues such as theophylline, IBMX and carbachol were examined by static incubation in inducing glucose-regulated insulin secretion. Exendin-4 and insulin secretagogues stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of 1.5 mM glucose but the addition of 20 mM glucose had no further stimulatory effect. These results indicate that FAOins-Nd cells are sensitive to glucose and the release of insulin is non-glucose dependent. Overexpression of NeuroD and further treatment with exendin-4 or insulin secretagogues up-regulated insulin secretion but did not render these cells glucose-responsive. An attempt was made to generate transgenic NOD mice expressing large amounts of insulin in the liver using PEPCK promoter with SV40 poly adenylation sequence. Transgenic NOD mice were generated and the presence of insulin transgene was demonstrated. However, insulin mRNA and protein were not expressed in the liver of transgenic mice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional calculus and coadjoint orbits.</field><field name="creator">Raffoul, Raed Wissam, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Let G be a compact Lie group and let &#960; be an irreducible representation of G of highest weight &#955;.

Prior to the announcement of Ardipithecus, only two genera were used by paleoanthropologists: Australopithecus and Homo. Presently, up to eight hominin genera are used: Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Praeanthropus, Kenyanthropus, Paranthropus and Homo. Unlike species concepts, the genus category has not received wide critical examination. To investigate the use of the genus category in paleoanthropology, a comparative framework drawing on morphometric data from a large number of catarrhines is developed. Cranial variables include 36 standard linear measurements from representatives of catarrhine genera across the major tribes/families. This study seeks to assess whether too few or too many hominin genera have been recognized compared with extant catarrhines. Moreover, two published hypotheses about the use of Homo are examined: 1) Wood &amp; Collard's (1999) proposal to transfer Homo habilis/rudolfensis to Australopithecus; and 2) Goodman et al's (1998) classification of both humans and chimpanzees in Homo. To analyze these cranial variables and a number of shape indices calculated from them, as well as to assess competing hypotheses, univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical approaches are used.  The results allow the identification of a set of variables and shape indices which distinguish genera across the catarrhines. Importantly, body size seems to be the major separator of catarrhine genera, reinforcing the idea that they occupy discrete adaptive zones. Moreover, differences between these genera mostly represent contrasts in the size of the neuroversus the viscerocranium. When applied to hominins, a picture emerges which distinguishes them from extant catarrhines: cranial shape rather than size is the major component distinguishing them; this suggests that extinct hominins occupied similar habitats and adaptive zones; variability in size and shape within hominin genera is much lower than extant catarrhines; and the major differences seen in shape among hominins are the result of encephalization in Homo. It is concluded here that both Wood &amp; Collard's (1999) and Goodman et al.'s (1998) proposals appear to be premature. Moreover, while the earliest hominins may be too finely split at the genus level, the evidence for distinction of Australopithecus and Paranthropus is solid.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fossil hominids.</field><field name="subject">Fossil hominids -- Carniology.</field><field name="subject">Paleoanthropology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eidolon: adapting distributed applications to their environment.</field><field name="creator">Potts, Daniel Paul, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Grids,  multi-clusters, NUMA  systems, and  ad-hoc collections  of distributed computing  devices  all  present  diverse environments  in  which  distributed computing applications can be run.   Due to the diversity of features provided by these environments  a distributed application that is  to perform well must be  specifically designed and  optimised for  the environment  in which  it is deployed.  Such optimisations generally affect the application's communication structure, its consistency protocols, and its communication protocols.  This  thesis  explores approaches  to  improving  the  ability of  distributed applications  to   share  consistent   data  efficiently  and   with  improved functionality over wide-area and diverse environments.  We identify a fundamental separation of concerns for distributed applications. This is used to propose a new  model, called the view model, which is a hybrid,  cost-conscious approach  to  remote data  sharing.   It provides  the necessary  mechanisms  and  interconnects   to  improve  the  flexibility  and functionality  of data  sharing  without defining  new  programming models  or protocols.  We employ the  view model to adapt distributed  applications to their run-time environment without modifying the  application or inventing new consistency or communication protocols. We explore the use of view  model properties on several programming models and their consistency  protocols.  In particular,  we focus on  programming models used in  distributed-shared-memory middleware  and applications, as  these can benefit significantly from the properties of the view model.  Our evaluation demonstrates the benefits, side effects and potential short-comings of the view model by comparing our model with traditional models when running distributed applications across several multi-clusters scenarios. In particular, we show that the view model improves the performance of distributed applications while reducing resource usage and communication overheads.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grids</field><field name="subject">Distributed computing</field><field name="subject">DSM</field><field name="subject">Distributed shared memory</field><field name="subject">MPI</field><field name="subject">View model</field><field name="subject">Distributed applications</field><field name="subject">Electronic data processing -- Distributed processing</field><field name="subject">Distributed operating systems (Computers)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of interference on GPS timing receivers and their impacts on communications networks.</field><field name="creator">Khan, Faisal, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The rapid evolution of current and upcoming high speed and complex communications networks often necessitates flawless time synchronization among the network nodes in order to guarantee performance. GPS based synchronizers have long been used for synchronizing telecommunications equipment, currently providing an accuracy of up to 10ns. Such high accuracy demands excellent operation from GPS timing receivers. Interference is an important threat to GPS performance. Any degradation in performance, due to the introduction of interference, can cause these receivers to provide a low quality timing solution, or to lose lock with incoming GPS signals altogether. This consideration motivates the study of the performance of GPS timing receivers in the presence of harmful interference. This work is devoted to the theoretical and practical investigations of the effects of RF interference on GPS-based synchronizers and their impacts on communications networks. Contributions made during this work include: a) Identification of the processes and the parameters involved in producing a timing solution which are vulnerable to interference; b) experimentbased confirmation of a hypothesis about the effects of interference on GPS timing receivers; c) identification of the effects of degraded synchronization on the performance of communications networks, especially CDMA and GSM cellular networks, which rely upon GPS based synchronizers; and d) proposal of a method to predict and avoid communications network performance degradation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS timing receiver.</field><field name="subject">Cellular network.</field><field name="subject">Synchronization.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dityrosine as a biomarker of free radical induced oxidative damage in diseases of ageing</field><field name="creator">Bucknall, Martin Paul, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">o,o???-Dityrosine (dityrosine), an oxidation product of tyrosine produced by reaction between tyrosyl radicals, is becoming established as a biomarker of free radical oxidative protein damage in vivo.  Attempts to measure dityrosine concentrations in various physiological and pathological systems have produced varied and often contradictory results.  Dityrosine concentrations in urine, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue varying over three orders of magnitude have been reported, together with inconsistent claims of significant dityrosine elevation in several ageing-related pathologies.  Some of these findings have contributed to the implication of free radical activity in the pathology of several neurodegenerative disorders, vascular and ocular abnormalities and in phagocyte response to infection.  The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that dityrosine levels are elevated in ageing and ageing-related disease.  The study also aims to determine the utility of dityrosine measurement as an index of oxidative damage, and elucidate possible explanations for the inconsistent levels reported.  An assay for the quantification of dityrosine was developed using capillary HPLC with electrospray tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).  The assay was highly specific for dityrosine and has the highest absolute sensitivity for dityrosine of any method reported to date, with a detection limit of 3 femtomoles of dityrosine on-column.  Urine samples from volunteers of different age and from hospital patients with various pathologies were analysed.  Plasma protein hydrolysates from control, Alzheimer???s and stroke subjects were analysed, together with hydrolysates of post mortem brain tissue from Alzheimer???s and control subjects.  Urinary dityrosine level is elevated in states of acute infection and inflammation, but does not correlate with age or chronic disease.  Protein dityrosine in four sections of Alzheimer???s brain was not significantly different from control sections.  Dityrosine was present in human plasma and tissue proteins at approximately 5-35 residues per million tyrosine residues, and in normal urine at 5-25 micromol/mol creatinine or 20-200 nM.  Most of the discrepancies in the literature relate to inadequate specificity of the analytical method.  Interpretation of published data with critical appraisal of measurement technology specificity is essential in developing an accurate understanding of the role of free radicals in ageing and disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tyrosine--Measurement</field><field name="subject">Free radicals (Chemistry)--Analysis</field><field name="subject">Active oxygen--Physiological effect.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of high-elaborative, emotion-rich reminiscing on children???s development of autobiographical memory and emotion knowledge.</field><field name="creator">Wareham, Penny, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">High elaborative parent-child reminiscing plays a significant role in preschoolers??? development of autobiographical memory, and, given the emotional salience of many past events, may also contribute to the development of emotion knowledge and other socio-cognitive skills. Additionally, whilst research has traditionally focused on reminiscing style, emotional content may also be important for child outcomes. In Study 1, a naturalistic paradigm was employed to examine associations of parents??? reminiscing style and emotion references with children???s emotion knowledge. Twenty-five parent-child dyads each discussed four emotionally salient past events. It was found that high elaborative parents more often discussed emotions causes than did other parents; in turn, a high elaborative style and discussion of emotion causes were each uniquely associated with children???s emotion knowledge. In Study 2 an experimental paradigm was used to examine the impact of emotion-oriented reminiscing on 88 children???s memory for a staged, emotion-rich event. Two days after participating in the event, children reminisced with an experimenter in one of four ways. Emotion-cause, emotion-expression, and no-emotion reminiscing were all high elaborative but differed in emotion content. Minimal reminiscing was low elaborative. Children who participated in emotion-cause reminiscing and, to a lesser extent, emotion-expression reminiscing, recalled significantly more emotional and non-emotional information about the event than did children who participated in no-emotion or minimal reminiscing. Study 3 aimed to extend the findings of Studies 1 and 2 by training mothers to reminisce using a high elaborative style and emotion content. 80 dyads initially participated; 44 completed all stages. After training, mothers and children in the reminiscing condition each used a more elaborative style and discussed emotions more than did their counterparts in a powerful ???child directed play??? control condition. These differences were sustained across six months, at which time children in the reminiscing condition also showed better emotion cause knowledge than did children in the control condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that children???s autobiographical memory and emotion knowledge may each develop via shared reminiscing interactions in the preschool years. In each case, the role of high-elaborative, emotion-rich reminiscing is highlighted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory.</field><field name="subject">Emotion.</field><field name="subject">Children.</field><field name="subject">Reminiscing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of intergovernmental collaboration in tourism among Asean nations.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Emma P. Y., Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">There often exists a skepticism regarding the feasibility and effectiveness of ASEAN tourism collaboration. The competitive nature of tourism, and the development gap between less-developed and developed member countries are some of the reasons ASEAN tourism is little more than a political gesture to the skeptics. In reality, the collaboration is slow-moving. Little is known about its mechanism let alone ways to improve it. Despite the continuous cooperative endeavor among the member nations since 1998 and the significant economic contribution tourism makes in the region, the ASEAN tourism phenomenon receives little attention from researchers. Hence, this research aims to answer two questions: (1) How do ASEAN countries collaborate in tourism? (2) What can be done to improve the collaboration? This research adopts a case study approach. It involves the formulation of theoretical propositions based on literature in political science and behavioral science. Primary data were collected from key stakeholders of ASEAN tourism by means of in-depth interviews. A total of twenty-one individuals participated. They represented nine out of the ten member governments, international organizations, industry associations, the academia, and consultancies. During the final stage of the research, congruence and discrepancies between the theoretical propositions and the empirical findings were identified, and a model of ASEAN tourism collaboration was constructed. One of the key findings is a recipe for success in intergovernmental tourism collaboration. It was found that three categories of factors facilitate ASEAN tourism collaboration and its implementation of policies: stakeholders ? especially the political will and commitment of national leaders; resources ? the technical and financial assistance provided by ASEAN dialogue partners; and cooperation management ? a flexible and ?conservative progressive? approach with a strong monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The contribution of this study is threefold. First, it fills an empirical gap by investigating a little yet known phenomenon that is politically and economically significant. Second, it contributes to theory development by extending the contextual boundaries of existing theories in intergovernmental collaboration. Finally, it provides directional and pragmatic policy recommendations on how to facilitate the collaborative process and on how to eliminate barriers to implementing the ASEAN Tourism Agreement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="subject">ASEAN</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances (Business)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary consequences of growth-from plasticity in a red seaweed.</field><field name="creator">Monro, Keyne, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Evolutionary processes in any population depend upon patterns of phenotypic variation available to selection and their underlying heritability. In this thesis, I used the filamentous red seaweed Asparagopsis armata, with particular focus on its modularity, to test several key questions underlying its growth-form evolution in  heterogeneous environments. I established that experimental manipulations of light quantity and quality mimicking variation in underwater light due to shading or depth induce growthform plasticity in A. armata that may be evolutionarily significant given its variability among clones. Current patterns of plasticity displayed by A. armata appear adaptive, moreover, given that a reciprocal transplant of phenotypes between light environments found densely-branched (phalanx-like) phenotypes to have higher relative growth rates than sparsely-branched (guerrilla-like) phenotypes in well-lit patches, but lower relative growth rates than the latter in shaded patches. Using the capacity for rapid growth as a proxy for fitness, multivariate selection analyses identified environment-dependent patterns of directional selection on single traits coupled with linear and nonlinear selection on multi-trait combinations that shape growth-form variation within patches of differing light intensity, thereby reinforcing plasticity across light environments. Quantitative genetic analyses, however, suggest that the modular iteration of genes in morphogenesis may limit further growth-form evolution in A. armata populations exposed to spatial heterogeneity in light by constraining thallus responses to environment-dependent selection. Last, heritable responses to artificial selection on growth-form variation among clonal cell-lineages revealed the surprising capacity for A.armata to circumvent genetic constraints inherent to its development by adapting to environmental change in the absence of sexually-generated variance among clones.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenotypic plasticity.</field><field name="subject">Red algae.</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zero return: Directions in sound and image.</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Nathan, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research project explores a direction in the formation of sound and image. In the creation of a series of 'moving paintings' I bring together pieces of moving image and sound using techniques derived from musique concr??te. I have coined the term 'moving painting'  to describe these sound/image objects that have grown out of an attention to the form, activity, rhythm and texture of sound and image. This project develops from an understanding that sound and image can be constructed on their own terms as opposed to being organised by specific plot devices. This text offers a context for the formation of these moving paintings and outlines the systems of construction that bring them forth from noise. Firstly, I identify sound and its emergence from noise. Secondly, I address the formation of sound into music within a community. And lastly, I use these ideas to form systems for organising visual imagery. In doing this, I present a series of audiovisual works in which sound and image are woven together to form moving paintings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multimedia (Art)</field><field name="subject">Avant-garde (Music)</field><field name="subject">Musique concrete.</field><field name="subject">Digital art.</field><field name="subject">Time and art.</field><field name="subject">Sound in art.</field><field name="subject">Art and music.</field><field name="subject">Art and electronics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New developments in the construction of lattice rules: applications of lattice rules to high-dimensional integration problems from mathematical finance.</field><field name="creator">Waterhouse, Benjamin James, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">There are many problems in mathematical finance which require the evaluation of a multivariate integral. Since these problems typically involve the discretisation of a continuous random variable, the dimension of the integrand can be in the thousands, tens of thousands or even more.  For such problems the Monte Carlo method has been a powerful and popular technique. This is largely related to the fact that the performance of the method is independent of the number of dimensions. Traditional quasi-Monte Carlo techniques are typically not independent of the dimension and as such have not been suitable for high-dimensional problems. However, recent work has developed new types of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets which can be used in practically limitless dimension. Among these types of point sets are Sobol' sequences, Faure sequences, Niederreiter-Xing sequences, digital nets and lattice rules. In this thesis, we will concentrate on results concerning lattice rules. The typical setting for analysis of these new quasi-Monte Carlo point sets is the worst-case error in a weighted function space. There has been much work on constructing point sets with small worst-case errors in the weighted Korobov and Sobolev spaces. However, many of the integrands which arise in the area of mathematical finance do not lie in either of these spaces. One common problem is that the integrands are unbounded on the boundaries of the unit cube. In this thesis we construct function spaces which admit such integrands and present algorithms to construct lattice rules where the worst-case error in this new function space is small.  Lattice rules differ from other quasi-Monte Carlo techniques in that the points can not be used sequentially. That is, the entire lattice is needed to keep the worst-case error small. It has been shown that there exist generating vectors for lattice rules which are good for many different numbers of points. This is a desirable property for a practitioner, as it allows them to keep increasing the number of points until some error criterion is met. In this thesis, we will develop fast algorithms to construct such generating vectors. Finally, we apply a similar technique to show how a particular type of generating vector known as the Korobov form can be made extensible in dimension.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lattice theory.</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo method.</field><field name="subject">Multiple integrals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodegradation, surface rugosities and biofilm coverage of biopolymers</field><field name="creator">Woolnough, Catherine Anne, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The increasing concern for sustainability and progress of medical research has resulted in the emergence of a wide range of biopolymers. The biodegradability of these alternative biopolymers requires investigation prior to their application in environmental and medical systems. This Thesis describes biodegradation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (P(HB-co-HV)), poly(3- hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO), poly-DL-lactide (PDLL), poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PDLLG) and ethyl cellulose (EC). Polymers were buried in garden soil for in vivo biodegradation experiments and a mixed population of microbes from the soil were incubated in laboratory in vitro biodegradation experiments. In both systems the short chain length PHA???s degraded rapidly and the medium chain length PHAs and other biomaterials displayed either slow or negligible weight loss. PHB and P(HB-co-HV) copolymers degraded to T50 6.7 to 9.7 times faster in vitro than in vivo. After 380 days burial in soil PHO had lost 60 % of the original 20 mg weight, PDLL 28 % and PDLLG 35 %. Ethyl cellulose and polystyrene did not biodegrade, Polymer-microbe surface interactions were investigated. The faster degrading polymers PHB and P(HB-co-HV) attracted a higher coverage of biofilm than the slower degrading polymers PHO, PDLL and PDLLG for both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. The non-degradable polymers (EC and polystyrene) attracted no biofilm. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated a positive correlation between biofilm coverage and polymer weight loss. Additionally the rougher air sides of solvent cast films attracted more biofilm than the smoother dish sides. Polymer surface changes were quantified with microscopy. Surface roughness of PHB, P(HB-co-8HV) and PHO increased during biodegradation, primarily due to an increase in the waviness component for both in vitro and in vivo degradation. In vitro methods provided a rapid mechanism for protocol development and sufficiently predicted both surface roughness changes and biofilm-biodegradation relationships in vivo. PHB and P(HB-co-8HV) were blended with the biodegradable antifouling agent 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (DCOI or Sea Nine 211). DCOI leached slowly from the films into the soil delaying biodegradation of the films until a lower residual level of DCOI remained. Biofouling was reduced on PHA films containing DCOI.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biopolymers -- Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Biopolymers -- Biodegradation</field><field name="subject">Biodegradation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagnostics, prognostics and fault simulation for rolling element bearings</field><field name="creator">Sawalhi, Nader, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vibration signals generated from spalled elements in rolling element bearings (REBs) are investigated in this thesis.  A novel signal-processing algorithm to diagnose localized faults in rolling element bearings has been developed and tested on a variety of signals. The algorithm is based on Spectral Kurtosis (SK), which has special qualities for detecting REBs faults. The algorithm includes three steps. It starts by pre-whitening the signal's power spectral density using an autoregressive (AR) model. The impulses, which are contained in the residual of the AR model, are then enhanced using the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) technique, which effectively deconvolves the effect of the transmission path and clarifies the impulses. Finally the output of the MED filter is decomposed using complex Morlet wavelets and the SK is calculated to select the best filter for the envelope analysis. Results show the superiority of the developed algorithm and its effectiveness in extracting fault features from the raw vibration signal.  The problem of modelling the vibration signals from a spalled bearing in a gearbox environment is discussed. This problem has been addressed through the incorporation of a time varying, non-linear stiffness bearing model into a previously developed gear model. It has the new capacity of modeling localized faults and extended faults in the different components of the bearing. The simulated signals were found to have the same basic characteristics as measured signals, and moreover were found to have a characteristic seen in the measured signals, and also referred to in the literature, of double pulses corresponding to entry into and exit from a localized fault, which could be made more evident by the MED technique. The simulation model is useful for producing typical fault signals from gearboxes to test new diagnostic algorithms, and also prognostic algorithms.  The thesis provides two main tools (SK algorithm and the gear bearing simulation model), which could be effectively employed to develop a successful prognostic model.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roller bearings.</field><field name="subject">Bearings (Machinery) -- Vibration -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Knowledge acquisition (Expert systems)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy-related CO2 emissions in the Indonesian manufacturing sector</field><field name="creator">Sitompul, Rislima Febriani, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is aimed at developing policies for energy efficiency by observing the past changes of energy use in Indonesia???s manufacturing sector over the period 1980???2000, and to investigate mitigation options for energy-related CO2 emissions in the sector. The first part of the study uses decomposition analysis to assess the effect of the changes in energy consumption and the level of CO2 emissions, while the second part investigates energy efficiency improvement strategies and the use of economic instruments to mitigate CO2 emissions in the manufacturing sector. Economic activity was the dominant factor in increasing energy consumption over the whole period of analysis, followed by the energy intensity effect and then the structural effect. The increase in aggregate energy intensity over the period 1980-2000 was mainly driven by the energy intensity effect. In turn, the technical effect was the dominant contributor to changes in energy intensity effect, with the fuel-mix effect being of lesser importance. Changes in CO2 emissions were dominated by economic activity and structural change. Sub-sectors that would benefit from fuel switching and energy efficiency improvements are the textile, paper, and non-metal sub-sectors. Three main options for reducing CO2 emissions from the manufacturing sector were considered: the imposition of a carbon tax, energy efficiency initiatives, and other mitigation measures. A carbon tax was found to reduce sectoral emissions from the direct use of oil, gas and coal, but increased the demand for electricity. At the practical level, energy efficiency improvements can be implemented by adopting energy efficient technologies that can reduce aggregate energy intensity up to 37.1 per cent from the base-year level, estimated after imposition of a carbon tax at $30 per tonne of carbon. A major priority for energy efficiency improvements was found to be in the textile and the paper and chemical sub-sectors. A mitigation measure such as the Clean Development Mechanisms could be encouraged in order to reduce projected emission levels. The preferred option would be the adoption of energy efficient technologies in the textile, chemical, paper and non-metal sub-sectors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy policy -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Energy consumption -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Atmosperic carbon dioxide -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Manufacturing industries -- Environmental aspects -- Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of recombinant proteins for selection, immobilization and expansion of stem cells</field><field name="creator">Xu, Yin, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cellulose binding domains (CBDs) are found in cellulolytic microorganisms as discrete domains in free cellulases or as cellulosomes, which are extracellular multi-enzyme complexes. CBDs bind to cellulose and help the catalytic domains to access cellulose substrates. CBDs are used as affinity tags for immobilizing cells, proteins or molecules on cellulose matrices. They can also be used in protein engineering to alter protein expression and solubilities. Cohesins and dockerins are domains exclusive to cellulosomes. They interact with high affinity and the interactions are Ca2+-dependent. Chelation of Ca2+ causes irreversible conformational change to dockerins thus disrupting the interactions. The first aim of this project was to validate a putative CBD from endoglucanase EngD of C. cellulovorans, to test its effect on solubility as a fusion in chimeras. The second aim was to use chimeric proteins containing CBD, cohesin, dockerin and LG to establish a system for efficient cell immobilization, expansion and harvest in hollow cellulose fibres. A putative CBD from an enzyme with its natural linker (PTCBDengD), a CBD from a scaffoldin (CBDcbpA), three cohesin domains from different strains (Cip7, Coh6 and CipC1) and an antibody binding protein (LG) were used to construct various chimeric and fusion proteins. The two CBDs were fused to different cohesins and LG respectively and the chimeras? solubility was analyzed. The results showed that fusing with CBDcbpA did not significantly help to increase the solubility of the insoluble domain Coh6 and it even greatly reduced the solubility of the soluble domain CipC1. In contrast, PTCBDengD fusion increased the solubility of Coh6 by three fold and it did not alter the solubility of soluble protein/ domains. These results suggested that PTCBDengD may be a better domain to use as a fusion tag for expression and other biotechnology applications. Cellulose binding specificity of PTCBDengD and its chimeric proteins were tested and SDS-PAGE analysis results clearly demonstrated that PTCBDengD and its chimeras specifically bound to crystalline cellulose Avicel and non-crystalline cellulose Cuprophan. The results confirmed that PTCBDengD is a true CBD. Chimeric protein pairs CBDcbpA-Cip7/ LG-Doc and Cip7-PTCBDengD/ LG-Doc were used to build the scaffold on Cuprophan hollow cellulose fibre for reversible cell immobilization studies. Cell adhesion assay results showed that the double-chimera systems efficiently immobilize cells onto Cuprophan hollow fibre. Dissociation of LG-Doc from amorphous cellulose Cuprophan-bound CBDcbpA-Cip7 by EDTA treatment resulted in decrease of cell binding by almost 90%; however, re-association of LG-Doc after EDTA dissociation only achieved 50% efficiency of cell immobilization. Dot blot and SDS-PAGE analysis showed that dissociation/ re-association of LG-Doc to Cip7-PTCBDengD could be decreased in was interfered by the presence of cellulose. Preliminary results indicated that crystalline cellulose Avicel may improve dissociation/ re-association efficiency.  In conclusion, studies on recombinant proteins validated CBDengD's specific affinity to cellulose and its solubilizing effect on its fusion partner. Chimera pairs CBDcbpA-Cip7/ LG-Doc and Cip7-PTCBDengD/ LG-Doc are effective in cell immobilization. However, optimization is required to develop recyclable protein scaffolding and complexes on cellulosic matrices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stem cells -- Research</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Biotechnology.</field><field name="subject">Cellulose.</field><field name="subject">Cellulose -- Microbiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic evaluation of body-related words and images</field><field name="creator">Watts, Kaaren Jane, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research examined automatic evaluation of body-related stimuli in female undergraduates using an affective priming task. Automaticity was tested by varying the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) and valence congruence of the prime and target pairs. The prime to target interval (SOA) was either short or long, and the valence of the paired items was either the same (congruent) or different (incongruent). Automaticity was indicated by faster responses to congruent pairs than to incongruent pairs at the short SOA (parsimonious criterion) but not at the long SOA (classic criterion). Individual differences in thin internalisation, appearance schematicity, body dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint were assessed as potential moderators. Automatic evaluation of body-related images, but not words, was demonstrated in Study 1B and Study 1A, respectively. In Study 2A, automatic evaluation of nonbody-related words was obtained and this was extended to body-related words (Study 2B). In Study 3, automatic evaluation of normatively-selected body words was examined and body image schema activation was tested as a function of level of appearance schematicity. There was a trend toward automaticity and schematicity did not moderate schema activation. Overall, elevated body image concerns did not influence automatic evaluation in Studies 1A to 3 (with the exception of Study 1B). The role of extreme levels of appearance schematicity on automaticity and schema activation was examined in Studies 4A and 4B for normative and idiographic primes. Automatic evaluation was demonstrated in Study 4A and a trend was obtained in Study 4B. Schematicity did not moderate affective processing or schema activation. Automatic evaluation of body-related images was replicated in Study 5 but it was not moderated by prime strength or individual differences. Overall, the research suggests that most female undergraduates, irrespective of differences in body image concerns, automatically evaluate body-related stimuli.

Based on 6900 known deaths, and 1455 known non-deaths, sensitivity and specificity of the linkage was estimated to be 82% and 92% respectively. Mortality rates were compared by calendar period, pre-ART (&lt;1990), pre- and early-HAART (1990-1996) and late-HAART (1997-2003). Mortality following AIDS decreased from 590.2/1000 person years pre-ART to 77.4 during the late-HAART period. Mortality following HIV diagnosis prior to AIDS increased from 9.7 to 20.2/1000 person years. The total number living with diagnosed HIV infection in Australia was estimated to have increased from 7873 at the end of 1989 to 12828 in 2003. Risk factors for survival following HIV and AIDS diagnosis were assessed using Cox regression. Age &gt;40 years and certain HIV exposure results were associated with poorer survival following HIV. Predictors of poorer survival following AIDS were age &gt;40 years, females exposed to HIV through receipt of blood, CD4 count &lt;20 and certain AIDS illnesses. Parametric models of survival following HIV and AIDS diagnosis were assessed using likelihood based criteria. Goodness of fit was assessed by comparing observed with model predicted numbers of deaths. Weibull models were found to fit best to both survival following HIV and AIDS. Parametric survival models were used to project deaths after HIV and AIDS across three scenarios of HAART usage. Deaths following HIV were projected to remain low, but to increase from 223 in 2005 to 288, 292 and 282  in 2010  if the HAART usage remains stable at 2005 levels, increases to 70% of all people with diagnosed HIV by 2010 and decreases to 39% of all people with diagnosed HIV respectively. Deaths after AIDS diagnosis were projected to increase unless if HAART usage increases to 100% of AIDS diagnoses by 2010.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Mortality -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of GPS, INS and pseudolite to geo-reference  surveying and mapping systems</field><field name="creator">Wang, Jianguo Jack, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite significant progress in GPS/INS integration-based direct geo-referencing (DGR) technology over the past decade, its performance still needs to be improved in terms of accuracy and tolerance to GPS outages. This is mainly due to the limited geometric strength of the GPS satellite constellation, the quality of INS and the system integration technology. This research is focused on pseudolite (PL) augmentation to enhance the geometric strength of the GPS satellite constellation, and the Neural Network (NN) aided Kalman filter (KF) system integration algorithm to improve the geo-referencing system's performance during GPS outages. The main research contributions are summarized as below:  a) Systematic errors introduced by pseudolites have been investigated. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that errors of troposphere delay modelling, differential nonlinearity and pseudolite location are sensitive to pseudolite receiver geometry. Their effect on final positioning solutions can be minimised by selecting optimal pseudolite and receiver locations, which is referred to as geometry design. Optimal geometry design for pseudolite augmented systems has been proposed based on simulation results in airborne surveying scenarios.  b) Nonlinear geometry bias, or nonlinearity, exists in single difference processes when the unit vectors from the reference and user receivers to a satellite or pseudolite are non-parallel. Similar to long baseline differential GPS (DGPS), nonlinearity is a serious issue in pseudolite augmentation. A Projected Single Difference (PSD) method has been introduced to eliminate nonlinear geometry bias. An optimized expression has been derived to calculate the direction of project vectors, and the advantages of applying PSD in pseudolite augmented airborne DGPS have been demonstrated.  c) A new method for pseudolite tropospheric delay modelling has been proposed, which is based on single-differenced GPS tropospheric delay models. The performance of different models has been investigated through simulations and field testing. The advantages and limitations of each method have been analysed. It is determined that the Bouska model performs relatively well in all ranges and elevations if the meteorological parameters in the models can be accurately collected.  d) An adaptive pseudolite tropospheric delay modelling method has been developed to reduce modelling error by estimating meteorological parameters in real-time, using GPS and pseudolite measurements. Test results show that pseudolite tropospheric delay modelling errors can be effectively mitigated by the proposed method.  e) A novel geo-referencing system based on GPS/PL/INS integration has been developed as an alternative to existing GPS/INS systems. With the inclusion of pseudolite signals to enhance availability and geometry strength of GPS signals, the continuity and precision of the GPS/INS system can be significantly improved. Flight trials have been conducted to evaluate the system performance for airborne mapping. The results show that the accuracy and reliability of the geo-referenced solution can be improved with the deployment of one or more pseudolites.  f) Two KF and NN hybrid methods have been proposed to improve geo-referenced results during GPS outages. As the KF prediction diverges without measurement update, the performance of a GPS/INS integrated system degrades rapidly during GPS outages. Neural networks can overcome this limitation of KF. The first method uses NN to map vehicle manoeuvres with KF measurement in a loosely coupled GPS/INS system. In the second method, an NN is trained to map INS measurements with selected KF error states in a tightly coupled GPS/INS system when GPS signals are available. These training results can be used to modify KF time updates. Optimal input/output and NN structure have been investigated. Field tests show that the proposed hybrid methods can dramatically improve geo-referenced solutions during GPS outages.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systems Integration.</field><field name="subject">GPS.</field><field name="subject">INS.</field><field name="subject">Pseudolite.</field><field name="subject">Geo-reference.</field><field name="subject">Global Positioning System.</field><field name="subject">Inertial navigation systems.</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in surveying.</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in navigation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acoustics of the steel string guitar</field><field name="creator">Inta, Ra Ata, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">To improve the replication of acoustic guitars, measurements of three Martin OOO style steel-string guitars were made at various stages of their construction. The guitars were constructed in parallel, as similar to each other as possible, with the exception of the soundboard material---which were made of Sitka spruce,  Engelmann spruce and Western Red cedar.  To improve the similarity of the instruments, methods were developed to measure and control the material properties of key components before their incorporation into the instruments, including a device to measure the thickness of a guitar soundboard attached to the back and sides of the instrument.  Some of these measurements were compared to numerical models of the instrument and, after the establishment of a lexicon to describe guitar sounds, some physical factors contributing towards the timbre of guitar sounds were determined. The results of these investigations may be developed to improve the consistency in the manufacture of stringed musical instruments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acoustics.</field><field name="subject">Guitar.</field><field name="subject">Vibration.</field><field name="subject">Steel-string.</field><field name="subject">Luthier.</field><field name="subject">Music.</field><field name="subject">Guitar -- Construction.</field><field name="subject">Guitar -- Acoustics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical and experimental studies of granular dynamics in IsaMill</field><field name="creator">Jayasundara, Chandana Tilak, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">IsaMill is a stirred type mill used in mineral industry for fine and ultra-fine grinding. The difficulty in obtaining the internal flow information in the mill by experimental techniques has prevented the development of the fundamental understanding of the flow and generating general methods for reliable scale-up and optimized design and control parameters. This difficulty can be effectively overcome by numerical simulation based on discrete element method (DEM). In this work a DEM model was developed to study particle flow in a simplified IsaMill. The DEM model was validated by comparing the simulated results of the flow pattern, mixing pattern and power draw with those measured from a same scale lab mill. Spatial distributions of microdynamic variables related to flow and force structure such as local porosity, particle interaction forces, collision velocity and collision frequency have been analyzed. Among the materials properties of particles, it is shown that by decreasing particle/particle sliding friction coefficient, the particle flow becomes more vigorous which is useful to grinding performance. Restitution coefficient does not affect the particle flow significantly. A too low or too high particle density could decrease grinding efficiency. Although grinding medium size affects the flow, its selection may depend on the particle size of the products. Among the operational variables considered, the results show that fill volume and mill speed proved to be important factors in IsaMil process. Increase of fill volume or mill speed increases the interaction between particles and agitating discs which results in a more vigorous motion of the particles. Among the mill properties, particle/stirrer sliding friction plays a major role in energy transfer from stirrer to particles. Although there exists a minimum collision energy as particle/stirrer sliding friction increases, large particle/stirrer sliding friction may improve grinding performance as it has both large collision frequency and collision energy. However, that improvement is only up to a critical particle/disc sliding friction beyond which only input energy increases with little improvement on collision frequency and collision energy. Reducing the distance between stirrers or increasing the size of disc holes improves high energy transfer from discs to particles, leading to high collision frequency and collision energy. Among the different stirrer types, the energy transfer is more effective when disc holes are present. Pin stirrer shows increased collision energy and collision frequency which also result in a high power draw. Using the DEM results, a wear model has been developed to predict the wear pattern of the discs. This model can be used to predict the evolution of the disc wear with the time. It is shown that energy transfer from discs to particles are increased when discs are worn out. An attempt has also been made to analyze the microdynamic properties of the mill for different sizes. It is shown that specific power consumption and impact energy are correlated regardless of the mill size and mill speed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DEM.</field><field name="subject">IsaMill.</field><field name="subject">Fine grinding.</field><field name="subject">Milling machinery.</field><field name="subject">Grinding machines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of seed drying using a two-stage drying concept</field><field name="creator">Jittanit, Weerachet, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effect of drying corn, rice and wheat seed in two stages was studied, using germinability as a measure of quality. For the first stage, fluidised bed dryer (FBD) and spouted bed dryer (SBD) were used to dry seed from 20-25%wb to 18%wb while in-store dryer (ISO) was used in the second stage for drying from 18%wb to below 14%wb. The drying air temperature range of 40-80??C was studied for the first stage while 18-30??C and relative humidity 60-70% were for the second stage. It was found that dryer type, drying temperature, initial moisture content of seeds and drying time had significant effects on the seed germination. From the result, the drying air temperature of 40??C was safe for corn and rice in FBD while 60??C was acceptable for wheat. In SBD, the 40??C was the maximum drying temperature for rice and wheat without quality deterioration. Meanwhile the second stage drying in an ISD under all specified conditions was safe.  In this work, the thin-layer drying models were developed. The results showed that the modified Page's model and modified two-compartment model were the best-fitted models with the root mean square (RMS) of the differences between the predicted moisture ratio and the measured values below 0.03. Besides, the existing ISD simulation program provided the RMS of 0.3, 1.1, and 0.9%wb for corn, rice and wheat respectively. The germination models for FBD and SBD were also developed. As a result, the modified Giner's models 1&amp;2 were the best-fitted models for FBD with the RMS of the differences between predicted and measured germination percentages of 7.9, 4.2 and 3.4% for corn, rice and wheat while the modified Giner's models 2&amp;3 were for SBD with the RMS of 5.5 and 6.1% for rice and wheat respectively.  The comparison between FBD and SBD revealed that FBD had faster drying rate while SBD consumed less energy. Ultimately, the energy cost analysis showed that single-stage drying in a fixed bed dryer using ambient condition consumed less energy than two-stage drying using a FBD and ISD but lower energy cost must be weighed against the faster drying rate, flexibility, portable design, and product uniformity of FBD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corn -- Seeds -- Drying.</field><field name="subject">Wheat -- Seeds -- Drying.</field><field name="subject">Rice -- Seeds -- Drying.</field><field name="subject">Seeds -- Drying -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Germination.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resistance, Regeneration and the Figuring of the 'New Jew': Ephraim Moses Lilien and 'Muscular Jewry'</field><field name="creator">Swarts, Lynne Michelle, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis embraces a cross-disciplinary approach to the examination of Jewish body culture, and integrates aspects of Jewish studies with new theories of gender and visual culture, thus contributing specifically to the field of Jewish body culture in relation to the visual arts. It demonstrates that at the fin de si??cle the Zionist artist, Ephraim Moses Lilien, integrated Nordau's concept of 'Muscular Jewry' and Buber's notion of a 'Jewish Cultural Renaissance' in order to figure the 'New Jew'. It establishes that Lilien's figuring of 'Muscular Jewry' as a visibly athletic, explicitly heterosexual, male body, bearing Jewish distinction, was developed as a crucial strategy to overcoming the twin dilemmas of Jewish alterity: antisemitism and assimilation. By proving that Lilien's art serves as a crucial model for both regenerating the Jewish male body and resisting antisemitic projections of decadence and degeneracy, this thesis expands upon current scholarship. It applies Margaret Olin's theory of ' visual redemption' to Lilien's figuring of the 'New Jew'  and Daniel Boyarin's articulation of Homi Bhaba's Post-Colonial theory of mimicry as imitation, inversion and resistance to determine how Lilien's images functioned as an art of resistance against the dominant Christian European culture. By demonstrating how Lilien drew upon the modern and rebellious Jugendstil to figure the 'New Jew' and produce a new, defiant and authentic Jewish visual culture, this thesis proves he transformed the image of the diaspora Jew into the New Hebrew or Israeli tsabar, forty years before it became part of Israeli identity. Nevertheless, this thesis also uncovers the double-binded predicament inherent to Lilien's quest; despite his attempt to use mimicry of the athleticised, hyper-masculine, genetically pure, normative body as a strategy to resist antisemitic rhetoric and invert its projection, the closest parallel to Lilien's figure of 'Muscular Jewry' remained this same image which became instrumental to eugenic campaigns across Europe, particularly in Nazi Germany. Ultimately what is exposed by this thesis is the illusion underpinning Lilien's figuring of the 'New Jew'; that the Christianised Eurocentric body culture, designed to eradicate decadence, degeneration and Semitism, could resolve the problematic struggle for a Jewish national identity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jews in art.</field><field name="subject">Jews -- Identity.</field><field name="subject">Art and religion.</field><field name="subject">Art and society.</field><field name="subject">Lilien, Ephraim Mose, 1874-1925.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implicit and explicit attitudes of health care workers and their injecting drug using clients with hepatitis C: is this related to treatment experiences?</field><field name="creator">Brener, Loren, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">People with hepatitis C (HCV) face stigma and discrimination because of the association of this disease with injecting drug use (IDU). Research has found that many instances of HCV-related discrimination occur in the health care sector. Health care workers' beliefs about their HCV positive clients are likely to influence how they relate to clients and their treatment delivery. This research assessed the implicit and explicit attitudes of both health care workers and their HCV positive injecting drug using (HCV+) clients toward each other and then established whether these affect the treatment experiences of health care workers and clients. The sample consisted of 60 health care workers (doctors and nurses), 120 HCV+ and 120 HCV- clients, recruited from the same treatment facility. Participants were given a series of attitude and treatment experiences measures to complete. Data illustrate that while health care workers' and HCV+ clients' explicit attitudes towards each other were positive, clients with HCV still rated their health care workers less highly and reported less satisfaction with their treatment than HCV- clients. Analyses also indicated that more conservative health care workers displayed greater prejudice toward their HCV+ clients because they believe that injecting drug use is controllable. This prejudice toward IDUs on the part of health care workers was associated with worry about the behaviour of IDU clients and this worry in turn predicted differences in treatment experiences reported by HCV+ and HCV- clients. These data support the contention that health care worker concerns, particularly those related to injecting drug use, underlie discriminatory treatment of people with HCV. Finally the research also addressed the impact of health care worker contact with HCV+ clients on their attitudes towards this group. Analysis revealed that while health care workers who have had more contact with people with HCV show more positive explicit attitudes, they also show less favourable implicit attitudes toward IDUs. This may reflect the difficulties and stresses associated in caring for IDUs and may provide insight into the hidden costs involved for health care workers working with a population that may be challenging and at times difficult to manage.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Patients.</field><field name="subject">epatitis C -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Physician and patient.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corneal hydration and the accuracy of Goldmann tonometry.</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Kirsten, School of Optometry &amp; vVsion Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the effect of corneal swelling on the accuracy of Goldmann tonometry estimates of intraocular pressure (IOP). In the first experiment, central corneal thickness (CCT, ultrasonic pachymetry), IOP (Goldmann tonometry) and corneal curvature (keratometry) was measured in one eye of 25 subjects every two hours for 24 hours, except for 8 hours overnight (no measurements taken), and for the first two hours after awakening (measurement frequency 20 minutes). CCT (+20.1??10.9 pm) and IOP (+3.1??2.4 mmHg) peaked on eye opening, and then decreased at a similar rate (r=0.967, p&lt;0.001) for the next two hours. Corneal swelling may have influenced the accuracy of Goldmann IOP measurements during this time. In the second and third studies, the CCT, IOP and corneal curvature were measured in both eyes of two groups of 25 subjects before and after the induction of corneal swelling, resulting from two hours of monocular closed eye contact lens wear. The increase in IOP was correlated to the increase in CCT at a rate of 0.33 to 0.48 mmHg per 10 pm, which signified an overestimation error in Goldmann IOP measurement. However, the change in IOP could not be accounted for solely by the change in CCT. In the fourth study, CCT, IOP and corneal curvature were used in conjunction with the Orssengo-Pye algorithm to determine the range of Young's modulus in the normal population, which was 0.29??0.06 MPa. Physiological variations in Young's modulus had a similar effect on Goldmann tonometry to CCT. In the fifth study, the data collected for studies 2 and 3 was used to calculate the Young's modulus changes associated with corneal swelling, again with the assistance of the Orssengo-Pye algorithm. No systematic change in Young's modulus was recorded after contact lens wear, but the model suggested that corneal biomechanical changes were responsible for the remainder of the change in IOP. All experimental results were combined to develop a model to calculate the diurnal variation of Goldmann IOP errors. The likely error in IOP due to overnight corneal swelling was 0.6 to 1.4 mmHg, which may explain as much as 45% (1.4 mmHg) of the 3.1 mmHg diurnal variation of IOP. In summary, small amounts of corneal swelling were shown to have a clinically significant impact on the accuracy of Goldmann tonometry. This may interfere with the measurement of the diurnal variation of IOP, particularly if measurements are taken prior to the resolution of overnight corneal swelling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cornea -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Tonometry</field><field name="subject">Intraocular pressure -- Measurement.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of PYY in regulating energy balance and glucose homeostasis</field><field name="creator">Boey, Dana, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Peptide YY (PYY) is a gut-derived hormone that is renowned for its effects on satiety. Reduced satiety in obese people has been attributed to low fasting and postprandial PYY levels. However, it has not been determined whether low PYY levels are the cause or the outcome of obesity. Moreover, the long-term role of PYY in regulating energy balance is unclear.  Results presented in this thesis, using PYY-deficient mice (PYY-/-) and PYY transgenic mice (PYYtg) highlight that PYY indeed has an important role in regulating energy balance and glucose homeostasis in vivo. PYY knockout mice became obese with ageing or high-fat feeding linked to a hyperinsulinemic phenotype associated with hypersecretion of insulin from isolated pancreatic islets. These findings suggested that PYY deficiency may be a predisposing factor for the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, PYYtg mice exhibited decreased adiposity and increased metabolism under high-fat feeding. Furthermore, PYYtg/ob mice had improved glucose tolerance and decreased adiposity. These latter studies suggested that high circulating PYY levels may protect against the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, both animal models support PYY as an important regulator of the somatotropic axis. These preliminary findings prompted investigations in understanding whether low PYY levels may be a predisposing factor for the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes in human subjects. In a population of healthy human subjects that had a predisposition to the development of type 2 diabetes and obesity, fasting PYY levels were lower than in normal subjects. Moreover, low fasting PYY levels strongly correlated with decreased insulin sensitivity and high levels of fasting insulin. Collectively, these findings suggest that low circulating levels of PYY could contribute to increased adiposity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Therefore determination of PYY levels may be a method of detecting whether people are predisposed to becoming obese and insulin resistant. This work also suggests that treatments that enhance circulating PYY levels may be protective in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peptides -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Obesity -- Animal models.</field><field name="subject">Non-insulin-dependent diabetes -- Animal models.</field><field name="subject">Neuropeptides.</field><field name="subject">Homeostatis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The triumphal arch motif in Sant'Andrea, Mantua: Respondeo and rhetoric in Alberti's architecture and theory</field><field name="creator">Carrer, Tomaso, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">Leon Battista Alberti's church of Sant' Andrea in Mantua has been closely studied by many Renaissance scholars in relation to its layout, dimensions, proportions, chronology, style and aesthetics, as well as earning its place in both Alberti's corpus and the sweep of Renaissance architecture. The thesis investigates how eloquence is embodied in the sequential repetition of the triumphal arch motif between inside and outside. This thesis it is based on extensive and critical review of historical and theoretical literature. It marks a close examination of Sant?Andrea and to lesser extent San Francesco in Rimini, revisiting key ideas, texts and words. The principal finding of the thesis is that Alberti?s concept of respondeo, as developed in De Re Aedificatoria is the key to understanding the triumphal arch motif and its repetition in the interior. The thesis also comprehensively outlines the variety of contexts in which repondeo can be understood. This term, correlated to the passing of time and to rhetorical-based Albertian terms as decorum and convenio, means a 'sensitive suitability' between parts.  The analysis of the triumphal arch motif of Sant?Andrea suggests that formalism has played a more important role in Alberti's design for this church than previously believed. This is by the motif's rigorous outline changing between the interior nave and the exterior fa??ade according to the observer's different visual perceptions. The rhetorical structure of the triumphal arch, in the way that it moves became from two to three dimensions in the fa??ade, seeks familiarity with the city's surrounding environment to establish simultaneity of actions. In this way, by joining the historical-religious point of references to a strategy of perception, the triumphal arch achieves public consensus. This rhetorical program is addressed especially by the patron of the church of Sant' Andrea Ludovico Gonzaga II also the ruler of Mantua with popular aspects of his public representations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architecture, Renaissance -- Italy.</field><field name="subject">Triumphal arches.</field><field name="subject">Alberti, Leon Battista, 1402-1472 -- De re aedificatoria.</field><field name="subject">San Sebastiano (Church : Mantua, Italy)</field><field name="subject">San Francesco (Rimini)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revisitation behaviour in a non-transactional website context</field><field name="creator">Maulana, Amalia Ernawaty, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines revisitation behaviour in the context of non-transactional websites. A holistic framework based on theories from repeat purchase behaviour and satisfaction was developed and tested. This study is among the first to consider revisitation as analogous to repeat purchase behaviour. The premise of the model is that revisitation is determined through an evaluation of prior visits and that the elements influencing revisitation included satisfaction, involvement (site, product category and medium) and social influences. Five non-transactional websites were examined with the selection based on the website typology developed in this thesis - a typology that will benefit website research as it provides a consistent and generic framework. Data were collected using a crosssectional web-based online survey via the homepage of the websites. Since satisfaction is considered to be a central factor in traditional repeat purchase behaviour and in website use, the antecedents of satisfaction were also examined. Overall the findings support the importance of content quality as a factor in satisfaction and even though website users are increasingly more proficient, ease of use is still an influential factor as is the attitude to the brand that the site supports. It was found that the users??? motives for using the site affected the relationship between the quality of the perceived benefits and satisfaction. If the motivation to use the site was for information, then the impact of information quality on satisfaction was weaker than the impact of entertainment quality on satisfaction. Alternatively, if the motivation was for entertainment, then once again the impact of information quality on satisfaction was weaker than that of entertainment quality. Initial model testing showed that the only factor to influence revisitation behaviour was enduring site involvement. Cognizant of the dangers of ???data driven theory???, the relationship of the elements was reassessed. The resultant model shows that product category involvement directly influences enduring site involvement and that enduring site involvement is a central construct operating as a direct and a mediating influence between each of satisfaction, social influence, medium involvement and website revisitation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet marketing</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Internet users</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self neglect and squalor among older people: the ethics of intervention</field><field name="creator">McDermott, Shannon Cumming, School of Social Science &amp; International Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">Self neglect among older people refers to situations in which older individuals fail to adequately maintain their environment and to perform essential self care tasks. This concept has been variably addressed in the fields of biomedicine, adult protection, and suicide prevention, yet minimal research has been conducted on this topic in Australia. While the existing literature acknowledges that these situations can pose considerable challenges for professionals, no research has explored the actual experience of these dilemmas in professional practice. This thesis aims to address these gaps by critically exploring how self neglect among older people is understood in the Australian context, investigating the content of ethical dilemmas that arise in these situations, and examining how professionals resolve these ethical dilemmas. A two-part, qualitative methodology was used to address the research aims. In Part One, a five-month period of participant observation was conducted at a community-based organisation that had obtained funding to provide case management to people living in squalor. In Part Two, 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals who worked with situations of squalor and self neglect in the community. The results from both parts of the research were analysed using NVivo, a software program specifically designed to assist in the analysis of qualitative data.  This research uncovered that, unlike the definition of self neglect used in the wider literature on this topic, participants clearly differentiated between personal neglect (self neglect) and environmental neglect (squalor and hoarding). Ethical dilemmas were common in these situations and fully understanding how professionals resolved these dilemmas required that both objective and relational approaches to ethics be used to analyse participant responses. In this way, a pluralistic approach to ethics emerged as the theory best suited to fully explore ethical decision-making in situations where older people were self neglecting or living in squalor. Decisions that resulted in good outcomes were found to be increasingly constrained by changes to services driven by neoliberalism and managerialism. Individual reflection and peer support emerged as important elements that helped professionals to cope with the ethical dilemmas and the practical constraints that were encountered in these situations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental illness.</field><field name="subject">Older people -- Mental health.</field><field name="subject">Community mental health services.</field><field name="subject">Decision making -- Moral and ethical aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of apoptosis and cell cycle to augment transfection efficiency in CHO cell lines .</field><field name="creator">Wanandy, Nico Stanislaus, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the biopharmaceutical industry, essentially, there are three components that play the main role in producing biopharmaceutical products, the host cell, the expression vector and the bioreactor and/or production environment. To produce the highly valued and desired products, the choice of a suitable host is one of the most important aspects. The host required is not only required to produce the desired product, but also needs to demonstrate robustness in a bioreactor system. Constantly facing challenges in a bioreactor, cells often undergo apoptosis, a well-known limiting factor in biopharmaceutical production, which ultimately leads to low yield of valuable protein(s).  We have genetically engineered a CHO-K1 cell line to constitutively express human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and murine polyoma large T-antigen (PyLT-Ag) to generate Super-CHO and CHO-T respectively, two cell lines that can potentially serve different niches in the biopharmaceutical industry. In the first part of the project, we hypothesised that suspension-adapted Super-CHO and CHO-T cells are both resilient cell lines relative to the suspension-adapted CHO-K1 (designated as CHO-XL-99) when facing nutrient depletion, one of the most common problems in a bioreactor.  Furthermore, in the second part of this project, the suspension-adapted CHO cell lines were also tested against a cytotoxic heavy metal, cadmium. Without the protection of the metal-resistance element, metallothionein, both Super-CHO and CHO-T cells were also challenged with cadmium to demonstrate their robustness over the parental cell line, CHO-XL-99. In the subsequent study, this project also focussed on the transfection efficiency of each parental and engineered CHO cell lines. Different strategies have been employed in the past in an attempt to improve productivity in the biopharmaceutical industry, from alterations in vector construction, improved culture condition, down to enhanced product recovery. However, the transfer and expression of the gene-of-interest (GOI) has still proven to be the limiting factor for achieving increased specific productivity. In an effort to improve transfection efficiency, strategies including cell cycle synchronisation and various transfection methods to deliver the GOI into the cells have been employed. Thus, the third part of this project has used synchronising agents in conjunction with commercially available lipid- and polymer-based reagents as delivery vehicle for the model protein, EGFP. The combination of cell synchronisation and transfection vehicle on transfection efficiency is studied here, in addition to their individual or collective effect on cell growth, apoptosis and viability. In summary, this project demonstrates the incidence of apoptosis in the cell culture induced by nutrient depletion and heavy metal, and that the use of transfection reagents solely, or in combination with synchronising agents also correlates with the increase of apoptotic indices in the cell culture. The use of the robust cell lines for transfection is an important aspect, and the balance between cell viability and the effort for augmenting transfection efficiency has to be met in order to achieve the maximum biopharmaceutical yields.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle.</field><field name="subject">Transfection.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geochemical signals in transported regolith in response to deeply buried Cu-Au mineralisation.</field><field name="creator">Mokhtari, Ahmad Reza, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transported regolith has the capacity to mask underlying mineralisation by restricting the migration of most trace elements to the surface. Oxidation of sulphides generates highly mobile H+ which may migrate to surface, resulting in alteration of minerals and redistribution of elements within transported regolith cover.  A detailed geochemical and geophysical study has been conducted at the Mandamah Cu-Au deposit in central-western New South Wales, where sub-economic mineralisation is covered by ~50 m of transported regolith and ~30 m of in situ regolith. A shallow-penetration electromagnetic survey was undertaken on nine transects and detailed mineralogical and selective extraction/ICP-MS geochemical analysis performed on regolith samples obtained from 107 soil cores and 16 pits spanning three extensive traverses across buried mineralisation. The selective extractions used were ammonium acetate, hydroxylamine.HCl and aqua regia.  A distinct vertical zonation exists in the upper two metres of the transported regolith cover across the site and is related to soil mineralogy, soil pH, electrical conductivity and the amount of selectively extractable elements using the different geochemical extractions. The upper zone of near-neutral soil pH contains organic material but little carbonate; the intermediate high-pH zone has up to 2% Mg-calcite; the underlying low-pH zone displays Fe mottling. This zonation results from precipitation of salts due to evaporation, changes in redox potentials and accumulation of organic materials, in an otherwise relatively homogeneous quartz-clay alluvium.  Ground conductivity measurements and selective extraction geochemistry display a strong response to parts of the underlying mineralisation. The principal signature is the depletion of Ca, S and Na, a reduction in the cation exchange capacity, the presence of non-carbonate alkalinity and a low electrical conductivity. A model to account for these patterns has been developed and involves a "prograde" stage of alteration of clay mineralogy and a redistribution of carbonates and various trace elements due to the development of an "acid chimney" above the oxidizing mineralisation during a period of elevated water tables and a "retrograde" stage involving a redistribution of some mobile elements back into the former acid chimney zone following the onset of more arid conditions. The results of this research demonstrate that the effects of sulphide mineralisation on the upper transported regolith at Mandamah can be detected using a combination of selective extraction geochemistry and shallow depth conductivity measurements. This technique has potential application in similar arid to semi-arid terrains.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regolith.</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the effects of hydrostatic pressureon rat retinal ganglion cell line RGC5.</field><field name="creator">Li, Shaojuan, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Glaucoma is characterized by retinal ganglion cell apoptosis leading to a corresponding loss of the visual field. Elevated intraocular pressure is the principal clinical association of this disease and its reduction remains the mainstay of current therapy. This research established an in-vitro glaucoma model and investigated the direct effects of increased hydrostatic pressure on retinal ganglion cell survival as well as the cellular response to changes in pressure. In the first part of this thesis (chapter 3) the direct effects of pressure on retinal ganglion cell survival was established. The differentiated RGC5 cell line was subjected to elevated pressure 100 mmHg for a period of two hours in a pressure chamber. Cell apoptosis was then detected by TdT-mediated dITP Nick-End Labelling (TUNEL). Quantitative analysis of the percentage of apoptotic cells between the control and pressure groups by Laser Scanning Cytometry (LSC) revealed that pressure alone induced significant apoptosis. Furthermore, caspase-3 cleavage was detected in the pressure treated cells by Western blot analysis. The next three chapters investigated how the applied pressure may be mediated through cellular mechno-sensitive structures. TWIK Related Arachiodonic Acid stimulated K+ channel (TRAAK) is a mechano-gated neuronal potassium channel, which can be opened by pressure and arachidonic acid. In chapter 4, TRAAK was identified as expressed on the rat RGC5 cell line. This was determined by both immunostaining and RT-PCR. Opening this channel by arachidonic acid induced significant apoptosis in RGC5 neurons; elevated extracellular K+ concentration and blockage of TRAAK by gadolinium inhibited both arachidonic acid and pressure-induced apoptosis. These results indicated that elevated pressure resulted in opening of the outward potassium channel-TRAAK and consequently potassium ion efflux and apoptotic volume decrease (AVD). Data from chapter 5      revealed that pressure also caused actin     reorganization with both F- and G-actin shifts. At the early stage (following 2 hours pressure treatment), actin polymerization led to G-actin pool decrease and disinhibition of DNase1 in the cytoplasm. This has been suggested to lead to DNase1 nuclear translocation and contribution to DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis. The preliminary microarray results of chapter 6 revealed pressure effects on gene expression Included in the many up- and down-regulated genes was; down-regulation of antiapoptotic gene- BcL-x and up- regulation of Damage-Induced Neuronal Endopeptidase (DINE) after pressure treatment. This study showed that elevated pressure induced RGC5 apoptosis and affected multi cellular mechanosnesitive structures. These results may indicate new mechanisms of RGC neuron apoptosis and further therapeutic strategies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrostatic pressure</field><field name="subject">Retinal ganglion cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post???deposition processing of polycrystalline silicon thin???film solar cells on low???temperature glass superstrates</field><field name="creator">Terry, Mason L, Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) thin-film solar cells, defect passivation is critical to device performance. Isoelectronic or covalently bonded impurities, hydrogenic, extended defects and defects with localized levels in the bandgap (deep level defects) are typically introduced during the fabrication of, and/or are inherent to, pc-Si thin-film solar cells. These defects dramatically affect minority carrier lifetimes. Removing and/or passivating these defects is required to maximize minority carrier lifetimes and is typically done through thermal annealing and passivation techniques. For pc-Si thin-film solar cells on low temperature glass superstrates, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) and hydrogen plasma passivation (hydrogenation) are powerful techniques to achieve effective removal and passivation of these defects.  In this thesis, three silicon thin-film solar cells structures on low-temperature glass are subjected to variations in RTA high-temperature plateaus, RTA plateau times, and hydrogen plasma passivation parameters. These solar cells are referred to as ALICIA, EVA and PLASMA. By varying the RTA plateau temperature and time at plateau, the trade-off between extensive dopant diffusion and maximum defect removal is optimized. To reduce the density of point defects and to electrically activate the majority of dopants, an RTA process is shown to be essential. For all three of the thin-film solar cell structures investigated in this thesis, a shorter, higher-temperature RTA process provides the best open-circuit voltage (Voc). Extensive RTA plateau times cause excessive dopant smearing, increasing n = 2 recombination and shunt resistance losses.  Hydrogenation is shown to be an essential step to achieve maximum device performance by `healing' the defects inherent to pc-Si thin-film solar cells. If the hydrogen concentration is about 1-2 times the density of oxygen in the cells as measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), the cells seem to respond best to hydrogenation, with good resultant Voc and short-circuit for all cells investigated in this thesis. The effect of hydrogen passivation on the Voc is spectacular, typically increasing it by a factor of 2 to 3.5. Hydrogen de-bonding from repeated thermal treatments at increasing temperature provides a deeper understanding of what defects exist and the nature of the defects that limit the cell voltage.  The variation in RTA and hydrogenation process parameters produces significant empirical insight into the effectiveness of RTA processes for point defect removal, dopant activation, point defect and grain boundary passivation, and impurity passivation. SIMS measurements are used to determine the impurities present in the cells' bulk and the amount of hydrogen available to passivate defects. From the results presented it appears that pc-Si thin-film solar cells on low-temperature glass are a promising, and potentially lower-cost, alternative to Si wafer based cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin film.</field><field name="subject">Silicon.</field><field name="subject">Solar cells.</field><field name="subject">Rapid thermal.</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen passivation.</field><field name="subject">Hydrogenation.</field><field name="subject">Glass.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of heterocyclic dimers derived from isoflavones and flavones.</field><field name="creator">Deodhar, Mandar, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this project was to synthesize new heterocyclic dimers of isoflavones and flavones, and investigate various methodologies for their synthesis. The secondary aim of the project was to synthesize some flavonoid natural products. Dimeric systems were synthesized using various methodologies including acid catalyzed arylation of isoflavanols and flavanols, acid catalyzed dimerization of flavenes, oxidative dimerization, Sonogashira coupling, Ullmann coupling and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions. The acid catalyzed arylation of isoflavanols was found to proceed in a very stereoselective fashion to give trans-4-arylisoflavans in good yield in a single step. However, related flavanols under similar conditions gave mixtures of cis and trans isomers of 4-arylflavans. Interestingly, it was found that appropriately substituted flavenes, upon treatment with acid undergo stereoselective rearrangement and dimerization to give benzopyranobenzopyrans in high yields. A rationale for the rearrangement is proposed and this dimerization was used for the stereoselective synthesis of the natural product dependensin. As part of the project, some polycyclic natural products such as octandrenolone, flemiculosin, 3-deoxy-MS-II and laxichalcone were also synthesized.  Oxidative dimerization of activated isoflavones was found to be very regioselective, and novel isoflavone dimeric systems were synthesized. Related flavones however, failed to undergo dimerization under similar conditions. A probable explanation for high regioselectivity in the case of isoflavones and unreactivity of flavones has been presented. Phenol oxidative coupling was used for the one-step synthesis of another natural product kudzuisoflavone-A from daidzein. Sonogashira coupling was utilized for the synthesis of dimeric systems linked via an acetylic linker. A variety of soflavone isoflavone, flavone-flavone and isoflavone-flavone dimers were synthesized in "one-pot" by this methodology and in excellent yields. Although Ullmann coupling was found not to be suitable for the synthesis of isoflavone or flavone dimers, one-pot Suzuki-Miyaura methodology gave flavone dimers and various other heterocyclic dimers in good yields.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds -- Synthesis.</field><field name="subject">Dimers.</field><field name="subject">Flavonoids -- Synthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution equations and vector-valued Lp spaces: Strichartz estimates and symmetric diffusion semigroups.</field><field name="creator">Taggart, Robert James, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The results of this thesis are motivated by the investigation of abstract Cauchy problems. Our primary contribution is encapsulated in two new theorems.  The first main theorem is a generalisation of a result of E. M. Stein. In particular, we show that every symmetric diffusion semigroup acting on a complex-valued Lebesgue space has a tensor product extension to a UMD-valued Lebesgue space that can be continued analytically to sectors of the complex plane. Moreover, this analytic continuation exhibits pointwise convergence almost everywhere. Both conclusions hold provided that the UMD space satisfies a geometric condition that is weak enough to include many classical spaces. The theorem is proved by showing that every symmetric diffusion semigroup is dominated by a positive symmetric diffusion semigoup. This allows us to obtain (a) the existence of the semigroup's tensor extension, (b) a vector-valued version of the Hopf--Dunford--Schwartz ergodic theorem and (c) an holomorphic functional calculus for the extension's generator. The ergodic theorem is used to prove a vector-valued version of a maximal theorem by Stein, which, when combined with the functional calculus, proves the pointwise convergence theorem.  The second part of the thesis proves the existence of abstract Strichartz estimates for any evolution family of operators that satisfies an abstract energy and dispersive estimate. Some of these Strichartz estimates were already announced, without proof, by M. Keel and T. Tao. Those estimates which are not included in their result are new, and are an abstract extension of inhomogeneous estimates recently obtained by D. Foschi. When applied to physical problems, our abstract estimates give new inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates for the wave equation, extend the range of inhomogeneous estimates obtained by M. Nakamura and T. Ozawa for a class of Klein--Gordon equations, and recover the inhomogeneous estimates for the Schr??dinger equation obtained independently by Foschi and M. Vilela. These abstract estimates are applicable to a range of other problems, such as the Schr??dinger equation with a certain class of potentials.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strichartz estimates</field><field name="subject">Symmetric diffusion semigroups</field><field name="subject">Mathematical analysis</field><field name="subject">Evolution equations</field><field name="subject">Vector valued functions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The troubled surface of architecture: John Ruskin, the human body, and external walls.</field><field name="creator">Chatterjee, Anuradha, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">The meaning of the architectural surface was thoroughly reconsidered by architects and historians in England and Europe between early and mid-nineteenth century. There were two major trends. The first one was historicist. Ornament and colour was considered important because it represented the origins of architecture. The second approach was rational and tectonic. It suggested that an honest surface had to be created by emphasizing the structure and by truthfully expressing materials. An unusual response to these debates was John Ruskin??s history of medieval and Renaissance architecture. This was published as The seven lamps of architecture (1849), and the three volume study, The stones of Venice (1851-1853). Ruskin??s writings were difficult to grasp. On the one hand, they were fragmented, historically inaccurate, and lacking in explanatory power. On the other hand, they emphasized surface ornament, without ever indicating its architectural ??use??. As a result, nineteenth and twentieth century historians and architects declared Ruskin??s writings as being irrelevant to architectural theory and practice. By examining Ruskin??s writings on architecture through the theoretical lens of dress, body, and gender, the thesis demonstrates that he proposed the theory of the adorned ??wall veil??.This was a two-part theory. Firstly, architecture was defined by the presence of planar walls. The masonry structure of these walls was masked and decorated by a seamless dress-like surface, consisting of relief and polychromatic ornaments. Secondly, Ruskin distinguished between the ideal and the corrupt dress. The ideal dress celebrated the spiritual aspects of the body (surface, skin, and colour). The corrupt dress represented the scientific image of the body (depth, bones and muscles, and form). The ideal dress was reflected by the surfaces of medieval buildings, and the corrupt dress was mirrored by the Renaissance architectural surface. Through these arguments, the thesis makes two major contributions. Firstly, it shows that Ruskin??s views were consistent with the architectural modernism of the twentieth century, in which the free fa??ade and the atectonic surface were key concerns. Secondly, it establishes that Gottfried Semper??s writings were not the sole origin of the debates on dress and architecture. It shows that Ruskin developed a critical theory of dress by synthesizing debates on gender, science, and spirituality. He used this theory to suggest a new approach towards architecture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architecture -- Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Decoration and ornament, Architectural</field><field name="subject">Architectural design -- History</field><field name="subject">Building materials -- Surfaces</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual harassment: Perceptions, measures and laws in Thailand.</field><field name="creator">Soonthornpasuch, Pongprad, School of Politics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of perceptions of sexual harassment in Thailand, together with policies and measures against the practice. My main research questions are: How do Thai people perceive sexual harassment? And what can be done to combat and address sexual harassment in Thailand? My research also provides  recommendations for measures against sexual harassment in Thailand. The Thai term &amp;quot kan kukkam tang phet &amp;quot is used to convey ???sexual harassment??? in this study. The participants in my study understand kan kukkam tang phet as a broad term covering sexual behaviors that range from verbal harassment to rape. In general, the participants consider that sexual harassment is a big problem in Thailand. However, my research found that there are some perceptions and attitudes of Thai people that need to be dealt with as obstructions of measures against sexual harassment, such as blaming women as a cause of sexual harassment, anti-women prejudices, and the use of the excuse of cultural differences in implementing anti-sexual harassment laws. In regard to the question of legislation addressing sexual harassment in Thailand and what can be done to help to counter it, my findings are that Thailand has no clear approach to sexual harassment; no clear legal definition of sexual harassment; no specific authority or organization at the national level to redress sexual harassment; and no statistics on sexual harassment by national surveys. The promotion of awareness of sexual harassment has not yet been the subject of formal campaigns. My thesis presents recommendations to address sexual harassment in Thailand, through both legal measures and social measures. The legal measures proposed are sexual harassment law, a code of practice, and revision of the Penal Code. I suggest that sexual harassment law should be based on an ???anti-discrimination??? approach, to be consistent with the obligations of Thailand to implement suitable measures to give effect to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Social measures including education, campaigns and surveys on sexual harassment in the Thai community are also recommended in terms of raising the understanding of the concept and awareness of the issue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexual harassment -- Thailand.</field><field name="subject">Sexual harassment -- Law and legislation -- Thailand.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing coke gasification with carbon dioxide.</field><field name="creator">Grigore, Mihaela, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Of all coke properties the influence of the catalytic mineral matter on reactivity of metallurgical cokes is least understood. There is limited information about the form of minerals in the metallurgical cokes and no information about their relative concentration. A comprehensive study was undertaken for characterisation of mineral matter in coke (qualitative and quantitative), which enabled quantification of the effect of catalytic minerals on the reaction rate, and establishment of the effect of gasification on the mineral phases. Also, the relative importance of coke properties on the gasification reaction rate was determined. The reactivity experiments were performed at approximately 900??C using 100% CO2 under chemically controlled conditions. The mineralogical composition of the investigated cokes was found to vary greatly as did the levels of catalytic mineral phases. These were identified to be metallic iron, iron sulfides and iron oxides. The gasification reaction rate at the initial stages was strongly influenced by the content of catalytic mineral phases and also by the particle size of the catalytic mineral matter. The reaction rate increased as the contact surface between catalyst and carbon matrix increased.  Catalytic mineral phases showed a strong influence on the reaction rate at early stages of reaction. But their influence diminished during gasification. At later stages of reaction the influence of micropore surface area became more important.  The influence of the catalytic mineral phases diminished during gasification because the catalyst was inactivated to some degree and the contact surface between the catalyst and carbon matrix diminished due to the strong gasification of the carbon around the catalyst particles. The partial inactivation of the catalytic mineral phases occurred because metallic iron and pyrrhotite were oxidised by CO2 to iron oxide, and in turn iron oxide reacted with other mineral phases, which it is associated with, to form minerals that are not catalysts. It is noteworthy that a significant percentage of the mineral matter present in the investigated cokes was amorphous (44 - 75%). The iron, potassium and sodium present in the amorphous phase did not appear to catalyse gasification, but their potential contribution to gasification could not be completely excluded.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metallurgical coke.</field><field name="subject">Coke -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Coal gasification.</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalization as an entrepreneurial process.</field><field name="creator">Chandra, Yanto, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the substantial amount of work undertaken on internationalization to-date, most has placed little emphasis on the temporal processes and dynamics of internationalization in shaping firm internationalization histories. This is reflected in several problem areas in theories and research regarding internationalization including accelerated internationalization, full and partial de-internationalization and use of multiple modes of entry at a point in time. This study addressed an important question: what factors and processes affect the way a firm???s pattern of internationalization changes over time?  Although mainstream theories of internationalization and recent advances that link internationalization and entrepreneurship assume the importance of ???opportunity???, there is a paucity of research that that places ???opportunity??? as the core process in internationalization. By embracing time as a key dimension, this study reconceptualized internationalization as an entrepreneurial process: as the process of opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation in international markets. The research was undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 included a literature review covering the internationalization and entrepreneurship research streams. The discovery-evaluation-exploitation framework from entrepreneurship was used to identify relevant factors and explore eight case studies. By drawing on results from the exploratory research, an initial conceptual model and a set of propositions were developed. In Phase 2, fifteen case studies were theoretically sampled from a pool of small and medium enterprises from the knowledge and non-knowledge based industries in Australia. The data collection and analysis followed a process, event-driven approach to case study research involving the mapping of key sequences of events as well as within and cross case analysis.  The results clarified the nature and pattern of opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation, and a number of factors that influence this process: the role of prior knowledge, network ties, serendipity, absorptive capacity, bricolage, the nature of uncertainty, feedback mechanisms and effectual versus causal reasoning. The findings also suggest the evolutionary process of firm development and internationalization and show that born globals may be a classification error. The results indicate that full and partial de-internationalization as well as the use of multiple modes of entry are influenced by the interconnectedness of opportunities across the founding, domestic and international context over time; the role of Knightian uncertainty which can push or pull the patterns in many directions and how firms rely on effectual reasoning. The results provide a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of internationalization. The academic contributions of this thesis include the extension of Jones and Coviello???s (2005) model and previous models by developing a dynamic, process model of internationalization that is capable of addressing the temporal and dynamic gaps in internationalization; the integration and reconciliation of extant theories of internationalization by understanding the role of mode of reasoning; and the establishment of ???opportunity-firm??? nexus as a suitable unit of analysis in internationalization and international entrepreneurship research. Finally, the managerial contributions include guidance for firms and entrepreneurs in terms of dealing with uncertainty and complexity in international markets using the appropriate mode of reasoning (i.e. effectual, non-predictive approach vs. causal, predictive approach) in the right context and circumstances.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internationalization.</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship.</field><field name="subject">Globalization -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship -- Australia -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogeochemical dynamics of an intermittently open estuary: a field and modelling study.</field><field name="creator">Everett, Jason D., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science., UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a combined modelling and observational study of an intermittently open and closed lake or lagoon (ICOLL) in south-eastern Australia. ICOLLs are a common, yet vulnerable type of estuary characterised by low freshwater inflow leading to a sand berm being formed across the entrance preventing oceanic flushing. The accumulation of nutrients during the closed phase, and the increased water residence time, can have detrimental effects on the estuary if the nutrient load cannot be assimilated. The general aim of this study was to develop a quantitative understanding of ecological processes in Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes or Lagoons (ICOLLs) through a combination of field work and ecological modelling. The field-based component of the studied was completed in Smiths Lake, NSW Australia. The field data shows that concentrations of NH3, NOx and Chlorophyll a in Smiths Lake gradually increases over time between the two studied opening events, before declining while the lake is open to the ocean. Phosphorus concentration is relatively low throughout both cycles. Of the 2 opening events, one was long (~ 3.5 months) and one was short (~3 weeks). Initially ammonia concentrations following this short open period were 2-4 times higher than the initial values from the previous 2 closures. The reduced open phase also resulted in more persistent stratification. The observations show that the duration of the open/closed phases will influence the physiochemical characteristics of the water column. A spatially resolved, eleven-box ecological model was developed for Smiths Lake. The process descriptions in the ecological model are based on a combination of physical and physiological limits to the processes of nutrient uptake, light capture by phytoplankton and predator/prey interactions. An inverse model is used to calculate mixing coefficients from salinity observations. When compared to field data, the ecological model obtains fits for salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a and zooplankton that are within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean of the field data. Simulations show that nutrient limitation (nitrogen and phosphorus) is the dominant factor limiting growth of the autotrophs during both the open and closed phases of the lake. The model is characterised by strong oscillations in  phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance,typical of predator-prey cycles. A sensitivity analysis was completed using a simplified 1-box configuration, coupled with the existing ecological model. When small perturbations in the initial conditions of DIN, phytoplankton and zooplankton are implemented, the standard deviations of the state variables strongly attract to a declining oscillation, showing the variation between runs decreasing with time. The most sensitive parameters in the model were the feeding efficiency of small and large zooplankton, and the mortality of epiphytes and small zooplankton which all had normalised sensitivities of 1.28, 1.11, 1.01 and 1.05 respectively for a 10% change in parameter value. The non-linearity of the model is illustrated by increasing the percentage change of the parameter. For a 25% change in feeding efficiency of small and large zooplankton, the normalised sensitivity increased to 1.28 and 1.15 respectively, and for a 50% change, they increased further to 1.78 and 1.35 respectively. The ecological state variables were also sensitive to increased catchment loads and depths. The modelled system switches from seagrass dominated to algal dominated at loads over 10?? the current loads, with increased plankton biomass and suspended solids shading the seagrass. The spatially resolved ecological model is run for a variety of open/closed cycles to assess the impact of various opening regimes on the model state variables. The results indicate that Smiths Lake is capable of assimilating its current nutrient loads without persistent phytoplankton blooms or a decrease in seagrass biomass. When catchment loads are increased by 10?? or the duration of the lake open/closed cycle is increased there is a corresponding increase in seagrass biomass. In contrast, small and large phytoplankton both increase in biomass as the duration of the open phase increases. Small and large phytoplankton growth is generally limited by phosphorus, and seagrass growth is limited by nitrogen under normal catchment loads. Due to the shallow depths and low phytoplankton biomass, seagrass only becomes light limited when the nutrient and suspended solids loads are increased 10??. This switch to light limitation only decreases the biomass for short periods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuarine ecology.</field><field name="subject">Lakes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of Russian piano pedagogy on Vietnamese pianists, with comparisons of effects of Vietnamese piano pedagogy and UK piano pedagogy.</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Minh Thanh, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cultures in contact over a considerable period influence intellectual traditions, practices and habits relating to musical expression and the manner of teaching it. This study investigates the effects of different cultural contacts on Vietnamese student pianists, especially from Russian-style piano pedagogy and associated educational ideas and methods in music conservatoires. The purpose of this study was to compare various teaching approaches and learning styles, and the reactions of Vietnamese students to three different sources of training of piano teachers: Russia, Vietnam and England. Different sources of training affected piano pedagogy, and different musical traditions affected expression in piano performance, especially where students are from a cultural background different from that of their teacher. Observations of actual piano lessons were undertaken, and data were also obtained from interviews and questionnaires and analysed statistically. Results are reported and discussed in relation to four prominent features of the Russian piano school: achieving a powerful and substantial sound; the requirement for ???singing??? quality on the piano; the solid technical training which requires an enormous amount of practice time; and the necessity to play from memory. These are four prominent features of the Russian piano schooling. In addition, Vietnamese students??? problems regarding rhythmic accuracy highlight an inherent difference between the Vietnamese and Russian piano school. Major differences and similarities in teaching styles between Russian teachers and those from the UK and Vietnam were described and commented on under the following headings: use of mental practice; the role of listening; teacher demonstration; freedom for students in learning and making decisions (choice of repertoire; performance opportunities for students; students??? emotional reactions); the more liberal approach of the UK teachers; and the piano teaching styles at the Hanoi Conservatory that have been strongly influenced by the Russian piano school through Russian graduates??? teaching in Vietnam. These findings have important pedagogical implications. The more teachers control there was in lessons, the less a student would contribute to lessons actively. More liberal or less authoritarian approaches to teaching do not necessarily inculcate the discipline required for high achievement technically and expressively. There needs to be a balance between liberal approaches and encouraging the student to become autonomous in their efforts, and ensuring that they realize the importance of being disciplined in their practice habits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origin and detection of bacterial species associated with lettuce and salad vegetables.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Peter James, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ready-to-eat vegetable salads containing lettuce as a main ingredient have become popular food items in recent years. Microorganisms associated with these products determine their shelf-life, sensory appeal and safety. This thesis investigates the bacterial ecology of lettuce, aspects of their pre-harvest contamination with microorganisms, and the presence of antimicrobial constituents in such produce. Commercial pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides), used during lettuce cultivation were examined as potential sources of microbial contaminants. None of the pesticide concentrates contained viable microorganisms. After reconstitution in water, two of the pesticides supported growth of inoculated species of Pseudomonas, Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Pesticides reconstituted in agricultural waters (bore, dam and river) supported the growth of microorganisms (e.g. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas spp. and coliforms) naturally present in these waters. Unless properly managed, pesticide application could contribute microbial contaminants to vegetable produce, thereby affecting their quality.  Bacterial species associated with retail samples of lettuce were examined by plate culture on Tryptone Soy Agar and PCR-DGGE analysis. Macerates and rinses of lettuce sub-samples with and without addition of Tween 80 were examined to maximize bacterial recoveries. Predominant bacteria isolated by agar culture included species of Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Curtobacterium and Burkholderia, at populations of 103-106 cfu/g. PCR-DGGE was unable to recover the same incidence of species as agar culture and failed to detect bacteria in many samples. In some samples, PCR-DGGE detected species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Serratia and Acinetobacter, not found by culture. Failure of the PCR-DGGE analyses was attributed to interference by plant chloroplast DNA. Preparative agarose gel electrophoresis of lettuce macerates was necessary to remove chloroplast DNA before application of PCR-DGGE analysis. Thirty percent of lettuce samples contained Acinetobacter species at 101-104 cfu/g when examined after culture on minimal salts agar or enrichment in Baumann enrichment medium.

This thesis defines 'multimedia theatre' in two ways: firstly to include performance where media technologies are brought into the theatrical frame as a feature of the mise en scene, and secondly to refer to the area of new media performance, where a live performer may not be present but a high degree of performativity and liveness are achieved. Discourse in the field of digital aesthetics and new media theory is applied to examples and case studies of contemporary multimedia theatre practice to highlight the formal structures and modes of audience engagement operating within such work. Multimedia theatre may be characterised by the qualities of intermediality, immersion, interactivity, and postnarratvity, and these characteristics are used in this thesis as focal points to structure analysis and investigation.  The thesis also argues that recent developments in the field of multimedia theatre and performance may be viewed as related to a larger cultural shift predicated on the dissolution of the separation of the real and the virtual. It is further argued that multimedia theatre is acting as a forum for the exploration of the contemporary human experience, an experience shaped by the ubiquity of digital media and the development of a 'posthuman' perspective.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multimedia (Art)</field><field name="subject">Digital art.</field><field name="subject">Aethestics.</field><field name="subject">Virtual reality in art.</field><field name="subject">Performance art.</field><field name="subject">Theater -- Technological innovations.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic and optical characterisations of silicon quantum dots and its applications in solar cells</field><field name="creator">Fangsuwannarak, Thipwan, Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the structural, optical and electrical properties of crystalline silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) are examined for application to silicon based tandem cells. The approach has been to concentrate on all silicon devices by taking advantage of quantum confinement in low-dimensional Si. RF magnetron co-sputtering provided the capability of creating superlattice structures in conjunction with high temperature annealing, to form Si nanocrystals in an oxide matrix. Structural techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), micro-Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIM) were employed to gather structural information about the SiQD/SiO2 SLs. The result combine presents that the packing density of Si QDs, correlated to the oxygen content of the silicon rich oxide layer can be control independently.  The effect of Si nanocrystallite density on Raman scattering is investigated. The preliminary results present that a decrease in the oxygen content (x) results in an increased sharpness of the Strokes-mode peak of nanocrystalline Si, attributed to an increase in the proportion of crystalline Si because of the increased number of SiQDs. However the influence of the surface region on the crystallite core intensity scattering becomes dominant, when SiQD size diameter is very small (less than 3 nm). The present work shows that a decrease in x-content leading to an increase of the SiQD concentration, initially results in the enhancement of the lateral conductivity in the SiQD superlattice material.  In this work, the Al contacting scheme, using a prolonged heat treatment technique at elevated temperature less than the eutectic point of Al and Si (577C) has been successfully applied to making Ohmic contacts on both SiQD SLs in oxide and nitride matrices. Activation energy (Ea) of SiQDs, extracted from a linear Arrhenius plot is investigated in the present work in order to expand the understanding of engineering electrical injection in laterally active paths. It is found that a lower barrier height of dielectric matrix influences to the lateral electron transport of the SiQDs in such dielectric matrix.  PL results confirm that the band gap of surface oxidized SiQDs widens due to quantum confinement. The present results reveal that the strong peak (Q-peak) due to quantum confinement is more effective in the emission with increasing SiQD concentration. The surface oxide is believed to play an important role in the reduction of SiQD luminescence due to a trapped exiciton. It is concluded that SiQDs surface oxide accompanied by a SiO2 matrix may not provide a good passivation in very small SiQD size. However the energy band gap and conductivity of the SiQDs are tunablity, in the optimum range of SiQD size and concentration. This observation may be important for future nanoelectronics applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Third generation.</field><field name="subject">Solar cells -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Solar cells -- Materials.</field><field name="subject">Silicon solar cells -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Silicon solar cells -- Materials.</field><field name="subject">Quantum dots.</field><field name="subject">Silicon dioxide matrix.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power generation.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power systems.</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor nanocrystals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being mobile: personalising the virtual, virtualising the physical.</field><field name="creator">Strakowicz, Sebastian, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the relationship between the mobile phone and its user and argue that this relationship is crucial in merging the contexts of public and private, the physical and virtual, imagined and real, past and present, author and audience. I view this relationship as crucial to understanding the shift in the role of the audience from passive receivers of content to active producers ('Mobile Produsers'). Further, I argue that the diverse contexts of mobile content production and the definition of the content itself have become the central means by which mobile phone practices are emerging. I draw on anthropology, social science and media studies in order to explore the impact of mobile contexts, content, and use on identity. I propose that this approach allows for a new understanding of mobile practices as a form of spectacle, especially what I refer to as the spectacle of the self. Produsership theory informs an understanding of mobile practices, content production and performance, and the Bahktinian concept of carnival becomes a useful term in analysing the mobile as both performance and spectacle. Through an analysis of mobile content within cinematic culture, social interaction, and mixed media environments I consider the ways in which the mobile functions not only as a tool for positioning the individual, but also as performing an integral part in a multi-user process of mobile content production. In this sense, mobile content can be understood as a map, and the mobile as a compass used by the produser to navigate the mobile?s diverse contexts. Furthermore, I demonstrate that mobile content is collectively constructed while being individually absorbed. It is reflective of both the context and its user and open to constant questioning and interpretation, which is then shared with others. Finally, this thesis explores the notion of being t/here as mode of participating with the mobile in time and space, where one's identity is distributed across virtual and physical spaces, simultaneously locating the user as both here and there (t/here).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular telephones -- Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Mass media -- Technological innovations.</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal communication -- Technological innovations -- Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Digital media -- Social aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The agony of human rights a discussion and eveluation of the illusive consensus.</field><field name="creator">Bassin, Genevieve, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">How can a normative consensus on human rights develop out of a plurality of different and conflicting ethico-cultural discourses? It is frequently assumed that any agreement on universal human rights must necessarily occur in spite of pluralism from which conflict might arise. Consequently, various images of consensus have been proposed wherein pluralism is viewed as something to be mitigated or overcome. However, such images of consensus fail to offer a satisfactory response to the original question since they fail to fully recognise the political and contestational nature of human rights discourse. This thesis aims to address questions as to how conflict and contingency, both commonly associated with pluralism, can be mediated in a way that is constructive of a particular political community, and constitutive of a vital and innovative discourse on human rights. Hence, theories on agonistic pluralism are discussed and evaluated since they address this very issue ??? the potential for struggle to act as a constructive force. Also in this thesis, a historical analysis of key milestones in the development of a human rights discourse is presented wherein it is argued that human rights have indeed been contingent upon particular instances of struggle and have found expression in a plurality of distinct  ethico-cultural discourses. Finally, in order to further illustrate the adaptability of human rights to more than one ethical discourse, examples are presented in which various Muslim scholar-activists justify human rights norms according to Islamic doctrinal principles. Overall, it is the argument of this thesis that it is possible to imagine a human rights consensus, not as a ???world consensus???, but in terms of a sectional political association whose membership is culturally pluralist. In saying this, it must be acknowledged that this construction is necessarily always precarious, precisely because of the contestational, contingent and transformative nature of the discourse of human rights. Also, although only sectional in terms of its support base, the ???consensus??? I describe necessarily strives to become a universal consensus. While universal respect for human rights is ultimately illusive, in view of the universalism of human rights as a discourse, to strive for anything less is unacceptable. In the end, the constant struggle to establish a universal consensus on human rights is precisely that which effects positive, practical change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consensus (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Human rights.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmoadaptation mechanisms of cyanobacteria and archaea from the stromatolites of hamelin pool, Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">Goh, Falicia Qi Yun, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The stromatolites of Shark Bay Western Australia, located in a hypersaline environment, is an ideal biological system for studying survival strategies of cyanobacteria and halophilic archaea to high salt and their metabolic cooperation with other bacteria. To-date, little is known of the mechanisms by which these stromatolite microorganisms adapt to hypersalinity. To understand the formation of these sedimentary structures, detailed analysis of the microbial communities and their physiology for adaptation in this environment are crucial. In this study, microbial communities were investigated using culturing and molecular methods. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out to investigate the diversity of microorganisms present. Unique phylotypes from the bacteria, cyanobacteria and archaea clone libraries were identified. Representative cyanobacteria isolates and Halococcus hamelinensis, a halophilic archaea isolated from in this study, were the focus for identifying osmoadaptation mechanisms. The presence of osmolytes in these microorganisms was detected by Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). It was found that the cyanobacterial isolates studied utilised different osmolytes. Glucosylglycerol, unique to marine cyanobacteria was not identified; instead various saccharides, glycine betaine and TMAO were the predominant solutes present. Thus cyanobacteria are likely to possess more complex mechanisms of adaptation to osmotic stress than previously thought. Findings here also indicated that H. hamelinensis accumulates glycine betaine and glutamate instead of potassium ions. DNA molecular methods were employed to identify candidate genes for the uptake of osmoprotectants. Three putative glycine betaine transporters from Halococcus hamelinensis were identified. Functionality of one of these glycine betaine transporters was determined by complementation studies. For the first time, an archaeal glycine betaine transporter was shown to be successfully complemented in a glycine betaine transport deficient mutant (E. coli MKH13). This study has increased our understanding of how microorganisms co-exist in fluctuating environments in response to solubilisation/precipitation or dilution/evaporation processes, resulting in a hypersaline environment. It also provides an excellent platform for the identification of any novel osmolytes/compatible solutes that might have been produced by these microorganisms that have been isolated for the first time from stromatolites.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stromatolites.</field><field name="subject">Stromatolites -- Westyern Australia.</field><field name="subject">Archaebacteria.</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria.</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Truth, meaning and representation: questioning modes of analysis in interpretations of women's alcohol use.</field><field name="creator">Clayton, Belinda, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">At present, there is speculation that women's alcohol use is a growing biomedical concern. Whilst not dismissing the potential health problems from excessive alcohol use by women that the evidence suggests, this thesis does not necessarily take the view that women's alcohol use/abuse is merely a reflection of a biomedical concern. Drawing predominantly from feminist tools of analysis, this thesis examines the discourse of alcohol use/abuse and reveals that mainstream interpretations of the epidemiological evidence are informed by an underlying sexism inherent in the research process itself. However, it is also argued that although popular interpretations can be contested on the grounds of sexism, there is a significant body of evidence that suggests women suffer more alcohol-related biological harm than men do. Given that epidemiological researchers are evidently observing something organically manifest, something perfectly correlative with the popular representation of a female vulnerability to alcohol related harm, this investigation cannot be reduced to the realm of cultural analysis and interpretation. The question then emerges, how can cultural assumptions that guide interpretations of the evidence become biologically manifest?  Upon deeper reflection, this investigation turns its attention to relations of power and reveals the biological body and the discourses that produce it to be more closely aligned than generally presumed. This thesis argues that nature (the body) and culture (discourse) are not inherently oppositional, thus, the way we "conceptualise" the world must be inseparable from the "matter" under investigation. Based on this revelation, it is reasonable to consider that normalising discourse, which founds the meaning-making process of alcohol use, is not simply a re-presentation of the natural/organic world, but is constitutive of, and inherently writing the biological world it describes. Thus, rather than erecting material/conceptual borders that reinforce the polarisation of the nature/culture division, this thesis proposes a way to think difference more generously, in a way that allows for a closer reconciliation of the historical division between the "theory" and the "lived" experience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women -- Alcohol use.</field><field name="subject">Women in mass media.</field><field name="subject">Sexism.</field><field name="subject">Feminism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being and doing ???Bengali-Muslims??? in Sydney: the construction of Halal and Haram.</field><field name="creator">Mahmood, Raasheed, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This is a study against essentialist generalisations. Empirically, the study has been conducted to understand the food related practices among the Bengali-Muslim migrants in Sydney based on the dichotomy of Halal (permitted in Islam) and Haram (prohibited in Islam). Instead of evaluating Islam and Muslim communities as monolithic and undifferentiated this study reveals the localised actualisation of Islam which serves as a conditioning factor for these Bengali-Muslim migrants. Adopting a naturalistic methodological approach a number of ethnographic tools have been used to reveal the complex multifaceted processes through which Sydney???s Bengali-Muslim migrants negotiate the situational convergence and divergence between their ethnic identity as Bengali and their religious identity as Muslim. As a significant site of this interplay this study discovers from their food related practices that the Bengali-Muslim migrants in Sydney construct the notion of Halal-Haram food rules and regulations through the dialectics of their Bengali-informed Islam. The Bengali version of Islam poses considerable challenge to the modernist opposition between secularism and religion which is quite inadequate to understand the way the Bengali-Muslims historically negotiate both of these in the form of overlapping consensus. The findings of the study exhibit that this situationally shifting emphasis on their secular Bengali identity at one point of time and on their religious Muslim identity at another determines their decisive practices regarding food consumption in a Western cultural milieu. The Bengali-Muslim migrant participants of this study tend to perceive the notion of Halal-Haram in multiple ways so as to fit the pragmatic realities of their migrant life, which eventually leads them to reconstruct, renegotiate or even discard the scriptural/theological/authoritative discourse. Such underlying properties of food practices vindicate the argument that any stereotypically standardised notion of ???Islam??? is inadequate to understand varied Muslim migrant communities across the globe. Rather specific Muslim migrant community should be studied along with a profound understanding of their very contextual nature and historical formations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superficial fusion of rice kernels at high temperatures as a grain toughening measure (Restricted for 24 months until Nov. 2007)</field><field name="creator">Liyanage, Nirmala Damayanthi Lelwala, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">High-temperature processing of rice needs close attention due to the susceptibility of rice grains to fissures. The present study was carried out to redress the lack of information on the quality of rice dried at high-temperatures using a range of drying air temperatures from 160 - 200??C and grain moisture contents varying from 27 to 33%wb. A laboratory type high temperature dryer-oven was developed and constructed, and the performance was compared with commercial fluidized-bed and spouted-bed dryers. The new column type treatment plant, targeted at small-scale rice farmers was designed to reduce milling breakages was tested for high-temperature treatments.  Short term drying (160 ??? 180 seconds) of high moisture rough rice at high-temperatures such as 160 - 200??C increased head rice yield by 5 - 8% in long grain rice and 7 - 11% in medium grain rice. The head rice yield increase achieved was very close to the highest potential head rice recovery possible for a given sample.  The head rice yield increase was mainly due to a hardened surface layer of the rice kernel, formed by two effects, a surface fusion and surface gelatinization during high-temperature treatment. This stress protection layer is only effective for a short period (1 - 2 minutes) at high temperatures.  Tempering of treated grains, either by storing in gunny bags or rapid cooling, can secure the grains to some extent from grain breakage. The highest head rice yield increase was obtained by ceasing the high-temperature effect at the grain moisture level of 24 - 25%wb.  The colour and appearance of high-temperature treated grains were closer to those of untreated grains with the toughness closer to that of parboiled rice. The setback values of high-temperature treated rice measured by RVA, which is a preferred character by consumers, were closer to aged rice. High-temperature treatments did not affect the cooking qualities except a slight increase in water absorption.  The alterations in the grain due to high-temperature treatment are limited to only for 8 - 9% of the total volume (mainly outer region) of the rice grain, preserving more than 90% of the grain with raw-rice quality. Structural changes such as complexing of amylose ??? lipid, amylose -protein and denaturation of protein play a dominant role on quality changes than gelatinization.  A new method introduced to measure the degree of gelatinization of pre-gelatinized rice, using hot paste viscosity by rapid visco analyser (RVA), was successful. The peak viscosity parameter in the RVA was more suitable for measuring the chemical changes in high-temperature treated rice.  Spouted-bed drying technology is not suitable for high-temperature treatment due to the unfavourable conditions for the formation of a hardened layer under intermittent heating and cooling. Fluidized-bed dryers could be used for high-temperature drying, but is not cost effective for the small-scale farmer level.  The novel type treatment plant was successful in reducing the amount of broken grains to almost zero, increasing the head rice yield by 50 - 120kg per 1000kg of rough rice. It was also effective as a germination arrester, inhibiting the germination ability within a very short period such as 30 - 60 seconds. This equipment is more effective as a treatment Plant as it reduces moisture by only 1.5 - 2.0% at highest head rice yield recovery.  An empirical model was successfully established (R2 = 0.99) for grain moisture content (db) and drying temperature during high-temperature processing. In model validation process, a good agreement was found between predicted and experimental data. The modelling between head rice yield and high-temperature drying was unsuccessful (R2 = 0.89) mainly due the interference from other factors such as initial moisture stress due to re-wetting and uncontrolled post treatment drying environment conditions.  The study revealed some breakthrough for the rice industry in addition to its quantitative evaluation of increase in head rice yield.  1. Ability to produce grains with twice the toughness of milled untreated rice, without losing colour and appearance.  2. Fissured grains, previously weakened due to moisture-stress (considered as a loss), can be successfully recovered by treating this high-temperature technique. Currently there is no method available to increase the head rice yield of this type of fissured grains except parboiling, which is not widely accepted among consumers.  3. Drying at 200??C drying temperature completely destroyed the viability of seeds within 40 -60 seconds, hence providing a remedy for germination problems in wet harvests. 4. Since high-temperature drying needs wet rough rice, early harvesting can be done which will reduce shattering losses. This enable the farmers to use the field for an inter-seasonal crop which can utilise higher residual soil moisture in the paddy fields compared to other crops.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rice</field><field name="subject">Processing</field><field name="subject">high temperature</field><field name="subject">yields</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techno-economic modelling of CO2 capture systems for Australian industrial sources.</field><field name="creator">Ho, Minh Trang Thi, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australia is recognising that carbon capture and storage (CCS) may be a feasible pathway for addressing increasing levels of CO2 emissions. This thesis presents a preliminary economic assessment and comparison of the capture costs for different Australian CO2 emission sources. The capture technologies evaluated include solvent absorption, pressure swing adsorption (PSA), gas separation membranes and low temperature separation. The capture cost estimated for hydrogen production, IGCC power plants and natural gas processing is less than A$30/tonne CO2 avoided. CO2 capture cost for iron production ranges from A$30 to A$40 per tonne CO2 avoided. Higher costs of A$40 to over A$80 per tonne CO2 avoided were estimated for flue gas streams from pulverised coal and NGCC power plants, oil refineries and cement facilities, and IDGCC synthesis gas. Based on 2004 and 2005 EU ETS carbon prices (A$30 to A$45 per tonne CO2 avoided), the cost of capture using current commercially available absorption technology may deter wide-scale implementation of CCS, in particular for combustion processes. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to explore the opportunities for reducing costs. The high cost for capture using solvent absorption is dependent on the energy needed for solvent regeneration and the high capital costs. Cost reductions can be achieved by using new low regeneration energy solvents coupled with recycling the waste heat from the absorption process back to the steam cycle, and using low cost ???fit-for-purpose??? equipment. For membrane and PSA technologies, the capture costs are dominated by the flue gas and post-capture compressors. Operating the permeate or desorption stream under vacuum conditions provides significant cost reductions. Improvements in membrane and adsorbent characteristics such as the adsorbent loading or membrane permeability, CO2 selectivity, and lower prices for the membrane or adsorbent material provide further cost benefits. For low partial pressure CO2 streams, capture using low temperature ???anti-sublimation??? separation can be an alternative option. Low costs could be achieved by operating under low pressures and integrating with external sources of waste heat.  Applying the cost reductions achievable with technology and process improvements reduces the capture and CCS costs to a level less than current carbon prices, making CCS an attractive mitigation option.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CO2 capture.</field><field name="subject">Techno-economic modelling.</field><field name="subject">Absorption.</field><field name="subject">Membranes.</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide -- Industrial applications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and decision processes in classification and feature inference.</field><field name="creator">Sweller, Naomi, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined how task demands shape the category representations formed through classification, inference and incidental learning. Experiments 1 to 3 examined the claim that the representations formed through inference learning are based only on the encoding of prototypical features (e.g., Yamauchi &amp; Markman, 1998, 2000). Adults learned artificial categories through exemplar classification or feature inference. Inference learning either did or did not require attention to prototypical features. At test, all participants classified exemplars and inferred the values of missing features. Classification learning resulted in the encoding of both prototypical and atypical features. Inference learning also led to the representation of both prototypical and atypical features when attention to both was required during learning. Experiment 4 extended these results to inferences about novel items varying in similarity to training items. Inference learners required to attend to prototypical and atypical features during training were more sensitive to exemplar similarity when making novel inferences than those who attended only to prototypical features.  Experiment 5 examined developmental change in the impact of noun and feature labels on feature inferences. Adults, 7-year-olds, and 5-yearolds were shown pairs of base and target exemplars. The base was given a noun or feature label. Participants were asked to predict the value of a missing feature of the target, when it was given the same or a different label as the base. Both adults and children were more likely to make inferences based on noun than feature labels. Hence, by five years of age, children grasp the inductive potential of noun labels. Experiments 6 to 9 compared incidental category learning with intentional classification. Adults classified categories of geometric shapes or learned the categories through an incidental task. Incidental recognition learning resulted in a broader allocation of attention than classification learning. Performing recognition before classification resulted in a broader attentional allocation than performing recognition after classification. Together with the results from mathematical modelling, these findings support a view of category learning in which the specific attentional demands of different learning tasks determine the nature of the category representations that are acquired.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning, Psychology of.</field><field name="subject">Categorization (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Inference.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</field><field name="creator">Vucic, Ostoja Steve, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the pathophysiology of motor neurone dysfunction, along with site of disease onset, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The rationale for this thesis is the "dying forward" hypothesis, which suggests that corticomotoneurons cause anterograde excitotoxic degeneration of motor neurons in ALS. Initially, axonal excitability studies were applied to ALS patients and revealed widespread axonal ion channel dysfunction, with increases in persistent Na+ conductances and reduction in K+ currents. Such changes result in axonal hyperexcitability, thereby resulting in generation of fasciculations and cramps. Subsequently, axonal excitability studies were applied to Kennedy's disease (KD) patients, a pathological control group, revealing similar changes to ALS and suggesting that upregulation of persistent Na+ conductances was responsible for generation of fasciculations.  To better understand the mechanisms underlying fatigability and to assess whether Na+/K+ pump dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS, activity-dependent changes in axonal excitability were measured after a maximal voluntary contraction. The increase in threshold was more pronounced in ALS patients with predominantly lower motor neuron involvement, suggesting that peripheral factors were responsible for fatigue in ALS and that Na+/K+ pump function was preserved.  Having documented abnormalities of axonal excitability, a novel threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique was developed for assessment of cortical excitability. This technique overcomes the marked variability in the motor evoked potential with consecutive stimuli, a major limitation of the previous "constant stimulus" technique. After establishing normative data, threshold tracking TMS established that cortical hyperexcitability was an early and prominent feature in ALS. Similar changes were found in flail-arm variant ALS, a pure lower motor neuron form of ALS. In KD patients, cortical excitability was normal, thereby suggesting that cortical hyperexcitability is a primary event in ALS rather than a down-regulation of inhibitory control over the motor cortex in order to compensate for anterior horn cell loss.  In order to determine whether cortical hyperexcitability underlies motor neurodegeneration, longitudinal studies were undertaken in familial ALS subjects with the copper/zinc superoxide-dismutase-1 gene mutation. These studies established that cortical hyperexcitability precedes the development of clinical ALS, thereby suggesting that cortical hyperexcitability underlies the basis of motor neurodegeneration in familial ALS.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</field><field name="subject">Physiological, Pathological.</field><field name="subject">Motoer Neuron Disease -- Therapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indonesian foreign policy: a quest for the balance of threats. The role and relevance of elite perceptions in explaining Indonesian foreign policy outcomes.</field><field name="creator">Novotny, Daniel, School of Politics  &amp;  International  Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is a comprehensive account of Indonesian foreign policy. It analyses the perceptions of the country???s foreign policy elite about other states and the manner in which these shape the decision-making process and determine policy outcomes. It demonstrates that the dynamics of Indonesian foreign relations in the reformasi period can be understood in terms of elite perceptions. Policy-makers??? perceptions are as important as realities, insofar as they shape their real actions. The balance-of-threat theory is the principal analytical tool used to examine elite perceptions. The study argues that the key realist balance-of-power theory lacks the power to explain past dynamics or to predict future direction of Indonesian foreign relations. The balance-of-threat theory is employed here as a predictor about how Indonesia will behave and whether it will implement policies intended to prevent other countries from endangering Indonesia???s national interests and security. The combined qualitative and quantitative research strategy is based on, but by no means limited to, archival study, content analysis of literature and official statements of relevant Indonesian policy-makers and the survey data. The latter approach draws on a series of 45 in-depth interviews with members of the Indonesian foreign policy elite. Indonesian relations with the United States and China are the highest concern of the elite. The leaders believe that, in the future, Indonesia will increasingly have to manoeuvre between the two rival powers. While the United States is currently seen as the main security threat to Indonesia, China is considered the main malign factor in the long run with power capabilities that need to be constrained and counter-balanced. The ambiguity, dichotomy and haphazardness that have characterized Indonesian foreign policy in the reformasi period are caused by four factors: first, the existence of a plurality of disparate views and attitudes among the contemporary Indonesian elite; second, the perceived complex security challenges on all fronts that are both internal and external in origins and traditional and non-traditional in nature; third, a low level of elite consensus about how to rank the external threats according to their urgency; and, fourth, a significant disparity between the elite???s present threat assessment and its long-term threat assessment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fertility decisions and the sustainability of public pension systems.</field><field name="creator">Steurer, Miriam, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chapter 2: Welfare comparisons between funded and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) or unfunded pension systems are often made using the Aaron condition (Aaron, 1966). However, the Aaron condition as usually stated is not precise enough about the exact form of the PAYG pension system. PAYG pension systems can be either of the defined benefit or defined contribution variety. They can also differ with regard to intra-generational redistribution, for example pension benefits can be flat or earnings related. Here, four alternative PAYG pension systems are considered. It is shown that each system generates its own Aaron condition. In addition, the standard Aaron condition assumes that the wage rate and labour participation rate does not vary across individuals. These assumptions are also relaxed. Using US data covering the period 1933-2001, it is shown that the results of welfare comparisons are highly sensitive to different specifications of PAYG systems. Chapter 3: The sustainability of a defined benefit pay-as-you-go (DBPAYG) pension system is investigated in the context of an overlapping-generations model of endogenous fertility. The model places particular emphasis on the time costs of child rearing. It illustrates the mechanism by which such a pension system can increase the opportunity cost of having children and hence sow the seeds of its own destruction. The model is then extended to allow for fertility-based payments. Such a system is more likely to be sustainable. These models highlight a number of issues that are of considerable relevance to a number of OECD countries that have generous DBPAYG pension systems and falling fertility rates. Chapter 4: The previous chapter focused on transition dynamics, while this chapter investigates steady state outcomes of fertility based defined benefit pay-as-you-go (DB-PAYG) pension systems in the context of an overlapping-generations model with endogenous fertility and heterogeneous agents. Special attention is paid to the impact on fertility, utility, taxation, and per capita saving. Chapter 5: A two-stage bargaining model is developed to describe how fertility decisions are made in a strategic family setting. Given the assumption that family contracts are incomplete and cannot be used to enforce optimal behaviour, it is shown that investments in children (i.e. the fertility rate) may be sub-optimal. This is because the woman may find it in her interest to invest too little in children in stage 1 of the model in order to protect her bargaining status in stage 2. The chapter then considers in the context of this model the impact on fertility rates of changes in child custody rules (in the case of divorce), the wage rate, and the male-female wage differential. It concludes by exploring how the introduction of child subsidies can change the results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A behavioural finance perspective on trade imbalance and stock prices</field><field name="creator">Henker, Julia, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I examine, within a behavioural finance framework, the impact on stock prices of order and trade imbalance in three separate but related studies. The first study, chapter two, begins with a question that plagues behavioural finance theories???do the investors most likely to be influenced by the behavioural biases described in the literature, i.e., individual investors, affect stock prices? My data enable me to consider the impact of net individual investor trading for the entire market over several years. I find that net individual investor purchasing Grangercauses stock price changes. The correlation is negative, however, contradicting common sense by demonstrating that individuals investor buying pressure makes prices go down and selling pressure forces them up. More investigation is required. Chapter three references order imbalance results from experimental finance. I use field data to test a robust laboratory model and my modified versions. My findings suggest that, with appropriate modifications, laboratory results can be applied to real financial markets. Chapter four combines the data from the chapters two and three to revisit the question of individual investor impact on stock prices. Other studies have argued that individual investor influence is strongest in smaller capitalization stocks. Moreover, various theories propose that individual investors are the driving force behind the irrational stock prices of a bubble. I focus on the stocks from chapter three, bubble stocks, and ask whether, in the context of the trading of the entire market, individual investor trades are influential. Once again I find Grangercausality, but in the wrong direction. Moreover, the activity and volume of the individual investor category of the holdings data is completely overshadowed by that of the two large investor categories, domestic and foreign institutions. I conclude that individual investor trades are not influential in determining stock prices. This conclusion has important implications for some behavioural finance models of asset pricing. I suggest that emphasis might be better placed on educating individual investors about the errors to which they are prone, rather than on trying to explain market anomalies with those errors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stocks -- prices -- psychological aspects; investments; speculation; business cycles; financial crises; balance of trade</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deconstructing the racialisation experience of Asian Australians: process, impact and response</field><field name="creator">Hollero, Maria Elisa, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study uses racialisation as a lens to understand the racist experiences of ordinary Asian Australians. It examines the racialisation processes underlying these experiences and explores the strategies employed to respond to and mitigate the impact of being racialised. It addresses the need to develop the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of racialisation and anti-racism in light of the dearth of research work on these especially in Australia.  Different elements from various theories were drawn to frame the empirical investigation since no single theory was adequate as anchor for this qualitative study. In-depth interviews and focus groups with 64 Asian Australians generated rich narratives that provided interesting insights on the personal, political, and spiritual dimensions of human experience that connect the lives of racialised subjects.  Deconstructing stories of racialised subjects laid bare the essence of racist experiences by revealing insights into when and how race becomes a salient signifier of difference. Racialisation provides a productive way of understanding racist experiences since it allows for the unpacking of the multi-layered linked processes of racial categorisation, racial differentiation and problematisation, marginalisation and exclusion, inferiorisation and devaluation. These processes are ordinarily part of the experiences of minority people. They constitute what can be called 'everyday racialisation'.  The study uses stress-coping theory to examine the long-term and cumulative impact of being part of a racialised group. It shows how exposure to racism stressors has multifarious effects on the health and well-being of racialised subjects. The everyday racialisation of minority groups affects their socio-psychological functioning and limits the life chances and economic opportunities available to them.  In addition, the study demonstrates how Asian Australians cope with the stress of their everyday racialisation by drawing from their personal repertoire of discursive, cognitive and behavioural strategies. These, in combination with outside support mechanisms, make up what can be termed ?everyday anti-racism? strategies. Racialisation provides valuable insights into when, how and why racialised subjects deploy these different strategies to negotiate, contest and bridge the constraints and boundaries imposed on them.  The study offers an integrated model for understanding racialisation experience and lays the foundation for developing further the concepts of  'everyday racialisation' and 'everyday antiracism'.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asians -- Australia -- Ethnic identity -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Asians -- Australia -- Social conditions -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Racism -- Australia -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Immigrants -- Australia -- Social conditions -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Race relations -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Artist-God who ???disguides his voice???: a reading of Joseph Campbell???s interpretation of the dreamer of Finnegans Wake</field><field name="creator">Skuthorpe, Barret, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with engaging a critic who has been neglected by his peers in the field of Joyce studies for more than forty years. This critic, Joseph Campbell, is an American scholar more popularly known for his studies in myth. However, he began his intellectual career contributing to a subject that emerged in the early years of the critical reception of Finnegans Wake: that the dream depicted in Joyce???s final masterpiece is dependent on a Dreamer. The neglect Campbell???s work has endured is largely due, this thesis argues, to an inaccurate treatment of his reading of this dream figure. This inaccuracy largely stems from a critic, Clive Hart, who engages with the debate of the Dreamer as an introductory means to demonstrating the ???structural??? theories involved in the Wake. As a minor feature of Hart???s analysis, Campbell???s theory of the Dreamer is identified with another method, one belonging to a fellow American Joycean, Edmund Wilson, a method incongruent with Campbell theories of dream consciousness. Subsequently, Campbell remains an undeveloped scholar within Joyce criticism. To counter Hart???s inaccurate depiction of Campbell, this thesis argues that there is provision in early scholarship to re-evaluate Campbell???s theory of the Dreamer in more developed terms. In this respect, the thesis is divided up into three sections. The first section is a literary review of this early scholarship, demonstrating certain influential strains of thought equivalent to Campbell???s ???metaphoric??? concept of the Dreamer, one that contrasts with the rigid, ???literal??? ideas his work is predominantly identified. The second section examines Campbell???s account in detail and the specific criticism it drew from Hart. Finally, the third section argues that Campbell???s interpretation of the Dreamer is best engaged through an archetypal account of the Dreamer, one that regards the symbols encountered in the Wake through the ???guiding??? features of a mythological concept of the psyche sensitive to the reflexive tendencies of the dream portrayed, Campbell???s ???cosmogonic cycle???.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campbell</field><field name="subject">Joseph -- Criticism and interpretation; Joyce</field><field name="subject">James -- Finnegans wake -- criticism and interpretation; dreams in literature; psychological fiction; history and criticism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petroleum well costs</field><field name="creator">Leamon, Gregory Robert, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This is the first academic study of well costs and drilling times for Australia???s petroleum producing basins, both onshore and offshore. I analyse a substantial database of well times and costs sourced from government databases, industry and over 400 recent well completion reports. Three well phases are studied - Pre-Spud, Drilling and Completion. Relationships between well cost factors are considered, including phase time, phase cost, daily cost, rig day rate, well depth, basin, rig type, water depth, well direction, well objective (e.g. exploration), and type of completion (P&amp;A or producer). Times and costs are analysed using scatter plots, frequency distributions, correlation and regression analyses. Drilling times are analysed for the period 1980 to 2004. Well time and variability in well time tend to increase exponentially with well depth. Technical Limits are defined for both onshore and offshore drilling times to indicate best performance. Well costs are analysed for the period 1996 to 2004. Well costs were relatively stable for this period. Long term increases in daily costs were offset to some extent by reductions in drilling times. Onshore regions studied include the Cooper/Eromanga, Surat/Bowen, Otway and Perth Basins. Offshore regions studied include the Carnarvon Basin shallow and deepwater, the Timor Sea and Victorian Basins. Correlations between regional well cost and well depth are usually high. Well costs are estimated based on well location, well depth, daily costs and type of completion. In 2003, the cost of exploration wells in Australia ranged from A$100,000 for shallow coal seam gas wells in the Surat/Bowen Basins to over A$50 million for the deepwater well Gnarlyknots-1 in the Great Australian Bight. Future well costs are expected to be substantially higher for some regions. This study proposes methods to index historical daily costs to future rig day rates as a means for estimating future well costs. Regional well cost models are particularly useful for the economic evaluation of CO2 storage sites which will require substantial numbers of petroleum-type wells.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oil well drilling -- Australia; Petroleum -- Prospecting -- Australia -- Costs -- Petroleum engineering -- Petroleum industry and trade.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telepathy in contemporary, conceptual and performance art</field><field name="creator">Drinkall, Jacquelene Ashley, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of telepathy and psi on conceptual and performance art from 1968. Emerging from the author???s art practice, the thesis argues telepathy is a key leitmotif and creative concern within much post 60s art, and has become central to the practice of a number of contemporary video, performance and new media artists. This thesis is composed of two interrelated parts: an exhibition of the artwork by the author concerning telepathic processes, and a written project which uses the major themes of the exhibition to frame an historical study of a number of key contemporary artists whom, it is argued, work with telepathy. These artists, Jane and Louise Wilson, Suzanne Treister and Susan Hiller are discussed under the themes of ???twinning and doubling,??? ???technological mediums??? and ???telepathy experiments???. These themes also overlap in the authors artwork, are introduced through an overarching analysis of the work of performance artist Marina Abramovi?? and philosopher Jacques Derrida who, it is argued, provide a new model of telepathy as an art practice. In addition, the thesis argues that telepathy is an often suppressed thematic in art which may not appear to directly address it, and uses the work on the Wilsons, Treister and Hiller to re-look at other 20th Century artists and artistic themes in the light of the conclusions it draws on telepathy and art. Walter Benjamin greatly admired the Surrealists, but had virtually no time for their interest in telepathy, hypnosis and psi. Together with positive materialist misappropriations of Adorno???s Thesis Against Occultism, artistic and theoretical work with telepathy and psi has been sidelined from other important themes in art and critical theory, all of which telepathy and psi illuminate, energise and empower. The art of the author and other more recognised and established artists can be seen to work with telepathy in ways that flow into and reinforce the grain of progressive leftist practice and aesthetics. Women???s work with telepathy should be considered as important as women???s work with sexuality. Women, sexuality, Otherness, liminality, spirituality, telepathy, trauma, healing, radical politics, and other taboo areas of patriachal codes, were adandoned by macho participants of fluxus and Conceptual art. The recent conceptual and performance tilt in contemporary art sheds new light on the problem of working within and developing an effective and dynamic lineage of telepathy in post 60s art as well as early modern art movements. Contemporary developments in science, engineering, biology, psychoanalysis, warfare, popular culture and sociology show the wider relevance of discourse on telepathy. There is much at stake for visual art, aesthetics and visuality in representing, celebrating and interrogating the theme of psi and telepathy in current practice and art history. Artists??? work with telepathy and psi, although not always explicitly psychological, political or aesthetic, is often very psychologically, politically and aesthetically effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telepathy</field><field name="subject">modern art</field><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">conceptual art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private equity and venture capital instruments, a study into their use and intention.</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Dean, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Moral Hazard and the Agency Costs thereof have long been accepted arguments in venture finance theory and have therefore long been accepted shortcomings in the venture capitalist / entrepreneur relationship. In psychological experiments ??? including economic ??? it has been shown that human beings prefer to act in a reciprocal manner that reduces any inequity in a relationship. Humans who expect to receive an unfair and inequitable position in a relationship, will take steps to rectify that position. Specifically, if a venture capitalist expects the entrepreneur to unfairly extract private benefits from the investee company post investment by the venture capitalist, then he or she will impose costly controls and monitoring mechanisms in place to prevent that. All relationships that impose controls and monitoring mechanisms are inefficient, as opposed to Advising the investee which draws upon the skills of the venture capitalist and is generally efficient. The venture capital industry is comprised of intelligent and professional people who can recognise inefficiency easily. Indeed, this is how they make poorly managed companies into profitable trade sales or IPO???s. The online survey completed for this thesis poses questions that attempt to show that venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are not locked in an antagonistic relationship where each merely acts in a self interested way.

The study investigates the nature of organisational learning within Taiwanese institute of technology academic libraries, and in particular the nature of the relationship between the formal institutional evaluation (IE) of those libraries by the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the organisational responses of the libraries. A ???process, phase of organisational learning (PPOL)??? model guided the delineation of research variables and the collection and analysis of data. The subjects of the research were 67 academic libraries and their staff. Phase I of the study consisted pf a questionnaire survey of 312 staff. The results of the survey formed the basis of Phase II of the study, the semi-structured interviews with 24 library personnel, together with an examination of relevant documents of the particular libraries involved. The refinement of the PPOL model is an indication that generally the direction and the use of IE, while recognised by management and employees, do not in most cases translate into higher levels of organisational learning and change. The findings of this thesis apply to the particular types of libraries studied, and to the concept of evaluation and organisational learning. Libraries are automatically to some extent involved in self-evaluation because they must prepare for IE, with some assistance from their institution. However, this does not imply that if various changes occur in the libraries there must be a strong correlation with the existence of high organisational learning. The external nature of the evaluation and the lengthy time periods between evaluations are two factors which make the learning response of libraries more difficult to determine. Ideally, an IE will assist the library on a path of continuous organisational adaptation, which involves structural, communication and climate changes. These changes reflect the ongoing organisational learning activities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic libraries -- Taiwan; Organisational learning -- Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network mobility management for next generation mobile systems</field><field name="creator">Perera, Algamakoralage Eranga Gayani, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The future Internet will need to cater for an increasing number of powerful devices and entire groups of networks to roam in heterogeneous access networks. The current approach towards meeting such requirements, which is to retrofit mobility solutions to different layers of the protocol stack, has given rise to an increasingly fragmented network control layer. Furthermore, retrofitting solutions in an ad-hoc manner to the protocol stack does not provide consistent support from the network to different applications. This lack of a common control layer for facilitating roaming in heterogeneous networking environments represents a crucial challenge both technically and from a user perspective. To this end, a novel mobility architecture forms the basis and the first part of this dissertation.  The work on investigating current network mobility solutions and improving these solutions if deemed necessary, in order to reuse within the novel mobility architecture constitutes the second part of this dissertation. The IETF standard protocol for network mobility was implemented and its performance was analysed on a real networking environment. This enabled to identify problems in the standard which affect the handover and routing performance. To address the identified routing and protocol header overheads of the standard network mobility protocol a novel optimal routing framework, OptiNets was proposed. To address the handover latency issues, optimizations to IPv6 network attachment were incorporated and also an access technology independent multiple interface Make-Before-Break handover mechanism was proposed. The viability of the OptiNets framework and the handover optimizations were demonstrated by analysis and by implementation. A more general external factor that affects the performance of mobile networks which is bandwidth scarcity of Wireless Wide Area Networks was addressed, by proposing a bandwidth fuelling architecture for on-board mobile networks. The feasibility of the bandwidth fuelling architecture was analysed by implementing a prototype and evaluating its performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Wireless Internet.</field><field name="subject">Ambient intelligence.</field><field name="subject">Mobile computing.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Ubiquitous computing.</field><field name="subject">Internetworking (Telecommunication)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the process of satisfaction formation: towards a contingency perspective</field><field name="creator">Wang, Cheng, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Consumer satisfaction is a central topic in marketing. In the literature, a variety of conceptual models have been developed to capture the satisfaction formation process, with the dominant framework being the disconfirmation paradigm. However, despite its widespread acceptance and support, there is still a lack of clarity, especially regarding the role and relative importance of perceived performance in determining satisfaction. It has been suggested that satisfaction research has advanced into a stage where potential moderator variables need to be examined in order to explain previous mixed findings.  The current research proposes a contingency model of the satisfaction formation process, which posits that the nature of the relationships between satisfaction and its two key antecedents (i.e., perceived performance and disconfirmation) is contingent on one situational moderator (ambiguity) and two individual moderators (experience and involvement). Empirical testing of the model is in the form of a cross-sectional survey in China's mobile phone services industry using a convenience student sample obtained from one Chinese university. The results show that both disconfirmation and perceived performance have a direct impact on satisfaction under conditions of low experience or high involvement, whereas satisfaction is solely determined by perceived performance in situations of high experience or low involvement. In addition, the results also support a joint moderator influence of ambiguity and experience on the relationships between satisfaction and its antecedents, which is especially true in the case of high ambiguity and low experience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction -- measurement.</field><field name="subject">Research -- Methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Propane reforming under carboninduced deactivation: catalyst design and reactor operation</field><field name="creator">Hardiman, Kelfin Martino, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Steam reforming is the most economical and widely-used route for the conversion of light hydrocarbon (such as natural gas) to various valued-added products. This process is commonly carried out over a low-cost alumina-supported nickel catalyst, which often suffers from carbon deposition resulting in loss of active sites, flow and thermal maldistribution, as well as excessive pressure drop.  A bimetallic catalyst with improved anti-coking properties was formulated by incorporating the nickel-based system (15% loading) with cobalt metal (5% loading). Two-level factorial design was employed to investigate the effect of major preparation variables, namely impregnation pH value (2-8), calcination temperature (873-973 K), heating rate (5-20 K min-1) and time (1-5 h).  The catalysts prepared were subjected to various characterisation techniques to determine key physicochemical properties (i.e. BET area, H2-chemisorption and NH3- TPD acidity). X-ray diffraction revealed that NiO, Co3O4, NiCo2O4 and a proportion of Ni(Co)Al2O4 aluminates were transformed during H2-reduction to active Co and Ni crystallites. TEM images showed an egg yolk profile in the low-pH catalyst suggesting that main deposition site was located in the particle centre, while metal deposition occurred primarily around the particle exterior for the high-pH catalyst. Temperature programmed experiments were carried out to examine the extent of conversion, type of surface species and solid-state kinetics (using the Avrami-Erofeev model) involved during various stages in catalyst life-cycle (calcination, reduction, oxidation and regeneration). Steam reforming analysis suggested that enhanced catalyst activity may be due to synergism in the Co-Ni catalyst. Specifically, the low-pH catalyst exhibited better resistance towards carbon-induced deactivation than the high-pH formulation. The study also provided the first attempt to develop a quantitative relation between catalyst preparation conditions and its performance (activity, product selectivity and deactivation) for steam reforming reaction.  Deactivation and reforming kinetic coefficients were simultaneously evaluated from propane reforming conversion-time data under steam-to-carbon ratios of 0.8-1.6 and reaction temperatures between 773-873 K. The time-dependent optimum operational policy derived based on these rate parameters gave better conversion stability despite the heavy carbon deposit. Thermal runs further showed that the catalysts regenerated via two-stage reductive-oxidative coke burn-off exhibited superior surface properties compared to those rejuvenated by a single-step oxidation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Propane.</field><field name="subject">Catalytic reforming.</field><field name="subject">Nickel catalysts.</field><field name="subject">Catalytic cracking.</field><field name="subject">Hydrocarbons.</field><field name="subject">Catalysts.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I am because we are</field><field name="creator">Love, Rodney, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis contextualizes the three series of work that I have produced for my MFA.

I also suggest that an underlying sense of communitas, or equality, is evoked through lists of names. I explore this idea further in an examination of various memorials where the naming of those commemorated is a major element of the work. I then describe the work that I have made, and connect it to other artworks that also use lists of names in order to explore the idea of what it is to be both an individual and a member of a group. I suggest that artworks and memorials are potent as carriers of symbolic meaning because they allow space and time for contemplation. In addition to the use of names, I also look at artworks that use items that have belonged to people as substitutes for those people, and as metaphors for humanity. My work utilises human hair and socks, but other artists use different types of contiguous possessions as stand-ins for individuals.

Procedures and results A cross-sectional study of 109 women compared a ???cancer-specific??? self-report questionnaire (FACT-F) (canvassing fatigue symptoms) and a more generic questionnaire (SPHERE) (identifying depression and fatigue). Thirty-seven percent of women reported fatigue. Overall in 20%, fatigue was associated with psychological distress. Seventeen percent of women had fatigue but no depression. A qualitative study utilised focus groups to identify and compare the distinctive features of CRF with those of women with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A similar set of symptoms was found in both groups, including overwhelming fatigue, un-refreshing sleep and subjective concentration problems. However, women with CFS also reported myalgia and arthralgia. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for Neurasthenia- SCIN, the third study compared the symptoms of three groups of women with fatigue: those with CRF, CFS or major depression. The detailed ???interviewer guide??? provided explicit directions for evaluating and classifying symptoms. This study confirmed the core symptom of ???profound fatigue unrelieved by rest???, and additional features that distinguished between the clinical diagnoses. The fourth study compared features of the evolution of clinically-identified fatigue syndromes in women from two prospective cohort studies; women with post-cancer fatigue (PCF) and women with post-infective fatigue syndrome (PIFS). Major conclusions A syndrome of PCF, present at least six months following adjuvant treatment and unexplained by medical or psychiatric disorder was investigated. The characteristics of PCF and those of CFS are very similar, with the fatigue state having indistinguishable descriptors. Longitudinal evaluation of the symptom complexes of PCF and PIFS suggests divergent pathways may be relevant. Co-morbid features like sleep disturbance; physical deconditioning and mood disturbance may be implicated as factors in the evolution and prolongation of PCF. These studies provide a basis for a more uniform and rigorous classification system - a necessary first step towards advancing the field both in investigating aetiology and new intervention strategies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- cancer; Cancer -- adjuvant treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of critical size sheep cranial defect model for study of bone graft substitute</field><field name="creator">Ho, Ken Choong Khoon, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This is an original study to quantify and grade defect healing in a large animal cranial bone substitute model. The study of various therapies to heal cranial defects requires an appropriate ?critical? animal model. An experimental animal model should be analogous and recognizable as an appropriate challenge to human physiology. In addition, the defect must fail to heal unless treated with the tissue engineering therapy under study. Sheep as a large animal model was chosen because of its ability to tolerate creation of large skull defects analogous to clinical scenario, and its biology of healing as a high order mammal would be closer human beings. There is no agreement on the critical size limits for cranial defects. Various sizes have been termed "critical" in publications utilizing sheep. These ranged from 20-22mm. This study will investigate whether a 20mm defect is adequate.  Bilateral circular cranial defects of 10, 20 and 25mm diameters were created in 12 adult sheep. Based on guided tissue engineering principles, defect protection was utilized to prevent in-growth of fibroblasts and other connective tissue cells from the surroundings. As bone tissue regeneration strategies usually involve osteoconduction element, an animal model that considered the defect protection role of osteoconduction would be more appropriate. Repopulation and regeneration of the defect was maximized as an added challenge Bioresorbable polylactic acid co-polymer mesh (MacroPoreTM) and Titanium mesh (TiMeshTM) was used as defect protection.  The cranial defects were harvested at 8 and 16 weeks. The end-point analysis included Faxitron X-ray images, DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry), and histology. The defects were graded to assess their ability to eventually heal. 10mm defects fully healed at 16 weeks. There was new bone formation spanning the entire defect seen on histology. 25mm defects were spanned by thin fibrous tissue only. There was variability in the healing potential of 20mm defect. Based on presence of bone islands within the defect, half of the 20mm defects demonstrated ability to heal while the other half actually had new bone spanning the defects on histology. Critical size cranial defect in sheep for the study of bone graft substitute has to be larger than 25mm diameter. The model is then utilized to study the use of Pro Osteon and AGF compared with the gold standard of autologous bone graft.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cranial manipulation.</field><field name="subject">bones -- pathophysiology.</field><field name="subject">bone-grafting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of the variation of fundamental constants in atoms</field><field name="creator">Angstmann, Elizabeth, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Interest in the variation of fundamental constants has recently been stimulated by claims that the fine structure constant, &#945;, was smaller in the past. Physicists are investigating whether &#945; is currently varying using a number of methods including atomic clock experiments and quasar absorption spectra. To date atomic clock experiments have not reached the same level of precision as the quasar results but the precision to which transition frequencies are being measured is increasing dramatically and very soon atomic clock experiments based on Earth will be able to rival or surpass the quasar results. In order to relate the change in transition frequencies to a variation of &#945; accurate calculations of relativistic effects in atoms and their dependence upon &#945; are needed. Other effects, such as the small shift of transition frequencies due to blackbody radiation also need to be accounted for.  In this thesis we perform accurate calculations of the dependence of transition frequencies in two-valence-electron atoms and ions on a variation of &#945;. The relativistic Hartree-Fock method is used with many-body perturbation theory and configuration interaction methods to calculate transition frequencies.  We also consider transitions with an enhanced sensitivity to &#945; variation. In particular, narrow lines that correspond to atomic transitions between close lying, long-lived atomic states of different configurations. The small transition frequency, coupled with differences in the electron structure ensures a strong enhancement of the relative frequency change compared to a possible change in &#945; . We also show that using the modified form of the Dirac Hamiltonian, as suggested by Bekenstein, does not affect the analysis of the quasar data pertaining to a measurement of &#945; variation, nor does it affect atomic clock experiments.  Finally we have performed calculations of the size of the frequency shift induced by a static electric field on the clock transition frequencies of the hyperfine splitting in Y b+, Rb, Cs, Ba+, and Hg+. The calculations are used to find the frequency shifts due to blackbody radiation which are needed for accurate frequency measurements and improvements of the limits on variation of &#945;. Our result for Cs [??v/=E2 = -2:26(2) x 10-10Hz/(V/m)2] is in good agreement with early measurements and ab initio calculations. We present arguments against recent claims that the actual value might be smaller. The difference (~ 10%) is due to the continuum spectrum in the sum over intermediate states.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics.</field><field name="subject">Particles (nuclear physics)</field><field name="subject">Atomic units.</field><field name="subject">Fine structure constant.</field><field name="subject">Variational principles.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reporting intangible assets: voluntary disclosure practices of the top emerging market companies</field><field name="creator">Kang, Helen Hyon Ju, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of financial reporting is to provide information that is useful for decision making. Recently, however, there has been a systematic decline in the usefulness of such information. Indeed, the current reporting model seems to be no longer sufficient mainly due to the fact that it ignores many of the nonfinancial intangible factors which are increasingly becoming important in determining corporate value and performance. That is, there is a need for the traditional reporting model to be modified or at least broadened to reflect Intangible Assets (IA) in order to enhance the usefulness of information being provided to different stakeholders. In the absence of mandatory reporting requirements, one alternative way of disseminating information regarding IA is to engage in voluntary disclosure practices. It has also been suggested that companies which would benefit the most from such practice are those originating from emerging economies looking to expand into international markets. While there exists an array of empirical studies which have examined the voluntary disclosure practices of corporations from developed economies, less considered are the reporting practices of emerging market companies regarding their IA. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the voluntary disclosure practices of the top 200 emerging market companies regarding the variety, nature and extent of IA and to consider some of the factors that may be associated with the level of such disclosure. Using a disclosure index based on the Value Chain Scoreboard??? (Lev, 2001), narrative sections of the 2002 annual reports of the top 200 emerging market companies are analysed. The findings indicate that emerging market companies engage in voluntary disclosure practices in order to disseminate different varieties of mainly quantitative IA information to their global stakeholders. Further, the variety and the extent of IA disclosure are associated with corporate specific factors such as leverage, adoption of IFRS/US GAAP, industry type, and price to book ratio. Contrary to the existing literature on voluntary disclosure, however, firm size and ownership concentration are not found to be associated with the IA disclosure level. Country specific factors such as the level of risks associated with economic policy and legal system are also found to be significantly associated with the IA voluntary disclosure level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intangible property -- accounting; corporation reports; financial statements; corporations -- valuation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PACMAN: a personal-network centric approach to context and mobility aware networking</field><field name="creator">Herborn, Stephen, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Users (or software agents) are served by multiple networked terminal devices, each of which may in turn have multiple network interfaces. This multi-homing at both ???user??? and ???device??? level presents new opportunities for mobility handling. Mobility may be handled by switching ongoing application data streams between devices, by utilising intermediary adaptation or connectivity enhancement services, or both. However this requires middleware support that is not provided by current systems. This thesis presents a set of integrated solutions to enable this kind of mobility handling, based on concept of Personal Networks (PN). Personal Networks (PN) consist of dynamic conglomerations of terminal and service devices tasked to facilitate the delivery of information to and from a single focal point, which may be a  human user or software agent. This concept creates the potential to view mobility handling as a path selection problem, since there may be multiple valid terminal device and service proxy configurations that can successfully carry a given communication session from one PN to another PN. Depending on context, it may be necessary to switch between paths. To this end, this thesis proposes and evaluates a set of inter-dependent mechanisms to facilitate the discovery and use of different candidate end-to-end paths. The proposal comprises mechanisms for secure inter-device mobility using delegated cryptographic identifiers, autonomous service proxy selection and composition, and distributed resolution of cryptographic identifiers to lower layer addresses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile networks</field><field name="subject">nemo</field><field name="subject">host identity protocol</field><field name="subject">ipv6</field><field name="subject">mobility</field><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">personal networks</field><field name="subject">service composition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of high performance twist drill design and the associated predictive force models.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Qiang, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a detailed analysis of the plane rake faced drill design, its grinding method and grinding wheel geometry. A fundamental geometrical analysis has then been carried out on the major cutting edges of the modified drills according to the national and international standards. It has been shown that this new drill design results in a significant increase in the normal rake angle at lips as well as point relieving at the chisel edge region. Geometrical models for the various drill point features have been established which uniquely define the drill point features of the modified drill design.  A comprehensive experimental investigation has been carried out to study the drilling performance of the modified drills, when drilling a high tensile steel, ASSAB 4340, with TiN coated high speed steel drills over a wide range of drilling conditions. Comparing to the drilling performance with conventional twist drills under the corresponding conditions, it has been found that the modified drills can reduce the thrust force by as much as 46.9% with the average of 23.8%; the reduction of drilling torque is also significant at an average of 13.2% and the maximum of 24.9%. Similarly, the new drill design shows great superiorities over the conventional drills in terms of drill-life. In the drill-life tests, a few conventional drills were broken, but all plane rake faced drills performed very well.  In order to estimate the cutting performance in process planning on a mathematical and quantitative basis when drilling with the modified drills, predictive cutting force models have been developed based on the unified-generalized mechanics of cutting approach. The models have been assessed qualitatively and quantitatively and showed good agreements with the experimental thrust, torque and power. Empirical-type force equations have also been developed to provide simple alternatives for practical applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Twist drills.</field><field name="subject">Drilling.</field><field name="subject">Plane rake faced drills.</field><field name="subject">Drill-life.</field><field name="subject">Drilling force.</field><field name="subject">High tensile steels.</field><field name="subject">Predictive force models.</field><field name="subject">Drilling and boring machinery -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Drilling and boring machinery -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contact deformation of carbon coatings: mechanisms and coating design.</field><field name="creator">Singh, Rajnish Kumar, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of a study focussed on the elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for determining the structural integrity of carbon coatings on ductile substrates. Through elucidation of these mechanisms, two different coating systems are designed; a multilayered coating and a functionally graded coating. While concentrating upon carbon coatings, the findings of this study are applicable to a broad range of hard coatings on ductile substrates. The thesis concludes with a chapter outlining a brief study of the effects of gold coatings on silicon under contact load at moderate temperatures to complement the major part of the thesis. Carbon coatings with differing mechanical properties were deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), filtered assisted deposition (FAD) and magnetron sputtering deposition methods. Combinations of these techniques plus variation of deposition parameters enabled composite multilayered and functionally-graded coatings to also be deposited. Substrates were ductile metals; stainless steel and aluminium. Characterisation of the coating mechanical properties was undertaken using nanoindentation and nano-scratch tests. The same techniques were used to induce fracture within the coatings to allow subsequent analysis of the fracture mechanism. These were ascertained with the assistance of cross-sectional imaging of indents prepared using a focussed ion beam (FIB) mill and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using specimen preparation techniques also utilising the focussed ion beam mill. A two dimensional axisymmetric finite element model (FEM) was built of the coating systems using the commercial software package, ANSYS. Substrate elastic-plastic properties were ascertained by calibrating load-displacement curves on substrate materials with the finite element model results. Utilising the simulation of spherical indentation, the distribution of stresses and the locations for fracture initiation were ascertained using finite element models. This enabled determination of the influence such factors as substrate mechanical properties, residual stresses in the coatings and importantly the variation of elastic properties of the different coating materials. Based upon the studies of monolithic coatings, simulations were undertaken on multilayer and functionally-graded coatings to optimise design of these coating types. Based on the results of the modelling, multilayered and functionally graded coatings were then deposited and mechanical testing undertaken to confirm the models. Three major crack types were observed to occur as the result of the spherical nanoindentation on the coatings; ring, radial and lateral cracks. Ring cracks were found to initiate from the top surface of the film, usually at some distance from the edge of the spherical contact. Radial cracks usually initiated from the interface between the coating and the substrate directly under the symmetry axis of indentation and propagated outwards in a non symmetrical star-like fashion. Lateral cracks formed either between layers in the multilayer coatings or at the interface with substrate. Ring and radial cracks were found to form upon loading whereas lateral cracks formed upon both loading and unloading depending upon the crack driving mechanism. Pop-in events in the load displacement indentation curve were found to be indicative of the formation of ring cracks, while the formation of the other types of cracks was not signified by pop-ins but rather by variations in the slope of the curve. The substrate yield strength was found to influence the initiation of all crack systems while compressive stresses in the coating were seen to only influence the formation of ring and radial cracks. However, it was also noted that the initiation of one form of crack tended to then hinder the subsequent formation of others. In multilayer coatings, the lateral cracks were suppressed, as opposed to the monolayer coating system, but a ring crack was observed. This drawback in the multilayer system was successfully addressed by the design of a graded coating having the highest Young??s modulus at the middle of the film thickness. In this coating, due to the graded nature of the elastic modulus, the stresses at the deleterious locations (top surface and interface) were guided toward the middle of coating and hence increased the load bearing capabilities.  The effect of substrate roughness upon the subsequent surface roughness of the coating and also upon the fracture process of the coating during indentation was also investigated. For the coatings deposited on rough substrates, the radial cracks were observed to form initially and this eventfully delayed the initiation of ring cracks. Also the number of radial cracks observed at the interface was found to be proportional to the distribution of the interfacial asperities. In summary, the study elucidated the fracture mechanisms of monolayer, multilayer and graded carbon coatings on ductile substrates under uniaxial and sliding contact loading. The effects of the yield strength, surface roughness of the substrate, along with the residual stress and elastic modulus of the coatings on the fracture of coatings were investigated. The study utilised finite element modelling to explain the experiments observations and to design coating systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Nanoindentation</field><field name="subject">Coating</field><field name="subject">FIB</field><field name="subject">Fracture</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Finite element modelling</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Carbon composites</field><field name="subject">Protective coatings</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employers' experiences of shortages of skilled process workers in Suzhou industrial park, China.</field><field name="creator">Li, Yiqiong, School of Organization &amp; Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines and explains multinational employers' experiences of localized shortages of skilled process workers in Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), China.

In response to these challenges, SIP employers have adopted various HRM measures that include differing combination of recruitment and selection, employee retention, training and development, and employment relations management.

In the West, this program is sometimes referred to as 'Chinese Idol' because of its similarities to the globally popular television format, 'Idol'. Although 'Super Girls' shares many similarities with 'Idol'  there are also equally important differences. This thesis examines these differences as a way of theorising the how the program negotiates the localisation of a Western television format. First, the program is placed in the broader context of the increased liberalisation and commercialisation of the Chinese television industry. Secondly, the thesis analyses the concept of format television and presents the logic behind the global shift toward producing this type of programming. Next, specific aspects of Super Girls are analysed in detail to bring out how the program functioned culturally in the context of China. These aspects of Super Girls include, the way the program represents the changing role and potential of television from the PRC to contribute to negotiations on Chinese identity that take place among the various symbolic universes of Cultural China, including the global Chinese Diaspora. The thesis also explores the nature of the celebrities produced by the contest through isolating their meaning and significance within the Chinese context. The thesis argues that the contest winners are celebrated for their individuality and come to stand for the rise of 'ordinary power'. The thesis also examines the ways in which Super Girls embraces its audience through new modes of address and offering new types of agency for its audience. As a result, Super Girls offers insight into how Chinese culture is now shaped by a rise of 'ordinary empowerment' where the bottom-up cultures are hybridised with the traditional high culture in television broadcasting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Television broadcasting -- China.</field><field name="subject">Popular culture -- China.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum dots and radio-frequency electrometry in silicon.</field><field name="creator">Angus, Susan J., Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and demonstration of a new technique for the fabrication of well-defined quantum dots in a bulk silicon substrate, for potential applications such as quantum computation in coupled quantum dots. Hall characterisation was performed on double-gated mesaMetal-Oxide- Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, for the purpose of silicon quantum dots in etched nanowires on SOI. Carrier density and mobility results are presented, demonstrating top- and backgate control over the two inversion layers created at the upper and lower surfaces of the superficial silicon mesa. A new technique is developed enabling effective depletion gating of quantum dots in a bulk silicon substrate. A lower layer of aluminium gates is defined using electron beam lithography; the surface of these gates is oxidised using a plasma oxidation technique; and a further layer of aluminium gates is deposited. The lower gates form tunable tunnel barriers in the narrow inversion layer channel created by the upper MOSFET gate. The two layers of gates are electrically isolated by the localised layer of aluminium oxide. Low-temperature transport spectroscopy has been performed in both the many electron (&#8764;100 electrons) and the few electron (&#8764;10 electrons) regimes.Excited states in the bias spectroscopy provide evidence of quantum confinement. Preliminary temperature and magnetic field dependence data are presented. These results demonstrate that depletion gates are an effective technique for defining quantum dots in silicon. Furthermore, the demonstration of the first silicon radio-frequency single electron transistor is reported. The island is again defined by electrostatically tunable tunnel barriers in a narrow channel field effect transistor. Charge sensitivities of better than 10&#956;e/&#8730;Hz are demonstrated at MHz bandwidth.

For each user, the context contains the parameterizations for every component of the system. In addition, parts of a user???s context may be shared with other users, so that the actions of one user directly affect the look, feel and content of another user???s system, thereby giving new meaning to the term collaborative computing. The mapping server consists of a Web interface, the GMT mapping tools, a database and the Omega typesetting system. Instead of the components being directly attached to each other through point-to-point communication, they are brought together by the context. This approach provides much more flexbility, since new components and new parameters can be more easily added to the overall system, with little or no change to the components already present. The whole infrastructure is built using intensional programming, a form of programming in which software entities are considered to be intensions (in the logical sense), i.e. mappings from contexts to ordinary entities, called extensions. The thesis presents a comprehensive overview of the development of intensional programming, and highlights its relevance for current work in the areas of electronic documents and distributed software configuration management. The mapping server is the most significant intensional application to date: it contains the most number of lines of intensional code ever written with the biggest context space implemented in a real, working system. The thesis focuses on the parameterization of the Web interface, the mapping engine and the generation of correctly typeset labels for maps to create a parameter space that accurately describes these components, and how this parameter space as a whole can be browsed by a user independently or as a member of a collaborative group. This thesis is just the beginning of a new way to look at mapping and proves that focusing on the context allows the creation of powerful extensible software.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Full bibliographic is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of novel mast cell genes.</field><field name="creator">Sisavanh, Mary, Biotechnology &amp; biomolecular sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of microarray technology has provided an unprecedented wealth of data on gene expression in various tissue and cell types. Few studies have, however, taken full advantage of these data by selecting and then extensively characterising the functions of particular genes chosen from these microarray datasets. In this study, after analysing differentially-regulated genes revealed by microarray analysis of human mast cells activated via Fc??RI cross-linking, we chose two promising gene candidates for further research, A20 and Gem. Our group??s extensive gene expression database of major leukocytes showed that both A20 and Gem were up-regulated in other leukocyte types, and yet neither of these genes has been extensively explored in mast cells or in the immune system prior to our study. In order to investigate the first of these genes selected for further study, A20, we utilised both A20-deficient mast cells and mast cells in which A20 was over-expressed. Our findings establish for the first time that A20 is an important regulator of mast cell inflammatory responses to both LPS and Fc??RI cross-linking, and that it plays a novel role in mast cell proliferation. Our study of the second gene chosen for investigation, Gem, was conducted in a Gemdeficient mouse model developed by our group. In this study, we investigated the effect of Gem deficiency in two key immune cell types, macrophages and T-cells, complementing the work of a previous group member who investigated Gem deficiency in mast cells. Our results clearly exclude a role for Gem in macrophage and T-cell effector responses, and further establish that Gem is dispensable for in vivo inflammatory responses in models of delayed-type hypersensitivity and allergic airway inflammation. In addition to these findings, and given that the physiological role of Gem was not yet understood prior to our study, we extended our investigation to explore a potential function for Gem in the metabolic system. Using Gem-deficient mice, we found that Gem is necessary for insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. These findings confirm the potential for microarray expression data to reveal excellent gene candidates for further research and functional characterisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Mast cells</field><field name="subject">A20</field><field name="subject">Gem GTPase</field><field name="subject">Insulin secretion</field><field name="subject">Gene expression.</field><field name="subject">Microarray Analysis -- methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pre-coagulation of solid organs</field><field name="creator">Daniel, Steven A., School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Coagulation has and continues to be one of the most important elements in medicine.  Issues from a lack of hemostasis range from poorer clinical outcomes to sudden death.  The evolution of treatments for hemostasis have evolved from the use of Tamponade with direct pressure and bandages, the use of materials such as cobwebs and dust, the use of heat with hot oil or heated irons, to the use of suture, glues, plasmas, staplers, and electricity.  This evolution has continued to bring about the prophylactic use of technology in an effort to prevent blood loss.  This change from reactive treatments to proactive continue to be on a localized or superficial basis.  One of the largest opportunities to proactively reduce blood loss in surgical patients is during the resection of solid organs such as the liver, kidney, and spleen.  Few options have existed to help improve hemostasis short of the complete occlusion of blood supplying the tissue such as in the Pringle Maneuver.  Recent studies have begun to show that practices such as this may have a significant detrimental effect on morbidity.  It has been found that by applying radio frequency electrical energy in a particular way that large amounts of tissue can be pre-coagulated prior to resection.  A series of animal and human clinical work has been completed to help evolve and confirm the method and the device that was created and refined during this effort.  During the course of this work fifty-three patients were treated at four institutions on three continents.  Average blood loss for liver resections performed with this pre-coagulation technique using the developed device in a multicenter control trail was 3.35 ml/cm2 as compared to 6.09 ml/cm2 (p &lt; 0.05) for resections performed using standard surgical techniques alone.   Additionally, the transection time necessary was also reduced from mean value of 27 minutes (2 -- 219 minutes) to 35 minutes (5 -- 65 minutes).  Patients treated included those suffering from liver cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, and post chemotherapy fibrosis.      From this work the use of pre-coagulation with methods and device developed was shown to be safe and effective for reducing the amount of blood loss and transection time during liver resections.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coagulation.</field><field name="subject">Pre-coagulation.</field><field name="subject">Hemostasis.</field><field name="subject">Blood loss.</field><field name="subject">Blood coagulation tests.</field><field name="subject">Hemostasis, Surgical -- Methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing in the in-between: implications for early childhood education of new views on social relations.</field><field name="creator">?? Beckett, Cynthia June, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Social relations are commonly seen as exchanges between entities, a view implicitly indebted to Hegel?s account of the development of independent subjectivity. It is an analysis that explains many social interactions but that cannot explain key moments in social life. These moments occur in the non-Euclidean space and time of the in-between. This concept will be elucidated in this thesis through analysis of fieldwork examples and in relation to the work of Martin Buber and Donald Winnicott. The in-between arises when adults and children play together in the way described by Winnicott as playing in the third zone.  A phenomenological, interpretive analysis of forms of relations between parents and their two year old children revealed playing in the in-between during everyday family life. While the fieldwork focuses on families at home, the arguments are not restricted to this arena. It has implications for those working with young children, challenging the current emphasis on a task-oriented focus on teaching and learning.  A focus on social exchange creates early childhood programs that lack opportunities for being in the present moment in an unforced, un-knowing way. Such programs achieve set goals but may lack moments of infinite mutuality and tenderness such as those observed in the research. Relations cannot form when there is a continual focus on what is understood and known, on past  accomplishments and future objectives.  The in-between has three aspects; being fully present, un-knowing and mutuality through love. This analysis provides new views that will encourage opportunities for children and staff to be with one another in simple but profound moments of the in-between.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parent and child.</field><field name="subject">Child development.</field><field name="subject">Education -- Philosophy.</field><field name="subject">Education, Preschool.</field><field name="subject">Play -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Powerlines: alternative art and infrastructure in Indonesia in the 1990s.</field><field name="creator">Ingham, Susan Helen, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates why an alternative visual art and arts infrastructure developed in Indonesia during the 1990s. Initially alternative exhibition spaces developed in response to a lack of outlets through the existing commercial galleries and in reaction to the cultural hegemony of Suharto???s regime, which failed to provide infrastructure for modern art. ???Alternative??? will be extended here to describe an art and an arts infrastructure that became an influential system of power, the gatekeeper for the Indonesian arts community to the international art forum. The background of Alternative art is considered, its sources being in the protest of the New Art Movement, Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru, in the 1970s and an on-going art student rebellion against the modern and decorative art taught in the art academies. Contemporary artists sought content that reflected the many issues confronting Indonesian society, and rejected that art focusing on formal properties particularly in painting, which, by avoiding contention, served the purposes of Suharto???s regime. Particular examples are explored to define the lines of power that evolved: firstly the alternative gallery, Cemeti, and secondly the curator, Jim Supangkat and his theoretical justification for Indonesian contemporary art for the international forum. Finally the career structure of Heri Dono is examined to identify the mechanisms for artistic success through international contacts. This investigation concludes that power and influence became dependent on recognition in the international forum. Western and later Asian institutions, in selecting work for the high profile survey exhibitions proliferating in the 1990s, worked almost exclusively with this network. Their preference was for installation art that reflected the socio-political context in which it was made, and the few artists who were selected developed careers very different from their colleagues in Indonesia, some becoming nomadic art stars. This relationship between the Indonesian and the international art network has gained recognition for Indonesian contemporary art and an outlet for suppressed issues and marginalised people, but did not provide a fully balanced representation of Indonesian culture and reiterated the systems and paradigms of the West in relation to Asian art.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dono, Heri, 1960-.</field><field name="subject">Supangkat, Jim.</field><field name="subject">Cemeti Art House.</field><field name="subject">Art -- Indonesia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Injuries, emotions, and stories: Juror decision making and the tort of negligence.</field><field name="creator">Shanahan, Christopher Michael, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Within the framework of the Story Model of juror decision making, using an actual personal injury automobile accident case, this thesis investigated the influence of mock jurors??? emotional response to an injured plaintiff on decisions about defendant liability and the plaintiff???s contributory negligence as well as the efficacy of procedural legal safeguards to control any such biases. Study One validated the Story Model of juror decision making in individual decisions, and revealed that mock jurors failed to consider the requisite legal elements in rendering a verdict. Study Two ascertained participants??? affective response to a mock trial in which evidence relevant to liability was held constant and the severity of the plaintiff???s injuries differed. A multiple mediator model revealed that sympathy for the plaintiff and anger toward the defendant mediated the relation between injury severity and determinations of the relative culpability of the parties. Study Three demonstrated that mock jurors exposed to emotionally evocative damages evidence constructed stories about the defendant???s liability and the plaintiff???s contributory negligence that differed from those constructed in response to emotionally neutral evidence. Study Four showed that the process of group deliberation failed to correct the misuse of evidence relevant to damages in liability decisions. However, Study Five demonstrated that judicial admonitions both acknowledging mock jurors??? emotional response to the evidence and explaining why this response was irrelevant to judgments of liability moderated the influence of emotional states on decisions about liability and contributory negligence. Study Six indicated that jury-eligible citizens??? conceptions of negligence law closely matched the normative model of negligence law, and that their mental models of negligence cases that ended successfully for the plaintiff featured more severely injured plaintiffs than those that ended unsuccessfully for the plaintiff. These studies addressed analytical and methodological weaknesses in previous research, resolved conflicting findings on fusion of liability and damages, provided direct empirical support for the central premise of the Story Model of juror decision making, and advanced knowledge on the influence of emotion on decisions in civil legal cases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making.</field><field name="subject">Jurors.</field><field name="subject">Torts.</field><field name="subject">Negligence.</field><field name="subject">Injuries.</field><field name="subject">Emotion.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of Algal Epifauna to pulsed and chronic contamination of temperate Algal beds.</field><field name="creator">Roberts, David A, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contaminants may affect marine organisms through various pathways with impacts evident across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Organisms may encounter short pulsed exposures which contaminate surface waters for hours to days, or more persistent but patchy contamination of benthic habitats throughout their entire life-cycle. This thesis examines the responses of epifauna associated with macroalgae to a pulsed exposure of contaminants (storm-water input) and to chronic contamination via metal accumulation within temperate algal beds. The effects of storm water were monitored during a two-year survey of Sydney Harbour which sampled epifauna before and after heavy rainfall. Epifaunal assemblages declined throughout the harbour following storm events but for the most part these declines were not attributable to storm-water runoff. However, transient (&amp;lt 4 d) and localized impacts of storm water upon physico-chemical characteristics of recipient water and some epifaunal groups were identified around storm drains. A novel field dosing technique tested the relative importance of freshwater and associated metals as causative agents of behavioural avoidance and direct mortality responses. Strong avoidance of storm-water plumes was found which could be entirely explained by freshwater inundation, with no additional effects of metals. No direct mortality was observed following brief exposures. Contaminants introduced by storm water may accumulate within the tissues of macroalgae and potentially pose persistent threats to epifauna. Colonisation of epifauna was reduced on algae with enhanced copper levels, and the nesting behaviour, feeding and survival of an abundant amphipod were all negatively affected by copper load. Subsequent field surveys identified sufficient copper, lead and zinc contamination in Sydney Harbour algal beds to pose direct toxic threats to epifauna. The abundance of herbivorous amphipods correlated negatively with the copper content of a common algal species. However, differences in metal accumulation between algal species resulted in spatially variable levels of contamination. Small-scale patchiness of contaminants within these landscapes may allow populations of mobile species to persist if contaminated hosts are avoided. In summary, epifaunal assemblages appeared resilient to storm-water pulses. Recovery of affected groups was rapid and large fluctuations in abundance appear to be part of the natural flux of epifaunal communities. In contrast, assemblages responded strongly to algal-bound contaminants and this has emerged as an important pathway of contaminant exposure and impact within algal habitats.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Marine pollution</field><field name="subject">Water -- Pollution</field><field name="subject">Marine algae</field><field name="subject">Toxicity testing</field><field name="subject">Chronic toxicity testing</field><field name="subject">Copper -- Toxicity testing</field><field name="subject">Metals -- Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Individuals' responses to changes in risk: a person-specific analysis.</field><field name="creator">Schwartz, Carmit M, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we consider two comparative statics questions of changes in risk. The first question concerns situations where an individual faces some risk and has no control over the uncertain environment. In these situations we ask what kind of changes in risk will cause the individual's expected utility to increase. The second comparative statics question concerns situations where an individual faces some risk and has some control over the uncertain environment. In particular, we consider situations where the individual maximizes her expected utility with respect to some control parameter. Here we ask what kind of changes in risk will cause the individual's optimal value of the control parameter to increase.  The existing literature has answered these questions for a class of individuals (for example, the class of risk averse individuals). This thesis differs from existing literature as it focuses on a given individual, and thus reveals some of the person-specific factors that affect individual?s responses to changes in risk. The aim of the thesis is to show how an order on distributions, termed single crossing likelihood ratio (SCLR) order, can intuitively answer both questions for a given individual.  The main contributions of the thesis are as follows. First, the thesis presents the SCLR order and its main properties. Second, the thesis shows that the SCLR order can answer the above comparative statics questions in an intuitive way. In particular, the thesis shows that the answer to the above questions, with the use of the SCLR order, depends on a risk reference point which can be interpreted as a "certainty equivalent" point. Thus it is demonstrated that individual's responses to changes in risk are affected by her "certainty equivalent" point. Lastly, the results of the thesis can be used to provide an intuitive explanation of related existing results that were obtained for a class of individuals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risk assessment -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Risk management -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Risk -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Utility theory -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Decision making -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Statics and dynamics (Social sciences) -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Stochastic orders.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and verification of web services protocols.</field><field name="creator">Ramsokul, Pemadeep Kumar, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Among the plethora of solutions to the Business-to-Business interoperability problem, no other solution has obtained as much attention asWeb Services Technology (WST), which allows entities to exchange data regardless of their underlying platforms. WST also allows services to be composed in order to provide high quality customer service over the web.  In order to perform transactions across different service providers, standard protocols need to be supported by participating providers. Many useful protocols are coming into the market, but are often ambiguously specified by protocol designers and not fully verified. Furthermore, even if the specifications are reasonably clear, programmers often make subtle assumptions, possibly leading to errors that are hard to detect and locate, especially when the number of participating entities is dynamic. Consequently, these can lead to interoperability problems among implementations of the same protocol and high software maintenance costs.  To address these issues, a hierarchical automata-based framework is proposed to model the functional aspects of Web Services (WS) protocols that also assists in verifying their correctness. The modelling formalism has a sound mathematical foundation and aims to reconcile desirable features while still maintaining syntactic and semantic simplicity.  The properties to be verified are specified using a pattern system and/or 'observer' states, which have been adapted for WS protocols. In particular, always in a  positive observer state implies proper termination and partial functional correctness while reachability of a negative observer state signifies deadlock and/or violation of a safety property. Verification itself is handled by automatic translation of the model and its properties into a model-checker's input code and interpretation of the output produced by the model-checker.  A test-bed is proposed to check the conformance of a protocol implementation to its specification It helps in locating errors in the implementations of WS protocols especially where the number of participating entities is dynamic. Conformance checking is achieved by capturing sequences of exchanged messages of the actual implementations and checking them against the formal specification.  Experience using the framework is also described and illustrated using two non-trivial WS protocols, namely WS-BusinessActivity and WS-AtomicTransaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web services</field><field name="subject">Web services -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols -- Specifications</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Computer programs -- Verification</field><field name="subject">Electronic data interchange</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The benefits of services provided by externalaccountants to small and medium sized enterprises.</field><field name="creator">Carey, Peter John, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">While Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) constitute a significant segment of the Australian economy, and external accountants are their major service providers, little is known as to why SMEs purchase services from external accountants and what benefits they derive from those services. This thesis develops our understanding and investigates the benefits provided by external accountants, through auditing and business advisory services, to Australian SMEs. The relatively unregulated SME environment provides a unique opportunity to examine the market for professional services. SMEs, for example, can choose to be audited or not, and there is significant variation in the level of agency conflict they face. This thesis analyses data collected from two surveys of Australian SMEs. While theory suggests that auditing is a costeffective response to agency conflict, measures of this conflict are found to be associated with voluntary demand for external auditing, but not for internal auditing. Though the nature of the relationship between external and internal audit is unclear, a negative association is found between the two, suggesting substitution between these services. Whereas external audit is provided to reduce agency conflict, internal audit may be substituting for other services, unrelated to agency issues, such as providing useful information for decision making. I also investigate the economic benefit SMEs derive from auditing by measuring whether audited SMEs pay a lower interest rate on their major institutional borrowings compared with unaudited SMEs, or demonstrate superior performance. I find no evidence of a direct economic benefit on either of those measures. External accountants have responded to increasingly broad-ranging market information needs by providing an expanded range of business advisory services, and this thesis also investigates the relationship between external audit and business advice in the context of this changing market. Despite theory suggesting a complementary relationship, SMEs spend less on business advice when they also buy an audit, and this finding persists irrespective of agency considerations. The main purpose of business advice is to help improve firm performance, and SMEs buying business advice are found to perceive their business to be outperforming their competitors. This suggests a benefit associated with these services.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small business.</field><field name="subject">Accountants</field><field name="subject">Auditing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability and the struggle for hegemony in Australian architectural education.</field><field name="creator">Graham, Peter M., School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is situated within the contested fields of architectural education and sustainable development. It seeks to identify ideological positions within discourses related to these fields in order to explain documented resistance to the integration of sustainable design curricula in architectural education. To understand resistance to such integration we must go beyond identifying the problem. To affect curriculum change it is necessary not only to have a design for a desired state, but also to gain the power to implement it. This assumption demands both an understanding of the power relations that support the status quo and an acceptance of curriculum development as a process of ideological struggle. Hence, efforts to reform architectural education need to be informed by an understanding of the hegemonic struggles which shape architectural curricula. Existing research in the field of sustainable design education has not focussed on such issues. International studies have not considered curricula as manifestations of a history of ideological struggle. Nor have detailed studies of sustainable design education in schools of architecture been conducted in Australia. This study has addressed these knowledge gaps by investigating histories of ideas in architectural and sustainability education. A critical discourse analysis was conducted of the handbook descriptions of architectural courses in Sydney over the last thirty years, and of courses offered in 2007 by all Australian schools of architecture. This analysis was supported by curriculum mapping to reveal the power relations inherent in architectural curricula. The research has identified strategies of hegemonic struggle which affect the hegemony of ideologies in Australian architectural education and the positioning of sustainable design curricula within this contested field. I have found that sustainable design curricula are marginalised in Australian architecture courses and that this marginalisation has been historically constructed. I have also exposed hegemonic strategies that reproduce such marginalisation within curricula.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The payout phase of a defined contribution retirement income arrangement: the role of annuities.</field><field name="creator">Doyle, Suzanne, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the economic issues associated with the payout phase where a defined contribution (DC) retirement arrangement is adopted. In particular, the role of annuities in providing a retirement income is examined as well as insurance they provide against retirement risks such as inflation, longevity and rate of return volatility.  A comprehensive money&#146;s worth calculation based on a Australian population cohort mortality table shows that overall, Australian nominal and inflation indexed life annuities provide relatively good value for money. Although relative to annuities sold in the US and the UK they do suffer from relatively high adverse selection costs, which could in turn reduce demand. In addition, the presence of a government provided safety net pension could also result in low demand for annuities.  These two issues suggest that government intervention may be warranted to ensure retirees have access to affordable private insurance to protect their retirement benefit. This could take the form of mandating an annuity purchase at retirement. However, which annuity should be mandated is not well understood. This is an important question as there are many alternative annuity designs, each providing different degrees of retirement risk protection to an individual.  This thesis uses numerical simulations to empirically analyse the costs and benefits of mandating alternative annuities from both an individual and government&#146;s perspectives to determine optimal annuity design.  A model is used to estimate the value of payouts over time from various types of annuities across a range of retirement benefits. A means tested safety net pension is assumed to exist. Two stochastic variables &#151; inflation and the risky rate of return, are simultaneously used to show how the annuity payouts react to theses changes, highlighting the insurance features of various annuities.  Consumer preferences for the various annuities are estimated based on tolerance to risk. The variable annuity dominates the utility rankings under two conditions: -- when the relative risk aversion is low and a safety net payment isn&#146;t available, and when the relative risk aversion is high and a safety net payment is made. Otherwise the CPI indexed annuity has the highest ranking. Sensitivity analysis shows that the results presented here are robust to a number of alternative assumptions about the key variables.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Annuities.</field><field name="subject">Retirement income -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the synthesis of poly(co-maleic anhydride/iso-butyl vinyl ether)with RAFT polymerisation.</field><field name="creator">Lea, Santa Cinzia, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Poly (co iso-butyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride), an alternating copolymer, was synthesised. For this class of copolymers the formation of an electron-donor complex is invoked to explain their microstructure in which the two comonomers strictly alternate. Due to its polarity, this copolymer constitutes a potential additive for imparting hydrophilic properties to a hydrophobic matrix. In order to obtain narrow molecular weight polymers and study the relation between the molecular weight of this additive and its ability to migrate to the host polymer surface, chain transfer agents were introduced in the system and also the Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) process was employed. Free radical polymerisation was first carried out to allow for a comparison with the RAFT process and kinetics of copolymerisation was studied by NIR-FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to analyse the rate of reaction of each comonomer. Dibenzyl trithiobenzoate, 3-benzyl sulfanyl thiocarbonyl sulfanyl-propionic acid and dibenzyl trithiobenzoate were used as RAFT agents. Results demonstrate that only benzyl dithiobenzoate is able to control the molecular weight of this copolymer and decrease its polydispersity index; possible reasons laying behind this result are discussed. It was also found that, in particular in the presence of benzyl dithiobenzoate, poly(iso-butyl vinyl ether) forms. This is an unusual phenomenon considering that the free radical polymerisation affords alternating copolymers and that iso-butyl vinyl ether is a monomer that polymerises through the cationic process. Experiments were carried out in various solvents in an attempt to counteract this side reaction, but no appreciable correlation between the properties of the solvents and the formation of homopolymer were found. Various hypothesis are considered, however it is likely that, in the conditions adopted, the presence of the RAFT agents alters the equilibrium constant of complex formation favouring the synthesis of the homopolymer. In addition to this side???reaction also inhibition of the copolymerisation reaction was at times encountered and an investigation into this phenomenon was also conducted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RAFT</field><field name="subject">Poly (co iso-butyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride)</field><field name="subject">alternating copolymer.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computing order statistics over data streams.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Ying, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Statistics computation over data streams is often required by many applications, including processing of relational type queries, data mining and high speed network management. Among various s tatistics, order statistics computation is one of the most challenging, and is employed in many real applications, such as web ranking aggregation and log mining, sensor data analysis, trends and fleeting opportunities detection in stock markets and load balanced data partitioning for distributed computation. In this thesis, we investige three important problems in computing order statistics over data streams: 1. Computing rank queries over data streams with relative error guarantee. 2. Computing rank queries over data streams with duplication. 3. Computing top-k ranked queries on the sliding window. We first consider the problem of continuously maintaining order sketches over data streams with a relative rank error guarantee &#949;. Two space-efficient and onescan randomised algorithms are developed. And they are immediately applicable to approximately compute quantiles over data stream with relative error guarantee &#949; and significantly improve the space bound of previous work. In many real applications including data streams, data elements may be observed and recorded multiple times. Without uniqueness assumption on observed data elements, many conventional statistics computation problems need to be reinvestigated. To address the problem of order statistics computation against data streams with duplicate, we develop a novel, space-efficient one scan theoretical framework, based on an existing technique for counting distinct elements, to continuously maintain sketches so that rank-based queries can be approximately processed with a relative error guarantee &#949;. Moreover, we also propose two timeefficient algorithms. Finally, we study the problem of computing top-k ranked queries over the sliding window. Based on the observation that the K-Skyband of the elements is the minimal candidate set for the top-k ranked queries with arbitrary monotone preference functions where k &#8804; K, we develop novel algorithms to continuously maintain the K-Skyband over the sliding window. Efficient query algorithm is presented to support the massive top-k ranked queries in real time.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The I3A Framework: enhancing the sustainability of off-grid photovoltaic energy service delivery in Indonesia.</field><field name="creator">Retnanestri, Maria Immaculata Taufi, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the 1980s, approximately 10 MWp photovoltaic (PV) power has been installed in off-grid areas in Indonesia for powering lighting, water pumping, communications, health clinics, etc. However, PV energy systems (PVES) have yet to prove their sustainability and remain inaccessible to many remote Indonesian communities. The objective of this interdisciplinary thesis is to draw on social and engineering perspectives to address sustainability issues related to off-grid PVES delivery in Indonesia. By employing the Brundtland definition of sustainability, off-grid PVES delivery is analysed with respect to its institutional, financial, technical, social and ecological sustainability. In parallel, the thesis also investigates PVES Accessibility, Availability and Acceptability (3A), referring to the three energy goals proposed by the World Energy Council. The concepts of Sustainable Development, Social Capital, and Diffusion of Innovation are employed to examine the potential for off-grid PVES to contribute to improving the sustainability of remote Indonesian communities. The I3A (Implementation, 3A) Sustainable PVES Delivery framework is proposed to investigate PVES sustainability and the extent to which local communities can continue to socially innovate to meet their evolving needs beyond initial project completion. Sound project management (PM) is essential as off-grid PVES projects can only access limited resources (time, funds, and scope) and project failure can undermine a community???s capacity to innovate. The research methodologies include literature research, qualitative field research in villages where PVES has been installed and interviews with a wide range of PVES stakeholders in Indonesia. The I3A framework is tested against three off-grid PVES case studies from Lampung, West Java and NTT Provinces and is also proposed as a design tool. A key conclusion is that, to be sustainable and equitable, off-grid PVES projects should be implemented in an institutional framework that provides sound project management and addresses PVES accessibility (financial, institutional and technological), availability (technical quality and continuity) and acceptability (social and ecological). The overall objectives are to acknowledge the interests of all stakeholders, maximise equity, assure PVES continuity, and institutionalize PVES by utilizing and enhancing preexisting community resources to leave the community with the capacity to socially innovate. While this might be regarded as idealistic, enhanced local autonomy and capability will be essential in the context of the energy security and climate change challenges that humanity now faces.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power systems.</field><field name="subject">Project management.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crimes of exclusion: the Australian state???s responses to unauthorised migrants.</field><field name="creator">Grewcock, Michael, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a criminological perspective on the Australian state???s responses to unauthorised migrants. In particular, it attempts to build on recent criminological literature on state crime by contrasting the alleged deviance of unauthorised migrants with the organised and deviant human rights abuses perpetrated by the Australian state. The main argument of the thesis is that through the systematic alienation, criminalisation and abuse of unauthorised migrants, particularly refugees, the Australian state is engaged in state crime. While this can partly be measured by breaches of international humanitarian law, the acts in question are criminal according to the broader sociological understanding of state crime as ???state organisational deviance involving the violation of human rights???. The thesis develops this argument by locating the phenomena of forced and illicit migration within an increasingly globalised world economy in which the needs for international human migration are confronted by the restrictive migration policies of the dominant Western states. In this context, the Australian state has played a pivotal role in the development of three major Western exclusion zones, which are designed to contain unauthorised migrants in the developing world and are enforced by measures that systematically abuse human rights. The fundamental criminological dynamic of the Australian exclusion zone is its systematic assault on the movements and by definition, the rights, of forced migrants. This operates at a number of levels: unauthorised arrivals are alienated by their lack of legal status; they are denied access to a full refugee determination process; their status as refugees is subordinated to that of the resettled refugee; their experiences are denied and delegitimised through their construction as queue jumpers; they are criminalised through their participation in smuggling enterprises; they are punished and abused through the use of detention, dispersal and forced removal; and they are put at greater personal risk by the measures employed to enforce the zone. The thesis traces the development of this zone from the formation of the white Australia policy through to the Pacific Solution and critically analyses the ways in which current policy draws on and reinforces the exclusionist traditions of Australian nationalism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugees -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Forced migration.</field><field name="subject">Human rights.</field><field name="subject">Humanitarian law.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A software system for radionuclide dosimetry with applications.</field><field name="creator">McKay, Erin, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Radiation dosimetry is necessary for optimising radiation-based medical procedures for individual patients but in the field of nuclear medicine there are few widely available or widely used tools for performing this kind of analysis. Those tools that are available tend to focus on one particular component of the dosimetry problem and integrating tools to form a complete system is left to the end-user.  A software system for performing individual, image-based dosimetry analysis of nuclear medicine studies has been developed and validated. The system consists of a suite of tools that use common file formats and data models. The tools can be integrated to form applications by means of a simple scripting system. One tool is a gamma camera simulator that can produce realistic images of dynamic activity distributions in planar or tomographic formats. Simulated imaging studies produced by this tool are used to validate the other tools in the system. In addition, the system implements a method of simulation assisted quantitation which is shown to achieve high accuracy in both software and physical phantom studies.  The system is applied to the dosimetry of I-131 Lipiodol, a therapeutic agent used to treat primary and secondary cancers of the liver. Simulation studies are used to validate the analytic methods used. Studies of a series of patients, treated over a period 10 years, are retrospectively analysed using a selection of methods appropriate to the available data.  The results of the analysis demonstrated a large range of lung doses from 1 to 10 Gy/GBq administered. The median absorbed dose in liver was 3 Gy (range 1 - 10 Gy) and the median absorbed dose in tumor was 19 Gy (range 5 - 84 Gy). The large individual variation reinforces the necessity of individualised dosimetry for treatment planning and follow up.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiation dosimetry.</field><field name="subject">Radioisotope scanning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sing at the Moon: the contextual narrative of isolation and grief in Australian women???s writing.</field><field name="creator">Hill, Barbara, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">???Sing at the Moon: the contextual narrative of isolation and grief in Australia women???s writing??? comprises two complementary elements of a single thesis: a novel and a critical essay. My novel takes as its starting point the impact of unsolved murders on small regional communities and uses this to explore the effects of isolation and grief on subjectivities, particularly women???s. The novel represents an original contribution to that strand of contemporary Australian fiction, especially as written by women, which deals with the Australian bush myth and the effects on women of the masculinism of Australian national identity. The critical component of my thesis examines Thea Astley???s Drylands and Dorothy Hewett???s Neap Tide in terms of how each novel engages with Australian literary traditions and offers an explicit critique of Australian masculinist culture. I focus on the ways the novels represent violence against women and show how this violence works to underpin the masculinist myth of mateship - to reveal a more sinister underbelly of Australian culture. Their critique of Australian masculinist culture also works at the level of form where both writers subvert a traditional ???realist??? form for political as well as aesthetic purposes. I see myself primarily as a writer and feminist who uses theory and criticism as a way of reflecting on my own creative practice in the light of writing as social responsibility. My approach both to my own novel and to Drylands and Neap Tide is shaped by Susan Lever???s proposal that ???writing and reading lie at the heart of feminism; they are the means by which women can explore and communicate the deepest aspects of their condition??? (2000,132). In my essay I am interested in providing a critical context for the novel by exploring feminist theories of subjectivity and the ways these can be represented in fiction. As a result I will analyse some of the narrative conventions employed in Hewett???s and Astley???s novels. I will show that the work of both writers operates in the context of an Australian literary tradition ??? both past and present ??? and informs and negotiates new ways that accommodate feminist concerns with fictional practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of alternative idea generation techniques in audit  fraud risk assessments.</field><field name="creator">Khalifa, Amna Saeed, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent international regulatory reforms have put more responsibility on auditors for detecting financial statement fraud. The recent changes to international auditing standards make it compulsory for members of the audit team to discuss the susceptibility of an entity to fraudulent misstatements at the audit planning stage. These standards do not stipulate the format of these group discussions, nor provide any explicit guidelines on how to carry out effective discussions. This dissertation reports on two studies that examine different discussion techniques which could lead to a better identification of audit fraud risks at the audit planning stage, and may in turn help in fraud detection. Study One tests whether two enhanced forms of interacting group processes (brainstorming guidelines and premortem instructions) have advantages over an interacting group (without brainstorming guidelines). The brainstorming group is provided with Osborn???s (1957) original brainstorming guidelines. Premortem is a variation of the mental simulation idea developed by Klein (1999) invoking a scenario where participants actively search for a flaw in their plans. The auditors in both the brainstorming group treatment and the premortem group treatment generated a larger number of potential frauds than the interacting group treatment. These results were robust across a range of dependent variables used to measure quantity and quality of fraud items. The results also show that more premortem groups listed rare frauds compared to the other two group structures. There was a negative relationship between the number of items listed and the assessed likelihood of fraud. Participants who estimated a higher likelihood of fraud provided a more complete mental simulation of how a fraud could be perpetrated. Study Two focuses on the individual brainstorming phase which may occur before the group brainstorming session. It examines whether giving additional brainstorming guidelines and task decomposing (in addition to the original brainstorming guidelines), improve performance compared to having only the original brainstorming guidelines. Both the additional brainstorming guidelines and the task decomposition treatments generated a larger number of potential frauds than the brainstorming guidelines treatment. Task decomposition helps participants focus equally on all task subcategories leading to a more diverse set of ideas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risk assessment.</field><field name="subject">Auditing -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Auditing -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security market design &amp; execution cost.</field><field name="creator">Cook, Rowan M, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">We employ the Reuters database to compare execution costs for 2,330 matched-pair securities across the top 7 equity markets in the Dow Jones STOXX Global 1800 Index. This sample encompasses a wide variety of thirteen market design features. In addition, we investigate execution costs well beyond the most heavily traded stocks to include equities in the sixth through tenth deciles of traded value. Our findings indicate that full transparency of the limit order book to investors and a composite of unique NYSE features (but not the presence of the crowd) unequivocally reduce effective spreads. In contrast, a fully transparent limit order book revealed to brokers, the presence of a market maker, or the mixture of execution systems present on the LSE sharply increase effective spreads in both thickly and thinly-traded stocks. The effect of a physical trading floor is statistically significant but relatively small; it increases effective spreads slightly for thickly-traded firms, and reduces them for thinly-traded stocks. The findings for price impact are the same with three exceptions. First, the presence of a trading floor increases costs, dramatically so for thinlytraded stocks. Second, a fully transparent limit order book for brokers raises price impact for thickly traded stocks, but lowers price impacts for thinly traded firms. Third, in thinly-traded stocks, London???s hybrid market decreases price impact, and in thickly-traded stocks, crowd trading on the NYSE and full transparency to investors decrease price impact. Finally, the results for realised spread are essentially the same as those for effective spread, with the exception that the effect of the presence of a trading floor is to reduce realised spreads. Overall, the London Stock Exchange is the highest execution cost market, and the NYSE is the lowest. This research includes a market-specific study of the effect on execution cost of the Liquidity Provider of Euronext Paris. Euronext Paris affords a natural experimental research design because a third of firms have Liquidity Providers and two thirds do not. Results indicate quoted spreads, effective spreads and realized spreads are significantly affected by the presence of a Liquidity Provider, but price impacts are not. On the one hand, this suggests that the thickly-traded stocks where the Liquidity Providers are prohibited have sufficient liquidity in their absence. On the other hand however, liquidity providers on Euronext Paris reduce effective and realised spreads in essentially all stocks. This finding suggests that the limit order book refreshes much more quickly after developing an imbalance of large size orders when Liquidity Providers can facilitate other liquidity suppliers in assessing picking off risk. The Liquidity Provider increases quoted spreads for thickly-traded firms from the first three traded value deciles while reducing quoted spreads for the lower deciles.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cost.</field><field name="subject">Stock exchange.</field><field name="subject">Markets.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking the politics of distribution: the geographies and governmentalities of housing assistance in rural New South Wales, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Dufty, Rae, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Housing, while a necessity of ???life???, goes beyond this definition in this research to also become a technology of government in the domestic distributional geopolitics of nation-states. Employing a Foucaultian approach to power and governance, this research examines how the provision of housing assistance was used in the government of rural public housing communities. Data for this research were collected through a series of archival resources that focused specifically on the transitional periods of 1935-1955 and 1985-2005. Data were also gathered through a questionnaire and interviews with public housing tenants and staff from four towns (Griffith, Cootamundra, Junee and Tumut) in the ???Riverina??? region of south-western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This research makes five contributions to geographical understandings of distributional politics. First, the thesis contends that poststructuralist theoretical approaches to the analysis of power and governance enable innovative critical engagements with the distributional geopolitical agendas of governmental processes. The research also found that the distributional geopolitical agendas of Governments have been pursued through more than just the redistribution of fiscal resources, but also include the redistribution of human resources. In particular, housing assistance has been, and is used today, to perpetuate certain internal migration patterns to aid this human-distributional agenda. Third, the study argues that ??? while the broad shift to advanced liberal forms of government have resulted in changes to how distributional geopolitical agendas are pursued ??? ???distribution??? remains an integral feature of the geopolitical objectives of those who seek to govern in advanced liberal ways. This work also shows how these new advanced liberal distributional objectives remain open to being problematised and/or resisted at the local scale. However, while such governmental processes are always uncertain and open to contestation, these changes have brought about a new set of ethical and political consequences. We need to be alert to and critical of the ways in which these new distributional geopolitical agendas impact on our own and others??? ???freedoms???.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing assistance.</field><field name="subject">Public housing.</field><field name="subject">Rural.</field><field name="subject">Regional.</field><field name="subject">Governmentality.</field><field name="subject">Power.</field><field name="subject">Distribution.</field><field name="subject">Regional development.</field><field name="subject">New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Rural areas -- Planning -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Geopolitics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the counterculture on Australian cinema in the mid to late 20th century.</field><field name="creator">Hooton, Fiona, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the impact of the counterculture on Australian cinema in the late 20thcentury through the work of the Sydney Underground Film group, Ubu. This group, active between 1965 -1970, was a significant part of an underground counter culture, to which many young Australians subscribed. As a group, Ubu was more than a rat bag assemblage of University students. It was an antipodean aspect of an ongoing artistic and political movement that began with the European avant-garde at the beginning of the 20th century and that radically transformed artistic conventions in theatre, painting, literature, photography and film.  Three purposes underpin this thesis: firstly to track the art historical links between a European avant-garde heritage and Ubu. Experimental film is a genre that is informed by cross art form interrelations between theatre, painting, literature, photography and film and the major modernist aesthetic philosophies of the last century. Ubu's revolutionary aesthetic approaches included political resistance and the involvement of audiences in the production of art. Their creative wellspring drew from: Alfred Jarry, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Fluxus, Conceptual and Pop art. This cross fertilization between the arts is critical to understanding not only the Australian experimental movement but the history of contemporary image making.  The second purpose is to fill a current void of research about early Australian Experimental film. This is a significant gap given it was a national movement with many international connections. The counterculture movement also contains many major figures in Australian art history. These individuals played their parts in the Sydney Push, Oz magazine and the activities of the Yellow House and have since become important multi arts practitioners and commentators.  Thirdly, the thesis attempts to evaluate Ubu's political and social agenda for the democratization of film appreciation through their objectives of: production, exhibition, distribution and debate of experimental film both nationally and internationally. Ultimately the group would succeed in these objectives and in winning the war on repressive censorship laws. Their influence has informed the practice of many of Australia's current film heavy weights.  Two key films have been selected for analysis, It Droppeth as the Gentle Rain (1963) and Newsfront (1978). The first looks forward to Ubu's contemporary practices and political agenda while the second demonstrates their longer term influences on mainstream cinema.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ubu Films -- History.</field><field name="subject">Experimental films -- New South Wales -- Sydney -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Counterculture -- New South Wales -- Sydney -- History.</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="subject">Motion picture industry -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social reconstruction learning: Using philosophy for children &amp; John Dewey to overcome problematic dualisms in education and philosophy.</field><field name="creator">Bleazby, Jennifer, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many of the problems in dominant Western education and philosophy can be connected to various dualisms, in particular reason/emotion, reason/imagination, reason/experience, mind/body, subject/object, individual/community, abstract/concrete, theory/practice and male/female dualisms. These pairs are considered opposites, with the attributes on the left supposedly superior to their dualistic partners on the right. While those attributes on the left, such as mind and reason, are traditionally associated with knowledge, autonomy, citizenship and learning, the attributes on the right, such as emotion and experience, are traditionally thought to be opposed to knowledge, autonomy, citizenship and learning. Drawing on the philosophies of John Dewey and various feminist philosophers, I will argue that the attributes that make up each of these dualistic pairs are not opposed but are actually interdependent and interconnected. For example, I will argue that all thinking and learning involves reason, experience, emotion and imagination interacting with one and other. Neither of these attributes or functions is complete or fully functional without the others. Since mainstream Western pedagogies incorporate such dualisms they are unable to fully facilitate the thinking skills, attributes, dispositions and understandings necessary for autonomy, democratic citizenship and leading a meaningful life. It will be shown that Philosophy for Children (P4C) has the potential to overcome many of the problems with mainstream education, including many gender equity problems, because it is based on Dewey???s philosophical ideals, which reconstruct many of these dualisms. An analysis of the ideals of truth, meaning, community, self, autonomy, democracy, thinking, emotion and imagination assumed by P4C will show how it reconstructs various dualisms and overcomes many problems with traditional schooling. However, it will also be shown that P4C fails to reconstruct the undesirable theory/practice dualism because it doesn???t require students to test and apply their ideas in the real world. This is even though many P4C theorists, such as Matthew Lipman, accept Dewey???s claim that all thinking and learning involve such practicality. Thus, I will reconstruct the P4C pedagogy by integrating it with a Deweyian type of service learning that I call social reconstruction learning. Social reconstruction learning involves students engaging in P4C style communities of inquiry with members of their community in order to reconstruct real social problems. Such a Practical P4C pedagogy can better facilitate reflective thinking, autonomy, active citizenship and meaningfulness.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dewey, John, 1859-1952 -- Democracy and education.</field><field name="subject">Dualism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Costs and consequences: understanding the impact of fostering on carers.</field><field name="creator">McHugh, Marilyn, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on a study examining the direct and indirect costs to volunteer carers of providing a fostering service in Australia. The study highlights the current difficulties in carer recruitment and retention, the increases in the challenging and complex needs of the children coming into care, and the growing professionalism of fostering. The study uses a budgetary approach to estimate the direct costs of fostered children. In-depth interviews and focus groups with carers are instrumental in providing a range of perspectives that assist our understanding of how the direct costs of fostered children are different from (higher than) the costs of other children. The study found the costs of fostered children were 40 per cent higher than the costs of children not in care. The thesis indicates that, to maintain and retain a volunteer workforce, an adequate carer remuneration system to meet the direct costs of fostered children is critical. To examine the indirect costs of fostering, the study uses a multi-method approach providing a monetary value of the opportunity costs (foregone earnings model) and time costs (proxy good or market replacement model) for foster carers. The emotional and psychological dimensions of fostering are also examined, though no monetary value is assigned to these costs. Carers??? vivid and contrasting stories from the interviews explain how ???money??? fits with carer motivation and fostering???s more professional role, how carers perceive the nature of fostering (job or parenting), and whether carers should be paid to foster. Revelations of fostering???s emotional and time dimensions and restricted employment opportunities (indirect costs) highlight the impact fostering has on carers and their families. The study found that the indirect costs of fostered children were around four times the value of the direct costs. In light of the growing professionalism of contemporary foster care, difficulties in carer recruitment/retention, and the demanding nature of fostering, the thesis examines whether carers should be paid for the service they provide (compensation for indirect costs). Using a number of theoretical concepts developed by feminist economists and social theorists on paying for caring labour, the thesis found support for the contention that altruism (???love???) and carer pay (???money???) are not incompatible, and ambiguities and tensions for foster mothers around money and love can be resolved. Studies of countries where carers receive a wage component as part of their remuneration package provide insights into wage levels, perceived adequacy of the wage, and the impact of wages on carer recruitment/retention. The study found that, due to the profoundly gendered nature of fostering, the compensatory aspects of remuneration (fee/wage or salary) are generally poor. The implications for government welfare spending of paying Australian carers are discussed, and the savings to governments of using a volunteer workforce are demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foster children.</field><field name="subject">Volunteers.</field><field name="subject">Cost.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge???s value: internalism and externalism.</field><field name="creator">Balderson, Shannon, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages with epistemology???s value problem. That is, is knowledge epistemically preferable to true belief? If so, how is that the case? The issue under discussion is whether epistemic justification can account for a value discrepancy between true belief and knowledge. First of all, the contours of the justificatory landscape are presented???in particular, the division between externalist and internalist styles. The thesis then considers whether solely truth-directed justification (which includes externalism) can possibly account for a value unique to knowledge. The preliminary conclusion is that solely truth-directed justification cannot solve the value problem. A discussion of internalism then ensues. The discussion does not focus explicitly on which benefits internalism may offer in terms of value; instead, the focus is on whether internalism qua internalism can solve the value problem. It is concluded that, if internalism is the sole provider of the value of knowledge (above that of true belief), then epistemology must forgo the belief that knowledge is preferable to a Gettiered belief. I do not accept such a concession; therefore, I reject the thesis that internalism exclusively solves the value problem. Throughout the thesis, the importance of externalism to epistemology becomes apparent. This feature invites a reconsideration of the value of externalism (in particular, of reliabilism). The thesis closes by reconsidering the value of reliabilism and concludes that the value problem can be solved, but only by an appeal to externalist justification.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge, Theory of.</field><field name="subject">Internalism (Theory of knowledge)</field><field name="subject">Justification (Theory of knowledge)</field><field name="subject">Externalism (Philosophy of mind)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Bury, burn or dump???: black humour in the late twentieth century.</field><field name="creator">Murray, Kristen A, School of Media, Theatre &amp; Film &amp; School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">In humour studies research, there have been few attempts to elucidate why black humour was such a prevalent, powerful force in late twentieth century culture and why it continues to make a profound impression in the new millennium. As Dana Polan (1991) laments: ???Rarely have there been attempts to offer material, historically specific explanations of particular manifestations of the comic???.1 This thesis offers an interdisciplinary analysis of black humour in the late twentieth century. I contend that the experience of black humour emerges from the intricacies of human beliefs and behaviours surrounding death and through the diverse rituals that shape experiences of loss. I suggest that black humour is an attempt to articulate the tension between the haunting absence and disturbing presence of death in contemporary society. Chapter 1 of this thesis offers an historical and etymological perspective on black humour. In Chapter 2, I argue that the increasing privatisation and medicalisation of death, along with the overt mediatisation of death, creates a problematic juxtaposition. I contend that these unique social conditions created, and continue to foster, an ideal environment for the creation and proliferation of black humour. In Chapters 3 and 4, I examine the structures and functions of black humour through three key theories of humour: incongruity, catharsis and superiority. Chapter 5 looks at ways in which the experience of black humour creates resolutions and forces dissonances for people entwined with loss. In this final chapter, I also consider how black humour may help people make meaning from issues surrounding death. Throughout this theoretical discussion, I interweave the analysis of a range of scenes from contemporary black comic texts (i.e. plays, screenplays and television scripts). On the whole, this thesis works towards a more complex, specific understanding of the phenomenon of black humour within a social context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Black humour.</field><field name="subject">Black comedy.</field><field name="subject">Gallows humour.</field><field name="subject">Dark comedy.</field><field name="subject">Humour studies.</field><field name="subject">Incongruity theory.</field><field name="subject">Catharsis theory.</field><field name="subject">Superiority theory.</field><field name="subject">Death.</field><field name="subject">Dying.</field><field name="subject">Grief.</field><field name="subject">Coping mechanism.</field><field name="subject">Media violence.</field><field name="subject">Theatre.</field><field name="subject">Film.</field><field name="subject">Television.</field><field name="subject">Sociology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct shear behaviour of steel fibres in a cementitious matrix.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Gregory G, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation into the direct shear behaviour of steel fibre reinforced composites utilising discrete fibres at pre-defined angles and fibres randomly distributed is described. The direct shear tests encompassed the complete range of loading from its initial application to failure of the double L-shaped push-off specimens. Hooked-ended and straight steel fibres were used in the tests with the fibres oriented at angles of ??75??, ??60??, ??45??, ??30??, ??15?? and 0?? with respect to a plane normal to the loading direction. The embedment lengths of the fibres, related to the total fibre length lf , each side of the shear plane were 0.5lf :0.5lf and 0.25lf :0.75lf . In addition to the single fibre tests, tests were conducted on randomly oriented steel fibre reinforced composites with fibre volumes of 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, and 0.020 with hooked-ended and straight steel fibres.  In addition to the tests outlined above, a series of non-destructive tests employing radiographic techniques was carried out to produce photographic images of events taking place of fibres pulling out from a cementitious element. The tests consisted of hooked-ended steel fibres oriented at angles of -60??, -30??, 0??, +30?? and +60?? to the cracking plane and straight fibres oriented at angles of -60??, 0?? and +60??. The non destructive technique allowed the internal behaviour occurring within the specimen along the shear plane to be investigated without impacting on the direct shear tests.  The angle of the fibre to the interface plane is an important parameter in determining the behaviour of the fibres under load and for the mode of failure; viz fibre pullout or fibre fracture. The effect of the end hook on behavioural aspects becomes increasingly less significant for more acute fibre angles where bending and snubbing effects become increasingly influential on the load versus displacement behaviour and mode of failure.  Contrary to expectations, the fibre embedment length had little influence over the peak loads attained for the discrete fibre tests and, in a number of specimens, fibres pulled out from the longer embedded side. This observation is contrary to the generally accepted assumption that a fibre remains rigidly embedded on the long side and pulls out from short side. The traditional role that uniform bond stresses along a fibre length and friction have played in the description of fibre behaviour is not as significant as previously reported, other effects such as snubbing are more important in anchoring a fibre. Various models need to be revised with this observation in mind.  The experimental results and observations from the discrete hooked-ended and straight steel fibres investigation are incorporated in the development of a behavioural model, the Variable Engagement Model II (VEMII). The VEMII describes the behaviour of randomly oriented discontinuous steel fibre reinforced composites loaded in shear. The model is verified against a series of randomly distributed fibre reinforced mortar specimens carried out in this study. Two forms of models are analysed: 1) a model based on the observation of lumped shear stresses at the fibre hook and in the snubbing zone; and 2) a uniform fibre bond stress applied along the embedded part of the fibre. The lumped bond stress approach and the uniform approach were found to give reasonable comparisons with the test data for the hooked-ended fibres but were conservative for the straight fibres. The VEMII confirms the applicability of the uniform bond approach adopted by previous researchers even though it does not correspond to the observations of fibre pullout behaviour of single fibres. The VEMII model provides a versatile approach that can also be applied to hybrid fibre combinations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Fibers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employers and industrial relations in the Australian meat processing industry: An historical analysis.</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Patrick John, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Some industrial relations researchers have considered the meat processing industry as one of the more strike-prone industries in Australia. Many researchers have analysed this industry from either a political economy perspective or a union industrial relations perspective. This thesis acknowledges this body of literature, but takes as its focus the ways that employers have shaped the industry?s industrial relations. Employers, far from being reactive or even passive actors in shaping the industry?s industrial relations, have taken a long-term active role in this area. This thesis, therefore, focuses on an historical analysis of the changing roles of employers and employer associations in the industry?s industrial relations. This thesis will identify and link the relevant theoretical literature to the historical narrative, and then link this to actual events through three case studies analysing three exemplar employers. The findings of this thesis are that employers have had and made strategic choices about the industry?s industrial relations, at the workplace, industry and national-levels. The rise of AMH, which forms much of the second half of the narrative and analysis, shaped the industry?s industrial relations in ways not seen before in the Australian meat processing industry. Thus, the strategic choices on by many medium and larger meat-industry employers at the time, proved ineffective in the face of AMH?s success in driving down the cost of the wage-effort bargain, rendering many uncompetitive on both the input and output sides of the product market.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meat industry</field><field name="subject">employers</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">strategic choice</field><field name="subject">Meat industry and trade -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internal oxidation in iron and nickel base alloys.</field><field name="creator">Burg, Michelle L, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The internal oxidation behaviour of Ni-base and Fe-base alloys containing approximately 5 at% Al and both with and without low concentration Cr additions in flowing low-oxygen atmospheres at 1273 K was studied. There were two groups of Febase alloys; ferritic alloys that were Fe-Al-Cr and others that also contained approximately 9.3 at% Ni in order to make them austenitic. Ni?base alloys were oxidised in oxygen partial pressures of either 4.6 ?? 10-11 atm or 9.8 ?? 10-13 atm and Febase alloys were oxidised in an oxygen partial pressure of 1.2 ?? 10-16 atm  The aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of internal oxidation on Fe- and Ni-base alloys containing Al or Al with Cr. The morphology of the precipitates formed and rates of reaction were of interest. Oxidation of the ferritic Fe-base alloys produced internal oxidation only at lower solute concentrations. In these alloys steady state diffusion-controlled precipitation was prevented from occurring due to the formation of an oxide barrier at the reaction front, and cracking off of the internal oxidation zone. In all of the austenitic alloys (Ni-base and y-Fe-base) internal oxidation was observed after all exposures. In y-Fe-base alloys and in Ni-base alloys oxidised at the higher oxygen partial pressure (4.6 ?? 10-11 atm) precipitation zones were found to widen according to parabolic kinetics, indicating diffusion control. In Ni-base alloys oxidised at 9.8 ?? 10-13 atm, precipitation zones were observed to widen according to parabolic kinetics up to 40.9 hours. However, the rate slowed for longer reaction times due to coalescence of precipitates at the reaction front. The rate of internal oxidation decreased with increasing Cr, and thus total solute, concentration. The parabolic rate constants measured for internal oxidation were higher than predicted by Wagner's theory of internal oxidation, which is consistent with observations in previous studies. Kinetics were accelerated by the presence of elongated precipitates, aligned approximately normal to the alloy surface. Chromium alloy additions led to precipitate coarsening, and at lower oxygen partial pressures, to loss of elongated morphology. The precipitates formed were found to be a mixture of M2O3 and AM2O4, where M represents either Al or Cr, and A represents either Fe or Ni. Both oxide forms were detected at all depths within the internal oxidation zone. However, Cr-containing oxides were limited to the part of the internal oxidation zone closer to the alloy surface, while Al-containing oxides were present at all depths. This is consistent with thermodynamic predictions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nickel alloys.</field><field name="subject">Iron alloys.</field><field name="subject">Oxidation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soundfield analysis and synthesis: recording, reproduction and compression.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Shuai, School of Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunication, UNSW</field><field name="description">Globally, the ever increasing consumer interest in multichannel audio is a major factor driving the research intent in soundfield reconstruction and compression. The popularity of the well commercialized 5.1 surround sound system and its 6-Channel audio has been strongly supported by the advent of powerful storage medium, DVD, as well as the use of efficient telecommunication techniques. However, this popularity has also revealed potential problems in the development of soundfield systems. Firstly, currently available soundfield systems have rather poor compatibility with irregular speaker arrangements. Secondly, bandwidth requirement is dramatically increased for multichannel audio representation with good temporal and spatial fidelity. This master???s thesis addresses these two major issues in soundfield systems. It introduces a new approach to analyze and sysnthesize soundfield, and compares this approach with currently popular systems. To facilitate this comparison, the behavior of soundfield has been reviewed from both physical and psychoacoustic perspectives, along with an extensive study of past and present soundfield systems and multichannel audio compression algorithms.

Porosity Research seeks to classify spaces which exist deep within the skin or fabric of privately owned city buildings. The primary vehicle for this interrogation is the use of public art in the form of a set of games called Porosity Games ??? Snakes and Ladders, Hide and Seek and Jenga. These games are played out or performed within the territory of my Australian Research Foundation Discovery Grant outcomes. Their aim is to prove the validity of the research and to provoke interrogation of that research. The marginality of public art makes it ideally suited to the task of commenting on or contradicting the main body of the text of public space in the city. This contradiction is central to the work of this thesis.  One of the vital needs or reasons for this work lies in finding ways of preventing cities from being shut down as a result of rampant capitalism in the ???Age of Terror???. Porosity as a strategy attacks this trend. It seeks the dissolution of architecture through a type of mapping which dissolves existing boundaries associated with rights of access. Capitalism needs to be continually measured by mapping or defining what is public against what is private. It can be argued that the social construction of a city is as important as its physical manifestation as buildings. It can also then be argued that a city which allows public space to penetrate its private space enables a healthier social construction.  Fundamental to this thesis is the idea that the survival of the Western city depends on an increased density of public space and multiple ground planes as opposed to one. This creates three dimensional public access and alleviates congestion at the level of the street both for cars and for pedestrians.  The Porosity Games are a first step in the transformation of the city through their successful reinvention of internal circulation spaces as game space.

Differentiating between officially sanctioned, symbolic, and everyday monuments, this thesis theorises the narratological space composed by these objects: static, imagined and transitional, respectively. It argues that monumental sites are spaces of forgetting, rather than remembering, characterised through invisibility, opacity and mystification. Infused with paradox, monuments simultaneously reveal and conceal the histories and urban memories they are expected to commemorate. The discussion then turns to contemporary art, in particular memory installations, as a practice that counters the mystification inherent within urban space, actively exposing alternative pasts and memories. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first analyses the contemporary, officially sanctioned monuments of Vilnius, Lithuania that celebrate an ancient nationalism, alongside two neighboring sculpture parks that display retired Soviet icons, with a particular focus on Gintaris Karosas?? sculpture Infotree LNK. The second chapter theorises symbolic monuments, and focuses on the Japanese theme park Tobu World Square as a curiosity cabinet where the contemporary spatial practice, identified by Anthony Giddens, of ??disembedding?? is performed in miniature. It concludes with a discussion of Susan Norrie??s DVD installation of the park ENOLA. The third chapter examines everyday monuments, focusing on the industrial ruins of Manchester to unravel the archival aspects of these monuments and their gentrification. It closes with a study of Cornelia Parker??s installation Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View. Through these urban case studies and accompanying memory installations, the thesis explores how urban monuments disguise certain histories and memories of a city, and how art can reclaim alternative stories and memories from urban amnesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Packing of particles during softening and melting process.</field><field name="creator">Zheng, Xiao-Qin, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Softening deformation of iron ore in the form of sinter, pellet, and lump ore in the cohesive zone of an ironmaking blast furnace is an important phenomenon that has a significant effect on gas permeability and consequently blast furnace production efficiency. The macroscopic softening deformation behavior of the bed and the microscopic deformation behavior of the individual particles in the packed bed are investigated in this study using wax balls to simulate the fused layer behavior of the cohesive zone. The effects of softening temperature, load pressure, and bed composition (mono - single melting particles, including pure or blend particles vs binary ??? two different melting point particles) on softening deformation are examined. The principal findings of this study are: 1. At low softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure increases the deformation rate almost linearly. 2. At higher softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure dramatically increases the deformation rate, and after a certain time there is no more significant change in deformation rate. 3. The bed deformation rate of a mono bed is much greater than that of a binary one. 4. In a binary system, the softening deformation rate increases almost proportionally with the increase in the amount of lower melting point wax balls. 5. In a mono system with blend particles, the content of the lower melting point material has a more significant effect on overall bed deformation than the higher melting point one. 6. The macro softening deformation of the bed behaves the theory of creep deformation. 7. A mathematical model for predicting bed porosity change due to softening deformation based on creep deformation theory has been developed. 8. Increase in load pressure also reduces the peak contact face number of the distribution curves, and this is more prominent with higher porosity values. 9. The contribution of contact face number to bed porosity reduction is more pronounced in a mono system than in a binary system. 10. The porosity reduction in a binary bed is more due to the contact face area increase, presumably of the lower melting point particles. 11. The mono system has a single peak contact face number distribution pattern while the binary system exhibits a bimodal distribution pattern once the higher melting point material starts to deform. 12. In a binary system, an increase in deformation condition severity tends to reduce the contact face number of the higher melting point material without having to increase the contact face number of the lower melting point material accordingly to achieve a given porosity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Softening.</field><field name="subject">Creep mechanism.</field><field name="subject">Particle packing.</field><field name="subject">Particles.</field><field name="subject">Deformations (Mechanics) -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functionalization of carbon nanotubes.</field><field name="creator">Liu, Rongmei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to investigate methods for purification and modification of Single Wall and Multi Wall Carbon Nanotubes. Covalent and noncovalent approaches to functionalization were studied. The dispersibility, structure and electronic properties of modified tubes were characterized by Raman, UV-vis-NIR and XPS. Fluorescence, NMR and TEM were further employed to characterize the interaction between nanotubes and non-covalent modifiers. The effects of five different purification methods on the dispersibility, and degree of carboxylic acid functionality of SWCNTs, along with the level of defects on the tube side walls, and the resulting electronic properties of SWCNTs have been investigated. It was found that all oxidation treatments successfully removed metallic oxides and amorphous carbon impurities, while different oxidation treatments introduced different levels of oxidized sites on the SWCNTs. Heat treatment after oxidation eliminated some of the carboxylic groups introduced by oxidation. SWCNTs covalently functionalized by aromatic diazonium salts containing nitro, carboxylate and fluoro groups on the aromatic ring were prepared. Heating of these tubes in vacuum at 350_C for 5 h partially reversed the effects of functionalization. However, due to the low degree of functionalization achieved in the preliminary studies, the dispersibility/solubility of functionalized tubes did not greatly improve. The interaction in stable suspensions of CNTs with positively or negatively charged pyrene derivatives via noncovalent functionalization, was extensively studied. 1-pyrene methylamine hydrochloride gave most stable dispersions. 1H and 2H NMR spectroscopy of MWCNTs/1-pyrene methylamine hydrochloride dispersion in DMF-d7 showed that the broadened signals are associated with weakly or unbound pyrene, while strongly bound pyrene is not observable in solution-state NMR. The strong pyrene attachment on MWCNTs by &#960;-&#960; stacking can be reversed by dialysis and/or extensive washing. Biological molecules such as polypeptides and amino acids also dispersed MWCNTs into solvents by noncovalent modification. It is found that polytryptophan demonstrated the greatest ability to disperse MWCNTs. Digestion with chymotrypsin enabled polytryptophan binding to be reversed. A combination of tube cutting and non-covalent functionalization by pyrenes or peptides enables tubes to be suspended/dissolved in solvents such as DMF and ethanol, and significantly allows tubes to be manipulated for practical device applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Nanotubes</field><field name="subject">Nanostructure materials</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autonomic dysreflexia following high level spinal cord injury: time course, mechanisms and possible intervention.</field><field name="creator">Laird, Angela S, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Following cervical or upper thoracic level spinal cord injury (SCI), motor, sensory and autonomic systems are disrupted. One form of this autonomic dysfunction is the condition autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which is characterised by episodes of high blood pressure in response to afferent input from regions below the injury level. An animal model of autonomic dysreflexia, the T4 transected rat, was used in this thesis to gain insight into the cardiovascular and temperature components of the disorder, possible peripheral mechanisms and interventions to prevent its development. Chapter 2 of the thesis includes the charaterisation of a T4 transection rat model of spinal cord injury. This characterisation includes confirmation of decreased baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP, 71 down from 117 mmHg) and elevated heart rate (HR, 431 bpm from 366 bpm) for 6 weeks post injury (p.i.). Documentation of the development of AD found that hypertensive responses were fully developed (+20 mmHg) by 4 weeks p.i. Further, during episodes of AD at Weeks 4 and 5 p.i., tail surface temperatures decreased significantly (mid-tail, -1.7oC), indicative of extensive vasoconstriction. Comparison of vascular responses of intact and SCI animals to adrenergic agonists (phenylephrine, PHE and methoxamine, METH) following ganglionic blockade in vivo found that SCI animals experienced prolonged vasoconstriction in blood vessels above and below injury level in response to PHE but not METH. Possible mechanisms of this change included decreased neuronal reuptake of PHE (METH is not a substrate for neuronal reuptake). The presence of prolonged vasoconstriction in blood vessels throughout the body, not just regions below injury level, suggests a widespread mechanism for the change, such as the decreased basal MAP, norepinephrine levels or neural activity present following injury. Thus, it was hypothesised that increased activity from an early stage post injury may prevent the peripheral adaptation and perhaps hinder development of AD. For this, the common rehabilitation technique, treadmill training, was used. Surprisingly, rather than preventing AD, the training actually accelerated its development, producing exaggerated hypertensive responses to colorectal distension (CRD) at Weeks 3 and 4 post-injury (Week 4, Trained: +38.5 ?? 1.5 mmHg; Sedentary: 23.4 ?? 3.1mmHg). Comparison of vascular responses of both groups to PHE injection found no significant difference indicating that the enhanced responses were not a result of peripheral vascular changes. Investigation of the central morphology following SCI, made via immunohistochemical processing of the post-mortem spinal cords, found that Treadmill Trained SCI animals had elevated calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity within lamina III/IV of lumbar segments, compared to intact cords. It is possible that this finding indicates afferent sprouting that may have accelerated the development of AD in Treadmill Trained animals. The results within this thesis highlight the importance of awareness and examination of autonomic function in SCI patients, especially those undergoing rehabilitative training.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spinal cord.</field><field name="subject">Injuries.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of novel molecular markers from the WNT pathway : a stepwise regression model for pancreatic cancer survival.</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Amanda Caroline, St Vincent???s Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Optimisation of the conventional tripartite of pancreatic cancer (PC) treatment have led to significant improvements in mortality, however further knowledge of the underlying molecular processes is still required. Transcript profiling of mRNA expression of over 44K genes with microarray technology demonstrated upregulation of secreted frizzled related protein 4 (sFRP4) and  ??-catenin in PC compared to normal pancreata. Their pathway ??? Wnt signalling is integral to transcriptional regulation and aberrations in these molecules are critical in the development of many human malignancies. Immunohistochemistry protocols were evaluated by two independent blinded examiners for antigen expression differences associated with survival patterns in 140 patients with biopsy verified PC and a subset of 23 normal pancreata with substantial observer agreement (kappa value 0.6-0.8). A retrospective cohort was identified from 6 Sydney hospitals between 1972-2003 and archival formalin fixed tissue was collected together with clinicopathological data. Three manual stepwise regression models were fitted for overall, disease-specific and relapse-free survival to determine the value of significant prognostic variables in risk stratification. The models were fitted in a logical order using a careful strategy with step by step interpretation of the results. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased sFRP4 membranous expression (&amp;gt 10%) in 49/95 PC specimens and this correlated with improved overall survival (HR:0.99;95%CI:0.97-6.40;LRchi2=134.75; 1df; ??&amp;lt 0.001). Increased sFRP4 cytoplasmic staining (&amp;gt  2/3) in 46/85 patients increased the disease-specific survival  (HR:0.52;95%CI:0.31-0.89;LR test statistic =248.40;1df;??&amp;lt 0.001). Increasing ??-catenin membranous expression (&amp;lt _60%) in 26/116 patients was associated with an increased risk of overall death (HR:3.18;95%CI:1.14-8.89;LR test statistic =4.61;1df,??&amp;lt 0.05). Increasing cytoplasmic expression in 65/114 patients was protective and was associated with prolonged survival on univariate, but not multivariate analysis (Disease specific survival HR:0.75;95%CI:0.56-1.00;logrank chi2=3.91;1df; ??=0.05). Increased nuclear ??-catenin expression in 65/114 patients was associated with prolonged survival (disease-specific HR:0.92;95%CI:0.83-1.02; LR test statistic= 49.72;1df;??&amp;lt 0.001). At the conclusion, 12 patients (8.6%) remained alive, 122 died of their disease (68 males versus 54 females). They were followed for a median of 8.7 months (range 1.0-131.3) months. The median age was 66.5 years (range 34.4-96.0, standard deviation 10.9) years. Pancreatic resection was achieved in 79 patients with 46.8% achieving RO resection. The 30 day post-operative mortality was 2.1%. The overall 1 year survival rate was (33.7% ; 95%CI: 25.78-33.79) with a 5 year survival of (2.87%, 95%CI: 2.83-6.01) and a median survival of (8.90 months; 95%CI: 7.5-10.2). The median disease-specific survival was (9.40; 95%CI: 7.9-10.5 months) and the median time to relapse was 1.2 months (95%CI 1.0-1.2 months). A central tenet of contemporary cancer research is that an understanding of the genetic and molecular abnormalities that accompany the development and progression of cancer is critical to further advances in diagnosis, treatment and eventual prevention. High throughput tissue microarrays were used to study expression of two novel tumour markers in a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients and identified sFRP4 and ??-catenin as potential novel prognostic markers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pancreas -- Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Pancreatitis.</field><field name="subject">Wnt proteins.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extraction and characterisation of pectin from Australian and Indonesian sweet potato.</field><field name="creator">Nurdjanah, Siti, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Starch residue samples from two Australian sweet potato varieties (Beauregard and Northern Star) and two Indonesian sweet potato varieties (Bis192 and Bis183), and commercial sample of sweet potato starch residue, were studied for their pectins. Pectins were extracted using 0.1M HCl, 0.05M NaOH, 0.1M HCl/0.75%SHMP, and 0.05M NaOH/0.75% SHMP. Hydrolysis of residual starch in the cell wall of sweet potato using heat stable &#945;-amylase and amyloglucosidase was employed prior to pectin extraction to eliminate starch contamination. Pectins were characterised for yield, moisture, ash, galacturonic acid content (GA), degree of esterification (DE), neutral sugars content and molecular weight (MW). Selected pectins were also characterised for their dispersion and gel properties. Pectin with the highest yield was compared to commercial low methoxyl pectin (GRINSTED??YF 450) for its application in milk pudding. The pectin characteristics are dependent on variety and extraction process; however, the extraction methods were dominant. Yields were between 7 and 30 % of the cell wall. Ash varied from 2.9 to 6.8%. NaOH/SHMP extraction gave higher yields and ash contents. Moisture was between 5.5 and 6.7. GA varied from 27 to 80% with the highest found in Bis192 extracted using NaOH/SHMP. DE varied between traceable and 57%. HCl extraction gave higher DE, while NaOH/SHMP caused demethylation. Neutral sugars varied from 10 to 25% where galactose was the predominant sugar, followed by arabinose, rhamnose, glucose and xylose. Pectin MW was very heterogeneous. HCl extraction gave higher MW than the others. Dispersion of sweet potato pectins displayed shear-thinning. Consistency coefficient (K) increased, while flow behaviour index (n) decreased with increasing pectin concentration. HCl-extracted pectins formed stiff sugar-gels at concentrations higher than 2%. The optimum Ca2+ concentration for NaOH/SHMP-extracted pectin gels was 20 mg/g pectin. Pectin with the highest yield and stiffness (Norther Star extracted using NaOH containing SHMP) was used for milk pudding preparation. This pudding had comparable texture to pudding prepared from commercial low methoxyl citrus pectin (GRINSTED??YF 450). Overall, this study demonstrated that pectin from sweet potato starch residue is mainly low methoxyl pectin with possible chemical structure of rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI) that has potential for food applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pectin</field><field name="subject">Extraction (Chemistry)</field><field name="subject">Sweet potatoes -- Autralia</field><field name="subject">Sweet potatoes -- Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and modelling of membrane heat exchanger in HVAC energy recovery systems.</field><field name="creator">Nasif, Mohammad Shakir, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The performance of membrane heat exchangers for HVAC total energy recovery systems was evaluated through experimentation and detailed system modelling. The operating principle of the membrane heat exchanger (enthalpy heat exchanger) is based on passing ambient hot and humid supply air over one side of a porous membrane heat exchanger surface and cold and less humid room exhaust air on the other side of the transfer surface. Due to the gradient in temperature and vapour pressure, both heat and moisture are transferred across the membrane surface causing a decrease in temperature and humidity of the supply air before it enters the evaporator unit of the conventional air conditioner. Hence both sensible and latent energy are recovered. In this study, both experimental and numerical investigations were undertaken and mathematical models were developed to predict the performance of the latent heat recovery heat exchangers for use with conventional air conditioning systems. The membrane moisture transfer resistance was determined by a laboratory-scale permeability measurements. It was found that the membrane heat exchanger performance is significantly influenced by the heat exchanger flow profile and shape, heat and moisture transfer material characteristics, air velocity and air moisture content. Improvement of membrane heat exchanger performance requires an in depth study on flow, temperature and moisture distribution in the heat exchanger flow paths. Thus, a commercial CFD package FLUENT is used to model the membrane heat exchanger. However, software of this type cannot model moisture diffusion through the porous transfer boundary. Therefore, two user defined function codes have been introduced to model the moisture transfer in latent energy heat exchangers. The annual energy consumption of an air conditioner coupled with a membrane heat exchanger is also studied and compared with a conventional air conditioning cycle using the HPRate software. Energy analysis shows that in hot and humid climates where the latent load is high, an air conditioning system coupled with a membrane heat exchanger consumes less energy than a conventional air conditioning system. The membrane heat exchanger dehumidifies the air before it enters the air conditioning system, resulting in a decrease in energy consumption in comparison with conventional air conditioning system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat exchangers</field><field name="subject">Heat recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable natural resources policy and management in relation to water diversions with special reference to the south-to-north water transfer project in China.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Ji, Graduate Research Program in Environmental Policy &amp; Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">China has undertaken a vast engineering project: the large-scale transfer of water from the south of the country to the north, the intention being to alleviate flooding in the south and water shortages in the north. It may take up to fifty years to complete. This thesis examines the broad outline of the scheme, the planning that has gone into it, its historical and political background, and the political, social, and ecological problems that it has encountered and may be likely to cause in the future. The political context of a 'pro-technology' policy amongst today's Chinese leaders is highlighted. The Chinese study is made in the light of water-transfer schemes that have been implemented, or proposed, in other countries; and also ideas about sustainable development, policy processes, and natural resource management.  Five case studies are considered: the Aral Sea (Central Asia), the Snowy Mountain Scheme (Australia), the National Hydrological Plan (Spain), the Central Arizona Project (the United States) and the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (China). They are examined as a basis for understanding policy problems and processes in water resource management, and also to make some suggestions for their resolution in the Chinese case&#8213;though finding a permanent or definitive solution lies beyond the scope of the present inquiry.  The difficulties for traditional policy processes to manage uncertainty and complexity are particularly acute in the area of natural resource management. For example, climate change issues challenge present water management systems and diversion projects. Therefore, uncertainty and complexity issues, beyond the 'ideal' policy cycle, are considered, particularly in relation to climate change, but also the water diversion schemes themselves.

At the same time, there are many employees who, despite being exposed to frequent and persistent bullying in the workplace do not label themselves bullied. This thesis investigated a number of behavioural, individual and contextual variables that were predicted to have an influence on the perceived severity of workplace bullying behaviours and the actual labelling of the behaviours as bullying using established workplace bullying measures and vignettes. Overall, the results indicated that the perceived severity and labelling of workplace bullying behaviours were influenced by the behaviours involved, by characteristics of the employee being subjected to the behaviours, by characteristics of the employee perpetrating the behaviours and by the connection that the target???s co-workers had to the bullying interaction. Specifically, the analyses indicated that behaviours that personally ridiculed the target were perceived as severe and as bullying more frequently than other categories of bullying behaviour. Participant gender and current experience with workplace bullying were also revealed to be predictive of whether negative workplace behaviours were perceived as severe and bullying in nature. The formal position held by the perpetrator relative to the target was revealed to influence whether the behaviours were perceived as severe. The formal position of the perpetrator, the presence of others during the bullying act and the knowledge that others in the workplace were also being targeted significantly influenced whether the behaviours were labelled as bullying in nature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bullying in the workplace.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vascular risk factors and brain structure in healthy middle-aged adults: a series of studies using high resolution MRI</field><field name="creator">Chen, Xiaohua, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">A number of chronic disease and behavioural factors are recognised to increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. These putative ???vascular??? risk factors have increasingly been recognised to increase the risk of cognitive impairment in the absence of clinically manifest ischemic events. Their relationship to structural brain changes has received limited attention.  In this dissertation, I used high resolution magnetic resonance image (MRI) to examine two structural features of the brain, regional gray matter (GM) volumes and silent lacunar infarcts, and determined their association with vascular risk factors.  I related these to cognitive function in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The work was based on the data of three waves in two healthy cohorts drawn from the PATH Through Life Study, which is a population-based longitudinal study of ageing comprising 3 cohorts aged 20-24, 40-44, and 60-64 years, with about 2500 participants in each cohort. Random subsamples of Wave 1 of the cohort aged 60-64 years (N = 478) and Wave 2 of the 40+ cohort (aged 44-48 years) (N = 411) were examined cross-sectionally for the MRI sub-study. The MRI cohort aged 60-64 years was re-examined 4 years later in Wave 2. These studies showed that vascular risk factors are associated with lower regional GM volumes and this association varies at different ages. In adults aged 44-48 years, individual risk factors did not show a significant relationship with GM volumes, but the Framingham risk score was associated with less GM volumes in a number of brain regions, suggesting an additive effect of the risk factors. In the 60+ cohort, hypertension was independently associated with less regional GM volumes in bilateral medial frontal, right superior frontal, left superior temporal and precentral gyri. The same cohort, when examined in Wave 2, showed the negative association of hypertension with gray matter volumes to be more widespread. These associations were observed in men but not in women in either wave. Sex dimorphism was observed in the younger cohort as well, with greater GM volumes in temporal and occipital cortices, midbrain and cerebellum in men, while less GM volumes in cingulate and parietal cortices in comparison with women. Lacunar infarcts were present in 7.8 % of the 60+ cohort, and asymptomatic new lacunar lesions developed in 0.4 % per year in this group. The prevalence of lacunar infarcts was correlated with hypertension and a steeper decline in mental speed. These series of studies indicate the relationship of vascular risk factors with changes in brain structure and cognitive function in healthy middle-aged adults. It is suggested that modifying these vascular risk factors may protect the brain from silent lesions and cognitive impairment, and that intervention should begin early in life to have a major impact.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vascular risk factors.</field><field name="subject">Brain.</field><field name="subject">Magnetic resonance imaging.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular diseases.</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease.</field><field name="subject">Middle aged persons.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of asymmetric signalling pathways on the mouse heart development.</field><field name="creator">Furtado, Milena Bastos, St. Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of death in the first year of life, the estimated incidence being 0.5-5% of live births; therefore it is important to understand the genetic causes underlying the complex process of heart formation to help prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of affected patients. CHD is the commonest phenotype associated with left-right (LR) disorders. LR asymmetry is determined during embryonic development. The three major body axes ? antero-posterior, dorso-ventral and left-right ? are patterned at gastrulation. LR asymmetry is established shortly after the two other major axes are patterned. The process of LR determination can be sub-divided into four integrated steps: 1. breaking of molecular symmetry in the gastrulation organizer; 2. transfer or relay of this asymmetric information to the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), from which most internal organs will be formed; 3. reinforcement and propagation of asymmetric cues throughout the LPM and 4. conversion of asymmetric molecular information into proper organ morphogenesis.  The goal of this work is to investigate mechanisms involved at two specific points in the laterality pathway: the initial generation/maintenance of asymmetric gene expression in the LPM and the morphogenetic translation of these early events into correct heart formation in the mouse. My emphasis has been on the characterization of laterality targeted cells via careful analysis of Pitx2c expression using a Pitx2c-lacZ reporter transgene, the role of BMP signalling, via Smad1, in generation/maintenance of early asymmetric signalling in the LPM, and the later involvement of both Smad1 and Pitx2 in cardiac morphogenesis through analyses of knockout mice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="subject">heart</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Nodal</field><field name="subject">Pitx2</field><field name="subject">Congenital heart disease</field><field name="subject">Mice as laboratory animals</field><field name="subject">Morphogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiotherapy in cancer care: estimating the optimal utilization from a review of evidence-based clinical guidelines.</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Geoffrey, South-west Sydney Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Radiotherapy utilization rates for cancer vary widely internationally. It has previously been suggested that approximately 50% of all cancer patients should receive radiation. However, this estimate was not evidence-based. The aim of this study was to estimate the ideal proportion of new cases of cancer that should receive radiotherapy at least once during the course of their illness based on the best available evidence.  Materials and Methods: An optimal radiotherapy utilization tree was constructed for each cancer based upon indications for radiotherapy taken from evidence-based treatment guidelines. The proportion of patients with clinical attributes that indicated a possible benefit from radiotherapy was obtained by adding epidemiological data to the radiotherapy utilization tree. The optimal proportion of patients with cancer that should receive radiotherapy was then calculated using TreeAge software. Sensitivity analyses using univariate analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed.  Results: The proportion of patients with cancer in whom external beam radiotherapy is indicated according to the best available evidence was calculated to be 52%. Monte Carlo analysis indicated that the 95% confidence limits were from 51.7% to 53.1%. The tightness of the confidence interval suggests that the overall estimate is robust. Comparison with actual radiotherapy utilization data suggests a shortfall in actual radiotherapy delivery.  Conclusion: This methodology allows comparison of optimal rates with actual rates to identify areas where improvements in the evidence-based use of radiotherapy can be made. It provides valuable data for radiotherapy service planning.

I use my own experience of growing up in Italian and Anglo Australian cultures as a primary source to examine the changing nature of memory affects and to consider they ways in which events of the past have formed and transformed my cultural identity. I also explore the intermingling of personal and collective memory and how ethnic groups negotiate community identity within national identity formations. Concepts of Deleuze and Guattari, particularly those of the rhizome, the refrain and territorialisation, are keys to understanding practices associated with memory and identity and I apply them throughout the thesis. Nostalgia and loss are emotions often tangled up with memory and identity and I use the work of Barthes, Stewart and Woodward in discussing these. I use other diverse theories to look at the ways memory is embedded in the body ?? manifested in gestures, performance and everyday practices ?? and mediated in rituals, film, photographs, documents and objects. The style of writing does not adhere to the conventions of academic discourse and diverts intermittently from scholarly argumentation. It assembles disparate memory events ?? both personal and collective ?? along with factual information, fragments of biography and autobiography, and reflection and analysis. It is written this way in part to resemble the process of thinking and remembering which is never a smooth, logically flowing stream of intelligence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The other basic aspect of reality.</field><field name="creator">Floth, Simon, History and Philosophy, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is argued that physical (and not inherently psychical) properties are insufficient to constitute all else.  Specifically they cannot constitute an instance (K1) of our knowledge that the number of existing things is at least one.   This employs a new version of entry by entailment:  Every fact as to the presence of a constituted trope is entailed by facts about the presence of the ontologically basic, where a property is ontologically basic if and only if the fact of its presence is not entailed (even allowing exhaustive definitions of all tropes in terms of their ultimate constituents) by facts about the presence of things non-identical to it. Existence is a mind-independent presence.  Things can be present (to mind) as opposed to existing but must be accompanied by the presence of all of their parts and of anything else that their presence might entail.  This includes some existing thing in the case that knowledge that something exists is present, since it is analytic that knowledge cannot be of what is not the case. Purely dynamical properties cannot exist apart from instances of some other property kind (on pain of regress as to what moves).  Material properties can make a difference to cognitive states only in virtue of differences they can make to dynamical properties.  Thus, any cognitive state present in some dynamical and material scenario must be present in an equivalent purely dynamical scenario, which cannot exist. Hence:  1) There can be no knowledge of existence, or thus trope K1, in a purely dynamical scenario.  2) There can thus neither be a trope K1 if only dynamical and material properties (and what they constitute) are present.  So because there is a trope K1, there are one or more ontologically basic properties which are not dynamical or material.  It is further argued that nothing ontologically basic is per se (directly and non-obscurely) conceivable except as psychicality or a categorical basis of a disposition to change or constancy (respectively, dynamism and materiality).   Thus at least one ontologically basic property is either psychical or not per se conceivable.  The latter proposition has less merit.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consciousness.</field><field name="subject">Qualia.</field><field name="subject">Metaphysics.</field><field name="subject">Mind.</field><field name="subject">Psychoanalysis.</field><field name="subject">Reality.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyurethane/carbon nanotube composites for biomedical applications.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Charles, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Carbon nanotube (CNT) polymer composites have attracted much attention since the extraordinary electrical and mechanical properties of CNTs were realised. However research into biomedical applications of CNT/polymer composites has received little attention. The aim of this thesis was to fabricate an electrically conductive, biocompatible polymer based on a poly(ether)urethane (PEU) with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) as the conductive filler. Paramount to achieving this was to obtain good dispersion and integration of MWNTs within the host polymer matrix. A number of different strategies were investigated including high energy mixing of MWNTs in PEU and covalent functionalisation of MWNTs with long chain hydrocarbons, poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO) and poly(acrylic acid) (pAA) for enhanced miscibility with PEU. The impact of these strategies was assessed by testing the tensile properties, electrical conductivity as well as cytotoxicity of resulting MWNT/PEU composites. It was found that high energy mixing in the presence of MWNTs caused severe degradation of PEU, resulting in significant cytotoxicity and reductions in composite tensile strength. Covalent functionalisation of MWNTs was achieved by utilising defect group chemistry to attach a range of molecules. PTMO covalently attached to MWNTs was found to cause significant nanotube aggregation in PEU composites. Long chain hydrocarbons covalently attached to MWNTs exhibited enhanced dispersability in PEU with increasing molecular weight, attributed to disrupting intertube Van der Waals forces and providing favourable hydrophobic interactions with PEU. Additionally these composites exhibited increased conductivity and decreased cytotoxicity with increasing hydrocarbon length. However increasing long chain hydrocarbon molecular weight also caused significant reductions in MWNT conductivity. MWNTs surface modified with carboxylic acid groups exhibited favourable hydrophilic interactions with PEU but did not retain tensile properties at nanotube loadings where electrical conductivity was significant. Successful polymerisation of acrylic acid monomer initiated from MWNTs using a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerisation was demonstrated. Resulting pAA-MWNTs exhibited enhanced dispersability in water but not in PEU composites, resulting in severe degradation in composite tensile properties. PAA-MWNTs also exhibited decreased conductivity with increasing pAA molecular weight. Incorporating MWNTs in PEU composites has been demonstrated to impart multi-functionality to existing biomaterials for potential uses in a range of biomedical applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-modal experience in music and visual art: their correspondences and a new perspective of appreciation in education.</field><field name="creator">Chu, Kalaly, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract  The originality and significance of this research is to use a?cross-modal? perspective to experience the ?multi-dimensional? nature of the arts, specifically in the area of music and the visual arts. This research will focus on investigating common cross-disciplinary attributes and apply them in the realm of ?appreciation? in aesthetic education in music and visual art. 	The three major research problems and issues in this dissertation are as follows: (1) What are the common elements in music and the visual arts? (2) Do people make correspondences between music and painting by using the work of painters and musicians? (3) How do we define the role of music and its adaptability in linking with other expressive forms in contemporary education? Ultimately, the entire dissertation serves to redefine the ?value? and uniqueness of the arts (music and visual art) in the holistic development of an individual, in particularly in moulding and enhancing the skills of personal and cultural expression.  	The aims in this research are taken from various angles which correspond with the questions about ?interdisciplinary study? and the ideas of ?changing teaching and learning? in the 21st century. Interdisciplinary Studies has been a term which has provoked a great deal of controversy in current educational development, particularly in Asian countries, and especially in music education. The originality of this research lies in three areas. First, a cross-modal perspective is used to explore the common elements in music and visual art, especially in the dimensions of ?brightness?, ?intensity? and ?line?. Second, a cross-modal perspective in music will be adopted. Instead of focusing on the melody, harmony and form of music repertoire, sensory qualities, such as ?brightness?, ?intensity? and ?line? will be used as musical vocabulary to interpret cross-modal perception in experiencing the arts. Third, this dissertation will investigate the art experience, especially the thinking and cognitive appraisal in viewing the arts, of the creators and the spectators.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">visual arts</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron correlations in mesoscopic systems.</field><field name="creator">Sloggett, Clare, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with electron correlation effects within low-dimensional, mesoscopic systems. We study phenomena within two different types of system in which correlations play an important role. The first involves the spectra and spin structure of small symmetric quantum dots, or &amp;quoteartificial atoms&amp;quote. The second is the &amp;quote0.7 structure&amp;quote, a well-known but mysterious anomalous conductance plateau which occurs in the conductance profile of a quantum point contact.  Artificial atoms are manufactured mesoscopic devices: quantum dots which resemble real atoms in that their symmetry gives them a &amp;quoteshell structure&amp;quote. We examine two-dimensional circular artificial atoms numerically, using restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulation. We go beyond the mean-field approximation by direct calculation of second-order correlation terms; a method which works well for real atoms but to our knowledge has not been used before for quantum dots. We examine the spectra and spin structure of such dots and find, contrary to previous theoretical mean-field studies, that Hund's rule is not followed. We also find, in agreement with previous numerical studies, that the shell structure is fragile with respect to a simple elliptical deformation.  The 0.7 structure appears in the conductance of a quantum point contact. The conductance through a ballistic quantum point contact is quantised in units of 2e^2/h. On the lowest conductance step, an anomalous narrow conductance plateau at about G = 0.7 x 2e^2/h is known to exist, which cannot be explained in the non-interacting picture. Based on suggestive numerical results, we model conductance through the lowest channel of a quantum point contact analytically. The model is based on the screening of the electron-electron interaction outside the QPC, and our observation that the wavefunctions at the Fermi level are peaked within the QPC. We use a kinetic equation approach, with perturbative account of electron-electron backscattering, to demonstrate that these simple features lead to the existence of a 0.7-like structure in the conductance. The behaviour of this structure reproduces experimentally observed features of the 0.7 structure, including the temperature dependence and the behaviour under applied in-plane magnetic fields.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantum dots.</field><field name="subject">Quantum point contacts.</field><field name="subject">Mesoscopics.</field><field name="subject">Conductance.</field><field name="subject">Correlations.</field><field name="subject">Electron configuration.</field><field name="subject">Mesoscopic phenomena (Physics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular mechanism of cancer related to urokinase receptor: DNAzyme-mediated inhibition and Novel protein interactors of urokinase receptor</field><field name="creator">Lin, Zhen, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The urokinase receptor (uPAR) plays a central role in metastatic process. It???s evident uPAR is overexpressed across a variety of tumour cells and leads to the increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis of cancer. Inhibition of uPAR expression can block metastatic potential in many tumours. In addition, besides uPA, there are several other proteins which have been confirmed to interact with uPAR, such as vitronectin and integrins. These interactions also contribute to signal transduction and the functions of uPAR complex. Therefore, downregulation of uPAR expression by targeting uPAR mRNA or protein, or by regulating the uPAR partners would be potential therapeutic strategies for prevention of cancer metastasis. There are two main aspects contained in this thesis. Firstly, three specific DNAzymes targeting uPAR mRNA were designed to downregulate uPAR expression in vitro and their effects to decrease cancer cell invasion studied in a human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2. The results showed that two of them (Dz483 and Dz720) cleaved uPAR transcript in vitro with high efficacy and specificity and the Dz720 inhibited uPAR protein levels by 55% in Saos-2 cells. Besides, the Dz720 significantly suppressed Saos-2 cell invasion using an in vitro matrigel assay. Secondly, two potential uPAR partners from yeast two-hybrid screening, a heat shock protein MRJ and an anti-apoptosis protein HAX-1, were characterised and their functions binding with uPAR investigated. The interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, GST-pull down assay and confocal microscopy in cancer cells. In addition, there was a 50% increase in cell adhesion after transfection with MRJ. This increase in adhesion is dependent on the uPAR/full length MRJ interaction as cells transfected with the mutant construct containing only N-terminal region or C-terminal region of MRJ had no increase in cell adhesion. The observed increase in adhesion to vitronectin by MRJ was also blocked by an anti-uPAR domain I antibody suggesting that the induced adhesion is at least in part contributed by uPAR on the cell surface. Together, the identification of both MRJ and HAX-1 as uPAR interactors provides further insight into the intricate relationship between uPAR and other proteins which may develop potential approaches for cancer therapy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urokinase receptor.</field><field name="subject">DNAzyme.</field><field name="subject">Heat shock protein MRJ.</field><field name="subject">HAX-1.</field><field name="subject">Protein interaction.</field><field name="subject">Inhibition.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inscribing the architect :the depiction of the attributes of the architect in frontispieces to sixteenth century Italian architectural treatises</field><field name="creator">Luscombe, Desley, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the changing understanding of the role of the ???architect??? in Italy during the sixteenth century by examining frontispieces to published architectural treatises.  From analysis of these illustrations four attributes emerge as important to new societal understandings of the role of ???architect.???  The first attribute is the desire to delineate the boundaries of knowledge for architecture as a discipline, relevant to sixteenth-century society.  The second is the depiction of the ???architect,??? as an intellectual engaged in the resolution of practical, political, economic and philosophical considerations of his practice.  The third represents the ???architect??? having a specific domain of activity in the design of civic spaces of magnificence not only for patrons but also for the city per se.  The fourth represents the ???architect??? and society as perceiving a commonality of an architectural role beyond the boundary of individual locations and patrons.  Five treatises meet the criteria set for this study: Sebastiano Serlio???s Regole generali di architetura sopra le Cinque maniere de gli edifici cio??, Toscano, Dorico, Ionico, Corinthio, et Composito, con gli essempi dell???antiquita, che, per la magior parte concordano con la dottrina di Vitruvio, 1537, his, Il Terzo libro nel qual si figurano, e descrivono le antichita di Roma, 1540, Cosimo Bartoli???s translation of Alberti???s De re aedificatoria titled L???architettura di Leonbattista Alberti, tradotta in lingua fiorentina da Cossimo Bartoli, Gentilhuomo, &amp; Academico Fiorentino, 1550; Daniele Barbaro???s translation and commentary on Vitruvius??? De???architetura titled, I dieci libri dell???architettura di M. Vitruvio tradutti et commentati da monsignor Barbaro eletto Patriarca d???Aquileggia, 1556; and Andrea Palladio???s I quattro libri dell???architettura, 1570. A second aim for the study was to review the usefulness of frontispieces as an historical archive.  It was found that frontispieces visually structure important ideas by providing a narrative with meaning as an integral part of the illustration.  In this narrative frontispiece illustrations prioritise concepts found in the accompanying text and impose a hierarchical structure of importance for fundamental ideas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architects</field><field name="subject">Italian</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">16th century</field><field name="subject">early works to 1800</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The organisational world of emergency clinicians</field><field name="creator">Nugus, Peter, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: The last 30 years have seen considerable growth in the scope of emergency medicine and the size, scale and expectations of emergency departments (EDs) in the USA and other countries, including Australia. The emphasis has changed from direct referral to departments in the hospital to treatment in and disposition from the ED. At the same time, emergency clinicians face increasing pressure to address patient needs with greater efficiency. Within this context, this project describes the character of the unique domain of work and collective identity that emergency clinicians carve out in their interactions with other emergency clinicians and with clinicians from other departments.  Methods: Fieldwork was conducted over 10 months in the EDs of two tertiary referral hospitals in Sydney, Australia. It comprised approximately 535 hours of unstructured and structured observation, as well as 56 field interviews.  Results: Emergency clinicians have a unique role as "gatekeepers" of the hospital. This ensures that their clinical work is inherently organisational - that is, interdepartmental and bureaucratic work. Emergency clinicians explicitly and implicitly negotiate the "patient pathway" through the hospital which is organised according to the "fragmented" body. This role demands previously under-recognised and complex immaterial work. Emergency clinicians seek to reconcile the individual trajectories of patients present in the ED with the ED?s broader function as a "carousel" in order to seek to provide the greatest good for the greatest number of future patients. The research uniquely charts the socialisation processes and informal education that produce tacit organisational expertise with which emergency nurses and doctors, both separately and jointly, negotiate the bureaucracy of the hospital.  Conclusion: EDs are destined to struggle to provide the greatest good for the greatest number, reconciling shortcomings in the structure and provision of public and community health care. However, recognition and support for the unique clinical-organisational domain of ED care presents an opportunity for improved holistic care at the front door of the hospital. Our ageing population and its promise of more patients with complex health issues demand further research on the interdepartmental work of other whole-body specialties, such as Aged Care.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency medical personnel.</field><field name="subject">Emergency medicine -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Touching at depth: intimate spaces in the Japanese family.</field><field name="creator">Tahhan, Diana Adis, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Touch, as it is conventionally conceived, appears to be lacking in Japanese intimate relationships. Physical or visible forms of intimate touch are generally relegated to particular body practices or contexts such as co-bathing and co-sleeping, and are usually uncharacteristic of everyday experiences of intimacy. Instead, Japanese relationships are commonly defined in terms of subtle forms of communication, such as ishin denshin (heart-to-heart communication) and ittaikan (feelings of oneness), where feelings are expected to be inferred. However, it is unclear as to how such forms manifest feelings of closeness in the first place. This study opens up these feelings of closeness through exploring the embodied experience and tangible connection in the intimate spaces of the Japanese family. It describes a relational experience of space, depth and touch that is beyond the scope of conventional theories of the body. Drawing on Japanese sociologies of the body as well as other sociological tools that are relevant to everyday Japanese experiences, this study also offers universal contributions to the understandings of how touch can exist as a manifestation of intimacy. The first part of the thesis introduces the reader to the critical concepts and theories driving the study. The key ideas and understandings of Japanese relationships are also considered, leading to the suggestion that a conceptual understanding of embodiment will add to such literature. Part One concludes with a specific investigation of my field research on intimacy in Japan. The second part of the thesis explores how skinship (intimacy through touch) exists and feels in Japanese parent-child and marital relationships. A theory of touch is developed, via Japanese relationships, which is not restricted to physical or visible forms of touch. Described as touching at depth, this theory explores alternative ways of understanding experiences of intimacy that are not necessarily linked to tactile feeling or spatial closeness. Although bodily forms of touch exist in some relationships, other relational states become significant to feelings of connectedness, particularly as the child grows older. The third part of the thesis explores this shift, along with how the Japanese child adapts to the world, when their initial ways of touching no longer exist. Emphasis here is not just on primary 'home&#145; relationships, but also on teacher-child relationships, and the way familial relationships shift as the child moves back and forth between the home and world. It becomes clear in Part Three that touch becomes felt differently as the child grows older and feels their significance and connection with the world in more encompassing ways.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social capital, women's agency and the VIEW clubs of Australia.</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Christie, Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contemporary debates about collective action in civil society have given prominent place to the connections between voluntary associations and social capital.  Social capital research, however, commonly over-emphasises the role of associations in generating societal-level outcomes, to the neglect of the specific contexts in which associations reside and the different opportunities individuals and groups have to access resources for and through collective action.  Also largely ignored are considerations of gender.  This thesis addresses these issues, presenting evidence from a case study of a large women???s service organisation ??? the VIEW Clubs of Australia ??? to examine how social capital and women???s agency intersect. The thesis adopts a social-structural approach to social capital, highlighting its role as a resource brokered through networks that both enable and constrain action.  This approach attends to the inter-relations of particular types of social capital, such as bonding and bridging; specific elements of social capital, such as reciprocity, trust, and shared values, identities and purposes; and addresses the  broader socio-historical context in which social capital networks are located. The thesis employs a model of agency that encompasses three core fields of agency ??? individual, social and political.  These fields of agency encapsulate the capacity for women to ???act??? and exercise choice and change in their own lives, in the community, and in the polity, and to do this through collective action.  The thesis applies these ideas using an embedded case study model combining documentary analysis, participant observation and in-depth interviews. The findings reveal agency and social capital to be in tension.  Activities that feed the agential capacity of the organisation and its members are more successfully realised in areas closest to women???s past experiences than in those addressing the public sphere.  The research nevertheless shows that a voluntary association such as VIEW can foster women???s agency.  Indeed, building women???s capacities in society as a whole may well rely on organisational contexts where women are empowered to self-develop and connect their activities to broader society.  This is impacted by the nature, purpose, and social location of the social capital networks of women and others, and has implications for how we understand the ongoing role of voluntary associations in civil society.  By revealing how different dimensions of social capital operate and intersect with women???s agency, the thesis shows the dynamic role of voluntary associations in civil society.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social capital (Sociology) -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Agency.</field><field name="subject">Civil society -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of catastrophic rugby football injuries in New South Wales.</field><field name="creator">Rotem, Tai, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aims and objectives: To investigate the epidemiology, risk factors, and preventive strategies for serious head and spinal injuries related to rugby league and union football in New South Wales (NSW).  Methods: The three main components of this study included. 1. A retrospective analysis of clinical and compensation case file records during the 16-year period, 1984-1999. 2. A review of game rules, weights and heights of players, over the past 100 years. 3. A review of film and video footage of rugby football games spanning most of the 20th century. A method was developed to allow valid comparisons in style of play over a 70-year period.  Results: The estimated annual incidence rate of SCI for rugby league players was 1.9 (95%CI 1.3 - 2.8) per 100,000 estimated players per year, and 3.3 (95%CI 2.2 - 4.8) per 100,000 estimated rugby union players per year over the study period 1984 to 1999. There was no significant change in the incidence of rugby league related serious spinal cord injuries (1984-1999), fatalities (1984-1999) or serious head injuries (1984-1999). There was a small but significant decline in rugby union related serious spinal cord injuries (1984-1999, P&lt;0.05). However, the relative risk of spinal cord injury was 1.34 times greater for rugby union compared to rugby league over the entire study period (95%CI 1.01 - 1.67, P&lt;0.05). For rugby football, the evidence suggested that the force of impact between participants was a key causal risk factor for serious injury. Elite rugby league and union players from 1999-2000 teams were significantly heavier (P&lt;0.05) and taller (P&lt;0.05) than players pre 1950. Players in modern elite games post 1989 were more likely to be tackled by multiple opponents (P = 0.000), tackled head on (P&lt;0.05), at chest level (P&lt;0.05) and at greater speeds than their earlier counterparts pre 1958. However, modern players appear to be no more aggressive or perpetrate greater foul play than their predecessors.  Conclusions: There was a continued annual occurrence of catastrophically serious injuries leading to permanent brain damage and quadriplegia associated with rugby league and union in NSW. The critical risk factors found to be associated with serious injury in rugby football suggest relatively novel approaches to the development of preventive strategies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby football -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Rugby football injuries -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of Activin A in the regulation of adult neurogenesis.</field><field name="creator">Abdipranoto, Andrea, St. Vincent Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Adult neurogenesis is defined as the generation of new nerve cells in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Stimulating neurogenesis may potentially offer a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson???s disease. However, it is not clear why neurogenesis does not normally replace neurons lost in these diseases. As a first step to address this problem it is necessary to identify mechanisms that regulate adult neurogenesis in the normal and diseased brain and further, determine if manipulating these mechanisms may offer therapeutic potential. In this thesis, we identify activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor ?? (TGF??) superfamily, as a significant regulator of neurogenesis. We demonstrate that mRNA encoding activin A is expressed after a KA injury, and that inhibition of this activin A profoundly impairs neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Further we demonstrate that activin A impairs gliosis and also has potent anti-inflammatory effects in the injured hippocampus. Finally, we provide evidence that the majority of activin A???s neurogenic effect results from its potent anti-inflammatory actions. Our study draws a clear link between neurogenesis and inflammation in the CNS and is the first to provide evidence that this process is regulated through activin signalling. Since inflammation is now believed to be an important component of many neurological diseases we suggest that therapeutic compounds that enhance activin A signalling may offer a therapeutic approach for treating these diseases by suppressing inflammation and stimulating neurogenesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Activin.</field><field name="subject">Developmental neurobiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of ideas of reason in Kant???s political philosophy.</field><field name="creator">Keating, Paula, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the power of ideas in political philosophy and practice. It argues firstly that Kant???s ideas of reason, as he originally defines them as regulative in the First Critique, play an important role in his political philosophy and his dynamic approach to politics. Secondly, because it is fundamentally concerned with political transition and improvement, Kant???s approach to politics is therefore one that has continuing relevance. Evidence for this is provided via an examination of Rawls??? political liberalism and the manner in which the idea of the reasonable fulfils the role of an idea of reason. The thesis begins with an examination of the regulative use of ideas of reason in the Dialectic of the First Critique: the ideas of soul, world and God become guides for practice, insofar as they are not bearers of truth but instead create essential conditions necessary for human life and meaning. Chapter Two then demonstrates how ideas of reason figure in Kant???s political texts. They condition politics by inspiring the practice of their objects, for example, the establishment of a rightful condition, the security of private property, the perpetuation of peace. That they look to the status quo in order to effect politics, demonstrates their concern with social progress. Chapter Three argues that publicity forms the primary political idea of reason as it enables the polity to use ideas of reason. Because publicity provides the test of efficient and rightful politics, we can say that it is through publicity that Kant???s politics is grounded. Chapter Four investigates Rawls??? political liberalism and observes that the primacy of the idea of the reasonable in his theory works according to a system of ideas of reason as proposed by Kant. Chapter Five then makes a final comparison between Kant and Rawls to demonstrate that ideas of reason, in particular the pre-eminent political idea of public reason, is central to both their conceptions of the political condition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reason.</field><field name="subject">Political science.</field><field name="subject">Kant, Immanuel, 1724-1804.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subjects, objects, and the fetishisms of modernity in the works of Gertrude Stein</field><field name="creator">Livett, Kate, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reopens the question of subject/object relations in the works of Gertrude Stein, to argue that the fetishisms theorised by Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and later Walter Benjamin and Michael Taussig, and problematised by feminist critics such as Elizabeth Grosz, are central to the structure of those relations. My contribution to Stein scholarship is twofold, and is reflected in the division of my thesis into Part One and Part Two.	Part One of this thesis establishes a model for reading the interconnections between subjects and objects in Stein???s work; it identifies a tension between two related yet different structures. The first is a fetishistic relation of subjects to objects, associated by Stein with materiality and nineteenth-century Europe, and the identity categories of the ???genius??? and the ???collector???. The second is a ???new??? figuration of late modernity in which the processual and tacility are central. This latter is associated by Stein with America and the twentieth century, and was a structure that she, along with other modernist artists, was developing. Further, Part One shows how these competing structures of subject/object relations hinge on Stein???s problematic formulations of self, nation, and artistic production.	Part Two uses the model established in Part One to examine the detailed playing-out of the tensions and dilemmas of subject/object relations within several major Stein texts. First considered is the category of the object as it is constructed in Tender Buttons, and second the category of the subject as it is represented in the nexus of those competing structures in The Making of Americans and ???Melanctha???. The readings of Part Two engage with the major strands of Stein criticism of materiality, sexuality, and language in Tender Buttons, Stein???s famous study of objects. The critical areas engaged with in her biggest and most controversial texts respectively ??? The Making of Americans and ???Melanctha??? ??? include typology, ???genius???, and Stein???s methodologies of writing such as repetition/iteration, intersubjectivity, and ???daily living???. This thesis contends that the dilemma of subject/object relations identified and examined in detail is never resolved, indeed, its ongoing reverberations are productive up until and including her final work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stein</field><field name="subject">modernism</field><field name="subject">fetishism</field><field name="subject">subjects</field><field name="subject">objects</field><field name="subject">nation</field><field name="subject">genius</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of neurotransmitter release mechanisms in dopamine neurons.</field><field name="creator">Daniel, James, St. Vincent Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Medications that treat diseases such as Parkinson???s disease work by regulating dopamine transmission at synapses. Surprisingly, little is known about the mechanisms regulating dopamine release at synapses. In this thesis, we study mechanisms that regulate vesicle recycling in axons and dendrites of dopamine neurons. Key questions we addressed were: (1) Are vesicles in axons and dendrites associated with the same regulatory proteins, and thus by implication the same regulatory mechanisms, as in excitatory neurons; (2) Do vesicles undergo recycling, and (3) if so, are they characterised by a distinct pool size and rate of recycling. To study this, we cultured dopamine neurons and used immunocytochemistry to detect vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and identify axons, dendrites and synaptic proteins, combined with labelling of recycling vesicles using FM 1-43. Vesicles in axons, but not in dendrites, were associated with presynaptic proteins such as Synaptophysin and Bassoon. We identified two kinds of presynaptic sites in axons: ???synaptic??? (located close to soma and dendrites??? and ???orphan???. The recycling vesicle pool size was smaller at orphan sites than at synaptic sites, and the initial rate of vesicle pool release was also lower at orphan sites. Both synaptic and orphan sites exhibited lower rates of vesicle pool release compared to hippocampal synapses, suggesting functional differences in presynaptic physiology between dopamine neurons and hippocampal neurons. In somatodendritic regions, VMAT2 was localised to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosome, and large dense-core vesicles, suggesting that these vesicles might function as a part of the regulated secretory pathway in mediating dopamine release. None of the synaptic vesicle proteins we studied were detected in these regions, although some preliminary evidence of vesicle turnover was detected using FM 1-43 labelling. This thesis provides a detailed analysis of neurotransmitter release mechanisms in dopamine neurons. Our data suggests that presynaptic release of dopamine is mediated by mechanisms similar to those observed in excitatory neurons. In somatodendritic regions, our data suggests that VMAT2 is localised to organelles in secretory pathways, and that distinct mechanisms of release might be present at somatodendritic sites to those present in presynaptic sites. This thesis provides novel methods for analysing vesicle recycling in dopamine neurons, which provides the basis for further studies examining presynaptic function of dopamine neurons in normal brain function, disease, and therapeutic approaches.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neurotransmitters.</field><field name="subject">Dopaminergic neurons - Transplantation.</field><field name="subject">Parkinson???s disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real time communications over on-board mobile networks</field><field name="creator">Malik, Muhammad Ali, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has recently released routing standards that allow deployment of TCP/IP local area networks (LANs) onboard a moving vehicle and yet maintain permanent connectivity of the onboard LAN to the Internet via a vehicular mobile router. This recent development opens up new opportunities for providing efficient mobile computing for users on the move, especially for commuters traveling on public transports. Supporting real-time communications, e.g. IP Telephony, on-line video on demand, etc., over such onboard mobile networks is the main motivation of this thesis. Due to the volatility of the wireless bandwidth available to connect the moving LAN to the Internet at different locations of the trip, supporting on-line services that require bandwidth guarantees becomes a challenging task. The main problem investigated is how to provide bandwidth guarantee efficiently, effectively, and in a scalable manner in the context of moving onboard networks. To achieve the goal, a systematic approach is taken that involves (i) designing a signalling protocol that allows transparent bandwidth reservation for the aggregate demand of all onboard users in the vehicle, and (ii) proposing effective aggregation and bandwidth reservation policies that aim to maximize the chances of successful reservation and minimize the bandwidth and processing overhead in critical network elements. Mathematical models are derived to evaluate the performance of proposed solutions. These models are validated using discrete event simulation. One important conclusion reached is that onboard mobile communication provides significant aggregation and centralized management opportunities that must be exploited to provide a scalable solution to the bandwidth guarantee problem in mobile communications. The techniques proposed and analyzed in this thesis to exploit such aggregation opportunities constitute the original contribution to knowledge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="subject">Personal communicaiton communication service systems.</field><field name="subject">Wireless Internet.</field><field name="subject">Local area networks (Computer networks)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The empty space.</field><field name="creator">Mataraga, Francesca, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Empty Space project aims to explore the interior and exterior space of an object through the use of Perspex. The solidity of the concrete or minimalist art object and the space that it physically occupies will be challenged by the use of visually ambiguous material. Physically solid yet visually transparent or reflective, perspex challenges our perception of solidity - what is internal and what is external. It is by nature a subversive and ambiguous material. The visual transparency of the material contradicts the physical presence of the object it creates. It creates a play between presence and absence. It is this spatial contradiction that this project exploits in order to create physical and visual tension. The solid physicality of the objects will directly draw on the tradition of concrete art and the language of minimalism. The visual transparency of the material will however, subvert this language both conceptually and literally. This will make the relationship between internal and external space more complex, challenging the physicality of the art object and questioning the nature of solidity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space (Art)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spin and charge properties of Si: P probed using ion-implanted nanostructures</field><field name="creator">McCamey, Dane Robert, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the defects, charge states and spin properties of phosphorus doped silicon, and is motivated by a number of proposals for quantum information processing (QIP) that involve using the spin or charge of individual donors in silicon as qubits. The implantation of phosphorus into silicon is investigated; specifically the ability to remove damage and activate the implanted donors. The impact of implantation on the transport properties of silicon MOSFETs at cryogenic temperatures is used to investigate the damage. Implanting phosphorus into the MOSFET channel leads to reduced electron mobility. The defect density increases linearly with implant density (??ndefect = 0.08 ?? 0.01nimplant). Silicon implantation does not show this effect, suggesting that the additional defects are ionised P donors in the channel. Implant activation for low density donors was complete for an implant density of 2 x 1012 cm2. Similar studies were undertaken on devices with a variety of dielectrics. Thermally grown SiO2 was found to have the lowest defect density of those studied, although Al2O3 deposited via atomic layer deposition was found to have properties that may be useful for the fabrication of devices with low thermal processing budgets. The as-grown defect density of the thermal silicon dioxide was found to be 2.1 ?? 0.3 x 1011 cm2. Ion implantation of nanoscale devices allowed the spin properties of a small number of phosphorus donors in silicon to be probed via electrically detected magnetic resonance. This allowed the detection of the spin resonance of as few as 100 spins. This represents an improvement in number detection of 4 orders of magnitude over previous EDMR studies of donors in silicon. EDMR was used to investigate the properties of P donors in isotopically purified 28Si . The material had a background doping level too high to detect small numbers of spins, however, the narrow linewidth of the phosphorus resonance confirm that the isotopic purity is greater than 0.999. A proof-of-principle demonstration of pulsed EDMR of ion-implanted donors in silicon is presented. The spin dependent transient that results from manipulating the donor spins via pulsed ESR is sensitive to as few as 104 donors, and is a required component for observation of spin Rabi oscillations by this technique.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanostructures.</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnology.</field><field name="subject">Electron para magnetic resonance.</field><field name="subject">Silicon.</field><field name="subject">Ion implantation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Museums and Australia???s Greek textile heritage: the desirability and ability of State museums to be inclusive of diverse cultures through the reconciliation of public cultural policies with private and community concerns.</field><field name="creator">Coward, Ann, Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the desirability of Australia???s State museums to be inclusive of diverse cultures. In keeping with a cultural studies approach, and a commitment to social action, emphasis is placed upon enhancing the ability of State museums to fulfil obligations and expectations imposed upon them as modern collecting institutions in a culturally diverse nation. By relating the desirability and ability of State museums to attaining social justice in a multicultural Australia through broadening the concept of Australia???s heritage, the thesis is firmly situated within post-colonial discourse.  The thesis analyses State multicultural, heritage, and museum legislation, in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, with regard to State museums as agents of cultural policy. Results from a survey, Greeks and Museums, conducted amongst Australia???s Greeks in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, reveal an anomaly between their museum-going habits and the perception of those habits as expressed by government policies promoting the inclusion of Australians of a non-English speaking background in the nation???s cultural programmes. In exploring the issue of inclusiveness, the thesis highlights the need for cultural institutions to shift the emphasis away from audience development, towards greater audience participation. The thesis outlines an initiative-derived Queensland Model for establishing an inclusive relationship between museums and communities, resulting in permanent, affordable, and authoritative collections, while simultaneously improving the museums??? international reputation and networking capabilities.  By using the example of one of the nation???s non-indigenous communities, and drawing upon material obtained through the survey, and a catalogue containing photographs and lists of Greek textile collections found in the Powerhouse Museum (MAAS), Sydney, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Immigration Museum, Melbourne, the Queensland Art Gallery and the Queensland Museum, Brisbane, as well as collections owned by private individuals, the thesis focuses on the role played by museums in constructing social cohesion and inclusiveness.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">museums</field><field name="subject">cultural diversity</field><field name="subject">multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">heritage</field><field name="subject">Greek textiles</field><field name="subject">cultural policy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capital structure and dividend policy in a personal tax free environment: the case of Oman</field><field name="creator">Al Yahyaee, Khamis, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines four specific aspects of capital structure and dividend policy. The first issue concerns the determinants of capital structure dynamics. The primary objective is to examine whether stock returns are important factors in firm???s capital structure choice, and if so, whether this effect is persistent. In so doing, we use a data set which (1) avoids the complexity of tax rates faced by previous studies, (2) we introduce new variables that are unique to Oman, and (3) we distinguish empirically between bank debt and non-bank debt. We find stock returns are a first order determinant of capital structure. Firms do show some tendency to rebalance towards their target capital structure. However, the impact of stock returns dominates the effects of rebalancing. We also find new evidence that firms do take countermeasures to offset changes in their leverage that stem from equity value variations, but do so at a low speed. The next topic studied concerns the ex-dividend day behaviour. We investigate this issue using a unique data set where there are no taxes on dividends and capital gains and stock prices are decimalized. In this economy, any price decline that is smaller than the dividends can not be attributed to taxes and price discreteness. We find that the stock price drops by less than the amount of dividends and there is a significant positive ex-day return. We are able to account for our results using market microstructure models. The third issue investigated is the stock price reaction to dividend announcements. Tax-based signaling models argue that dividends would not have  information and be informative if it is not for the higher taxes on dividends relative to capital gains that they apply to shareholders. The absence of personal taxes in Oman presents a valuable opportunity to test this prediction. Our results show that the announcements of dividend increases (decreases) are associated with a stock price increase (decrease) which contradicts the tax-based signaling models. The final chapter analyzes the determinants and stability of dividend policy of financial and non-financial firms. Investigating this issue is important for at least two reasons. First, Omani firms distribute almost 100% of their profits in dividends which led the Capital Market Authority (CMA) to issue a circular (number 12/2003) arguing that firms should retain some of their earnings for ???rainy days???. This allows us understand the characteristics of firms that pay dividends. Second, firms are highly levered mainly through bank loans which render the role of dividends in reducing the agency costs less important. Unlike most previous studies, we include both dividend paying and non-dividend paying firms to avoid a selection bias. We find that there are some common factors that determine dividend policy of both financial and non-financial firms and there are some factors that affect only non-financial firms. We also find that the factors that influence the probability to pay dividends are the same factors that drive the amount of dividends paid for both financial and non-financial firms. We document that non-financial firms adopt a policy of smoothing dividends while financial firms do not have a stable dividend policy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Oman -- Finance</field><field name="subject">Dividends</field><field name="subject">Stocks -- Prices</field><field name="subject">Bank capital -- Oman</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depression through Chinese eyes: a window into public mental health in multicultural Australia</field><field name="creator">Chan, Bibiana Chi Wing, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Under-utilisation of mental health services is widespread globally and within Australia, especially among culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. Improving service access is a priority, as is the need to deliver culturally competent services to the CALD communities. Having migrated to Australia in waves for approximately 150 years from China and South East Asia for various social, political and economic reasons, the Chinese population in Sydney is now the fastest growing non-English speaking ethnic group.  There is a need to better understand the impact of culture on the emotional experiences of these Chinese in Australia. How do Chinese make sense of their depressive episodes?  To address this question, this study explored the ways participants reach out for medical and/or non-medical help. Lay concepts of illness underpin these decisions and were thus unveiled. Mixed-method research design provided the opportunity to bring together multiple vantage points of investigation: population mental health, transcultural psychiatry and medical anthropology. A study combining quantitative survey and qualitative focus groups was undertaken in metropolitan Sydney. Narratives on symptoms, explanatory models and help-seeking strategies were articulated by focus group informants. Surveys covered demographics, symptom-recognition, previous depressive experiences and professional help sought. Depression measurement tools were cross-culturally validated. Self-ratings of ethnic identities and the Suinn-Lew Self-Identity Acculturation Scale were used to quantify Chinese participants' acculturation level. This allowed comparisons between 'low-acculturated' Chinese', highly-acculturated' Chinese and Australians. Survey results showed comparable levels of symptom-recognition in all subgroups. Focus group discussions provided rich data on informants'  help-seeking strategies. Highly acculturated Chinese closely resembled the Australians in many study variables, yet qualitative data suggested cultural gaps beyond language barriers in influencing service use.  Participants believed that trustful relationships could work as the bridge to link services with those in need. The implications for Australia's mental health policy include recognising the importance of rapport-building and the existence of cultural gaps.  The study indicated professionals can benefit from acquiring information about the mental health beliefs both of individual clients and the wider ethnic communities in which they belong, and respecting the cultural differences between helper and helped as the first step towards cultural competency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health.</field><field name="subject">Depression.</field><field name="subject">Mental illness.</field><field name="subject">Acculturation.</field><field name="subject">Cultural competency.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Mental health -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Mental health services -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Community mental health services -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Community mental health services -- Planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetic modelling studies of As(III) oxidation in dark pH 3 and 8 Fenton - mediated and pH 8 Cu(II) - H2O2 systems</field><field name="creator">Botfield, Andrew, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a combination of laboratory experimentation under well defined conditions coupled with a kinetic modelling approach is used to verify the existence and respective kinetic rates of previously unconfirmed or postulated mechanisms that drive and limit dark Fenton (Fe(II)/H2O2) - mediated As(III) oxidation at pH 3 and 8 and dark Cu(II) - H2O2 - mediated As(III) oxidation at pH 8. Dark Fenton - mediated oxidation of As(III) at pH 3 is first examined and the effects of the variation in the concentration of reactants (As(III), Fe(II) and H2O2), oxygen, phosphate and organics (2 - propanol, formate, and citrate) are reported and analysed. The kinetic models developed for these systems show high applicability to full scale water treatment application and key mechanistic findings include the significance of the cycling of Fe(II) / Fe(III) via HO2 ???/O2 ??????, the effects of As(IV) termination reactions in the absence of oxygen and the retarding effects of phosphate due to the postulated formation of a Fe(III) - phosphate complex (at a derived rate constant of 2.2 x 106 M-1s-1, that also appears to have negligible kinetic activity in terms of reduction to Fe(II) by HO2 ???/O2 ??????). The work also demonstrates the significance of the free radical by products of formate and citrate oxidation by ???OH (HCOO???/CO2 ?????? and 3HGA???2???). The examination of the dark Cu(II) - H2O2 - mediated oxidation of As(III) at pH 8 with variation in the concentration of reactants (As(III), Fe(II) and H2O2), carbonate and organics (2 - propanol, formate and citrate) demonstrated for the first time the high applicability of this system to the  pre - oxidation of As(III) in water treatment and mechanistically that ???OH and CO3 ?????? are the dominant As(III) oxidants in this system. The As(III) oxidant CO3 ??????, is suggested to be generated by the interaction of ???OH and O2 ?????? with the carbonate matrix, at the respective rate constants of 4.9 x 107 M-1s-1 and 5.5 x 106 M-1s-1. Examination of the dark Fenton - mediated oxidation of As(III) at pH 8 and the effects of variation in the concentration of reactants (As(III), Fe(II) and H2O2), carbonate, organics (2 - propanol, formate and citrate) and Cu(II) demonstrates the varied potential mechanistic pathways in relation to the generation of As(III) oxidants from the Fenton reaction, Fe(II) + H2O2 such as Fe(IV) and CO3 ?????? and the previously dismissed ???OH, due to the presence of Fe(II) - citrate complexes.

AGSM, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two studies were undertaken in order to investigate the effect of different forms of error feedback  and error framing in learning a complex novel task. The experimental task in both studies was a computer-based simulation of a group management situation. After each of the 12 trials, all participants received feedback about their performance on that trial. Participants receiving signal error feedback were also advised as to where they had made errors. Participants receiving diagnostic feedback were told how they could have achieved optimum performance on the previous trial. Learning, performance, strategy, exploration and depth of processing were measured during the task. Self-report measures of self-efficacy, self-set goals, satisfaction and intrinsic motivation were taken after the first six trials and again after all 12 trials were completed. In study 1, detailed diagnostic feedback was associated with better performance than feedback which simply signaled where an error had been made, or feedback that did not identify errors. Diagnostic feedback facilitated the development and use of effective problem-solving strategies and discouraged trial-and-error exploration of the problem space. In this research, exploration was found to be negatively associated with learning and performance. Learners??? self-efficacy moderated the effects of error feedback: learners with high self-efficacy showed high levels of performance regardless of the level of information that the feedback provided but for those with low self-efficacy, detailed diagnostic feedback was essential for the learning process. In the second study, positive error framing (error management) was investigated as a possible means of making signal error feedback more valuable in learning. However while positive error framing was associated with more exploration as expected, it also produced poorer strategies and worse performance than negative error framing (error avoidance instructions). Participants who used good learning strategies instead of exploration performed well despite impoverished feedback. Self-efficacy moderated the impact of error framing: positive error framing helped those with low self-efficacy, but for those with higher self-efficacy it was of more value to encourage error avoidance than error tolerance. The findings show important interactions between error framing, error feedback and learner characteristics.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feedback (Psychology) .

The self-healing approach to composite repair has been developed in the last two decades and means that a damaged area can be repaired by material already housed within the structure. The background and development of self-healing has been reviewed. The two main self-healing mechanisms are discussed. To date only two part self healing systems have been examined. These require diffusion of the separate constituents to a single location in order to effect cure and restore strength. Single part adhesives do not have this disadvantage and are therefore very attractive. Several candidate single-part adhesive or resin systems were considered and discussed according to the critical requirements of a self-healing system. A series of experiments was undertaken to evaluate the possibility of candidate adhesive systems being effective for self-healing by focusing on the determination of storage stability and bonding efficiency. The results of storage stability testing showed that the stability of cyanoacrylate and polyurethane adhesives was poor. However silane and polystyrene cements showed good storage stability. Very low bonding efficiency was achieved with polystyrene cement but a 22% strength recovery was obtained with the silane 3-[tris(trimethylsiloxy)silyl]-propylamine.

Simple linear dynamic models are used extensively in process control practice, but they are limited to the type of process behavior they can approximate. It is well-documented that simple nonlinear models can often provide much better approximations to process dynamics than linear models. It is evident that there is a potential of significant improvement of control quality through the implementation of the model-based control procedures. However, such control applications are still not widely implemented because mathematical process models in model-based control could be very difficult and expensive to obtain due to the complexity of those systems and poor understanding of the underlying physics. The main objective of this thesis is to develop new approaches to modeling and control of nonlinear processes.  In this thesis, the multivariable nonlinear processes are approximated using a model with a static nonlinearity and a linear dynamics. In particular, the Hammerstein model structure, where the nonlinearity is on the input, is used. Cardinal spline functions are used to identify the multivariable input nonlinearity. Highlycoupled nonlinearity can also be identified due to flexibility and versatility of cardinal spline functions. An approach that can be used to identify both the nonlinearity and linear dynamics in a single step has been developed. The condition of persistent excitation has also been derived.  Nonlinear control design approaches for the above models are then developed in this thesis based on: (1) a nonlinear compensator; (2) the extended internal model control (IMC); and (3) the model predictive control (MPC) framework. The concept of passivity is used to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system of each of the approaches. In the nonlinear compensator approach, the passivity of the process is recovered using an appropriate static nonlinearity. The non-passive linear system is passified using a feedforward system, so that the passified overall system can be stabilized by a passive linear controller with the nonlinear compensator. In the extended IMC approach, dynamic inverses are used for both the input nonlinearity and linear dynamics. The concept of passive systems and the passivity-based stability conditions are used to obtain the invertible approximations of the subsystems and guarantee the stability of the nonlinear closed-loop system. In the MPC approach, a numerical inverse is implemented. The condition for which the numerical inversion is guaranteed to converge is derived. Based on these conditions, the input space in which the numerical inverse can be obtained is identified. This constitutes new constraints on the input space, in addition to the physical input constraints. The total input constraints are transformed into linear input constraints using polytopic descriptions and incorporated in the MPC design.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical process control.</field><field name="subject">Chemical processes.</field><field name="subject">Predictive control.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connecting genotype to phenotype: drosophila simulans mitochondria as a model.</field><field name="creator">Melvin, Richard G, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The influence of genotype variation on phenotype has been a longstanding question in biology but it is now one of the greatest challenges of the post-genomics era. Discovering the link between common gene variants that affect phenotypes within and between populations is likely to provide insight into the molecular physiology of phenotypic traits and the mechanisms by which they evolve. The overall goal of this thesis is to link naturally occurring genotypic variation with the organism??s phenotype. The specific goal of this thesis is to connect natural variation in the mitochondrial genotype with the organismal phenotype using the model organism Drosophila simulans.  Mitochondria are intracellular organelles found in most eukaryotes and produce over 90% of the energy needed by cells. Determining the connection of mitochondrial genotype to whole organism phenotype is of particular interest because of the broad use of mitochondrial (mt) DNA as a molecular marker in evolutionary biology and population genetics, the organelle??s central role in cellular energy production, the potential for the mitochondria to influence organismal distribution particularly in the face of climate change and in human degenerative disease. I use the model organism D. simulans because it has high genetic variability, can be easily sampled from the wild and manipulated in the lab, and the energy producing reactions that take place in its mitochondria are highly conserved among metazoa. I studied naturally occurring mutations to understand the influence of these changes in natural populations.  The four studies in this thesis have employed a Genotype-Biochemistry-Phenotype (GBP) model to link naturally occurring variation in the mitochondrial genotype with organism phenotype in D. simulans mitochondria. Three major conclusions can be drawn from the thesis that follow the genotype to biochemistry to phenotype model. Firstly, a subset of the mutations in genes that comprise the mitochondrial genotype is functionally significant. Secondly, the biochemical efficiency of OXPHOS is regulated by mitochondrial homeostasis. Thirdly, key organismal life history traits influenced by the mitochondrial genotype and this is mediated through the biochemistry of OXPHOS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genotype</field><field name="subject">Phenotype</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">mtDNA</field><field name="subject">Drosophila</field><field name="subject">Candidate complex approach</field><field name="subject">Cytochrome c oxidase</field><field name="subject">Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Drosophilidae</field><field name="subject">Genotype-environment interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painting narrative: the form and place of narrative within astatic medium</field><field name="creator">Edney, Katherine, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Within painting, there are numerous possibilities for the ways in which a narrative can be compositionally presented in order to communicate a particular emotion or story. Traditional devices including gesture, facial expression, interaction of figures and symbolism establish foundations within the composition to facilitate a narrative response and formulate questions as to the how, what and why. This formal language may also be considered in addition to other concepts surrounding the term narrative itself. The notion of narrative as something which is fluid also encompasses issues of time, movement, and continuity; idea??s which seemingly contradict the static temperament of painting. How painters have been able to successfully construct elements of narrative in their work, while also capturing a sense of movement or a passage of time is the starting point at which the following research takes shape. When embarking on this project, I realised that there was no definitive text on this subject which specifically analysed the form and composition of pictorial narratives as sole entities. Theoretical discussions surrounding a painting??s formal arrangement have mostly been produced in relation to how they either illustrated or have been adapted from a written source. This paper is intended to examine the structure of narrative paintings from a stand alone visual perspective, and not how they are comparative to a literary source. Over the course of this investigation, I subsequently found that the methodologies of continuous narrative paintings from the Renaissance echoed certain theoretical concerns within contemporary cinematic narratives. While painting and film maintain a relationship to some degree because they are both visual media, (in reference to colour, tone and symbolism), the most interesting parallel is the depiction of time. This correlation between painting and film, where elements of the narrative are compositionally presented in a non-linear way, has had the most important influence over the production of my work for the exhibition, ??Hidden Fractures; A Narrative in Time??. Certain structures within film, such as event ??order?? and sequencing resonate correspondingly to the stylistic approach sustained within recent work. This ??jig-saw?? method, presents individual paintings (or canvases) akin to pieces of a story which  have been sliced up, and placed back together out of their ??chronological?? order. These chosen snippets may represent a scene or emotion, and uphold their own position or viewpoint in relation to another image or painting. These unmatched sequences of images, similar to the unmatched sequences in film, can disrupt the perception and flow of space, and sense of narrative order. When sequences are viewed out of order, the perception of events within the narrative change. The viewer strives to construct the meaning of the work dependent upon each image??s relationship to another, in turn forming the underlying narrative. Through such ??story comprehension??, the viewer endeavours to create ??logical connections among data in order to match general categories of schema??.

The project approaches the question in three parts: 1.	A review of literature exploring the circumstances in which and for what reasons sexually explicit HIV/AIDS campaigns are produced. 2.	An analysis of seven interviews with producers of HIV prevention campaigns exploring how, why, where and for what reasons explicit campaigns are produced. 3.	An analysis of eight interviews with homosexually active Sydney men exploring how HIV prevention campaigns are viewed, consumed and understood.  The interviews were in-depth, semi-structured and conducted over one hour per interviewee.  The findings are dominated by two interrelated and at times conflicting themes. First, that there is a strongly held belief by campaign producers that the most effective HIV prevention campaigns targeting gay men are produced by the community and reflect that community and as a result must at times be sexually explicit. Second, that it is no longer sufficient for HIV prevention campaigns to rely on explicit sex to attract attention. In an environment where visual images, and sexually explicit visual images especially, are becoming more accessible, and media and communication is more prevalent and complex, safe sex campaigns are forced to deliver ever more sophisticated and stimulating creative materials in order to maintain the engagement of gay men. The interviews revealed that both campaign producers and consumers participated in the production of a visual literacy of safe sex campaigns.  This literacy was necessary to both effectively produce and comprehend the campaigns. The interviews showed that while HIV prevention campaigns that use sexually explicit language and imagery can be highly effective at engaging gay men, the success of sexually explicit campaigns is contextual that is, dependent on where, to whom and in what circumstances the materials are delivered. The audience??s accumulation of knowledge and cultural experience when viewing the campaigns, in other words their safe sex campaign literacy, significantly influenced their capacity to understand, appreciate and be engaged with sexually explicit HIV prevention campaigns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Social marketing</field><field name="subject">Campaign</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Gay men</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Australia -- Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CircularTrip and ArcTrip:effective grid access methods for continuous spatial queries.</field><field name="creator">Cheema, Muhammad Aamir, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A k nearest neighbor query q retrieves k objects that lie closest to the query point q among a given set of objects P. With the availability of inexpensive location aware mobile devices, the continuous monitoring of such queries has gained lot of attention and many methods have been proposed for continuously monitoring the kNNs in highly dynamic environment. Multiple continuous queries require real-time results and both the objects and queries issue frequent location updates. Most popular spatial index, R-tree, is not suitable for continuous monitoring of these queries due to its inefficiency in handling frequent updates. Recently, the interest of database community has been shifting towards using grid-based index for continuous queries due to its simplicity and efficient update handling. For kNN queries, the order in which cells of the grid are accessed is very important. In this research, we present two efficient and effective grid access methods, CircularTrip and ArcTrip, that ensure that the number of cells visited for any continuous kNN query is minimum. Our extensive experimental study demonstrates that CircularTrip-based continuous kNN algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of both efficiency and space requirement. Moreover, we show that CircularTrip and ArcTrip can be used for many other variants of nearest neighbor queries like constrained nearest neighbor queries, farthest neighbor queries and (k + m)-NN queries. All the algorithms presented for these queries preserve the properties that they visit minimum number of cells for each query and the space requirement is low. Our proposed techniques are flexible and efficient and can be used to answer any query that is hybrid of above mentioned queries. For example, our algorithms can easily be used to efficiently monitor a (k + m) farthest neighbor query in a constrained region with the flexibility that the spatial conditions that constrain the region can be changed by the user at any time.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nearest neighbor analysis (Statistics)</field><field name="subject">Querying (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Query languages (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Data structures (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Real-time data processing.</field><field name="subject">Geographic information systems -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Computational grids (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">Computer algorithms.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Object validity and effects</field><field name="creator">Lu, Yi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The object-oriented community is paying increasing attention to techniques for object instance encapsulation and alias protection. Formal techniques for modular verification of programs at the level of objects are being developed hand in hand with type systems and static analysis techniques for restricting the structure of runtime object graphs. Ownership type systems have provided a sound basis for such structural restrictions by being able to statically represent an extensible object ownership hierarchy. However, such structural restrictions may potentially have limitations on cases when more flexible reference structures are desired.  In this thesis, we present a different encapsulation technique, called Effect Encapsulation, which confines side effects rather than object references. With relaxed restriction on reference structure, it is able to express certain common object-oriented patterns which cannot be expressed in Ownership Types. From this basis, we also describe a model of Object Validity --- a framework for reasoning about object invariants. Such a framework can track the effect and dependency of method calls on object invariants within an ownership-based type system, even in the presence of re-entrant calls. Moreover, we present an access control technique for protecting object instances. Combined with context variance, the resulting type system allows for a more flexible and useful access control policy, hence is capable of expressing more object-oriented patterns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Programming languages</field><field name="subject">Object-oriented</field><field name="subject">Object invariants</field><field name="subject">Type and effect systems</field><field name="subject">Object-oriented programming (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling, information capacity, and estimation of time-varying channels in mobile communication systems</field><field name="creator">Sadeghi, Parastoo, School of Electrical Engineering And Telecommunications, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the first part of this thesis, the information capacity of time-varying fading channels is analysed using finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) models. Both fading channel amplitude and fading channel phase are modelled as finite-state Markov processes. The effect of the number of fading channel gain partitions on the capacity is studied (from 2 to 128 partitions). It is observed that the FSMC capacity is saturated when the number of fading channel gain partitions is larger than 4 to 8 times the number of channel input levels. The rapid FSMC capacity saturation with a small number of fading channel gain partitions can be used for the design of computationally simple receivers, with a negligible loss in the capacity. Furthermore, the effect of fading channel memory order on the capacity is studied (from first- to fourth-order). It is observed that low-order FSMC models can provide higher capacity estimates for fading channels than high-order FSMC models, especially when channel states are poorly observable in the presence of channel noise. To explain the effect of memory order on the FSMC capacity, the capacities of high-order and low-order FSMC models are analytically compared. It is shown that the capacity difference is caused by two factors: 1) the channel entropy difference, and 2) the channel observability difference between the high-order and low-order FSMC models. Due to the existence of the second factor, the capacity of high-order FSMC models can be lower than the capacity of low-order FSMC models. Two sufficient conditions are proven to predict when the low-order FSMC capacity is higher or lower than the high-order FSMC capacity. In the second part of this thesis, a new implicit (blind) channel estimation method in time- varying fading channels is proposed. The information source emits bits ???0??? and ???1??? with unequal probabilities. The unbalanced source distribution is used as a priori known signal  structure at the receiver for channel estimation. Compared to pilot-symbol-assisted channel estimation, the proposed channel estimation technique can achieve a superior receiver bit error rate performance, especially at low signal to noise ratio conditions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Radio -- Transmitters and transmission-- Fading -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Adaptive signal processing -- Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relative performance of alternative investment vehicles: hedge funds, funds of funds, and CTA funds</field><field name="creator">Madigele, Loago Thabang wa ga Mmamogapi, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the degree to which alternative funds deviate from their style-benchmark and how this is related to past performance and fund size, and how it impacts future risk and returns. Additionally the thesis examines how security selection and market timing skills differ across varying degrees of deviation from the benchmark. The thesis uses data for hedge funds, funds of funds, and CTA funds from the Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets and employs fund???s tracking error relative to their style-benchmark to estimate the level of drift. The style-benchmarks used are the median return for all reporting funds that follow a particular style and funds are assigned a benchmark based on their self-reported style. First, this thesis documents statistically significant differences in the tracking errors of portfolios of funds with the highest tracking error versus funds with the lowest tracking error, implying that some managers drift from their self-reported style-benchmarks. Second, funds??? benchmark-inconsistency is less severe in the case of funds that have a regulatory obligation to disclose their performance, suggesting that the absence of regulation fosters an environment where managers can be more flexible with their investment approach. Third, the tendency to drift from the benchmark is most prevalent amongst funds with superior past performance as well as small funds. Fourth, future total portfolio risk increases as funds display more benchmarkinconsistency, suggesting that managers adopt riskier strategies as they attempt to enhance returns. Fifth, the thesis demonstrates that CTA funds that display drift from their benchmark produce higher absolute and relative returns in subsequent  periods regardless of the direction of the general market. In contrast, the findings show for hedge funds and funds of funds, benchmark-inconsistent funds are likely to outperform in bull markets and underperform in bear markets. Finally, this thesis shows that more benchmark-consistent managers have better security selection skill. The main contribution of this thesis is in identifying the group of hedge funds, funds of funds, and CTA funds that are likely to deviate from their self-reported style-benchmark and the risk-return consequences of such deviations. The findings have implications for investors and regulators.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hedge funds -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Commodity trading advisors</field><field name="subject">Portfolio management</field><field name="subject">Investment analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The VCLP concessions as a tool of capital market design</field><field name="creator">Banfield, Stephen, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the early stages of the Hawke government, Australia???s taxation system has been modified with a view to attracting additional capital into the domestic venture capital market. In December 2002, the Howard government enacted the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth). This legislative package created a prospective concession primarily aimed at qualifying limited partnerships who participate in the Australian venture capital market. Subject to a rather stringent qualification criteria, such partnerships are treated as fiscally transparent for the purposes of Australian taxation law. In addition, the gains made upon the disposal of portfolio investments by these partnerships may not be subject to Australian capital gains tax (&amp;quotCGT&amp;quot) or otherwise assessable as ordinary income. The central concept of these measures is the venture capital limited partnership (&amp;quotVCLP&amp;quot), and other fund of fund organisational forms which are founded on the limited partnership. For this reason, the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth) are collectively identified as the &amp;quotVCLP Concessions&amp;quot. This thesis has been prepared as a rigorous assessment of the VCLP Concessions. It draws upon an analysis of the nature and structure of venture capital investing to determine whether the particular features of the VCLP Concessions appropriately cater for the needs of prospective foreign investors. The efficacy and appropriateness of the VCLP Concessions from a policy perspective is also examined. Recommendations are provided which, if enacted, would address regions of structural inconsistency and improve the functioning of this concessional regime.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum interaction phenomena in p-GaAs microelectronic devices</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Warrick Robin, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this dissertation, we study properties of quantum interaction phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) electronic systems in p-GaAs micro- and nano-scale devices.

The novel SISFETs feature in our studies of the metallic behavior in 2D systems in which we examine temperature corrections to  ????xx(T) and ????xy(T) in short- and long-range disorder potentials.

We explore the evolution of this quantum Hall state as the relative densities in the layers is imbalanced while the total density is kept constant.

Catholic Church documents specifically state primary parental responsibility for their children???s religious education. Catholic schools were established to inculcate faith, and assist parents??? role. This thesis asks, to what extent that role has been realised? It unravels the processes that determined and defined the changing role of Catholic parents during this period, and identifies significant shifts in institutional thinking and practices related to parents and resultant shifts in cultural and social perceptions. After half a century of conformity and comfort, a significant era followed as the Australian Church responded to challenges, including financial crisis for Catholic schools, reform in the Australian education system, and the impact of the Second Vatican Council. Cohorts from three generations were selected. Interviews and focus groups elicited memories that were recorded and analysed, in terms of the integral questions; the role and involvement of parents in Catholic schools. Participants recalled their own childhood in Catholic schools and, where applicable, as parents educating their own children, or as religious teachers. The analysis was theoretically informed by the work of Durkheim, Greeley, Coleman and Bourdieu. A review of Church documents and commentaries through the twentieth century, bearing on the education of children, showed the official Church position. Despite numerous rhetorical statements issued by Catholic authorities, emphasising the role of parents as ???primary educators???, the practical responses ranged from active encouragement to dismissal. Teachers in Catholic schools and related bureaucracies were, seemingly, reluctant to initiate a more inclusive partnership role. Gradually, and in a piecemeal fashion, the Catholic Church and its schools have been responding to growing parental consciousness of their role and responsibilities.  A significant shift was signalled by the New South Wales Bishops in establishing the Council of Catholic School Parents, to be supported by a full-time, salaried Executive Officer, in 2003. But any accommodation to new understandings of parent/teacher, or family/school relation is complex and not to be oversimplified as a simple sharing, or ceding of authority.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic schools -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church -- Education -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Religious education -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Education -- Parent participation -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Parent-teacher relationships -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Home and school -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian analysis of rainfall-runoff models: insights to parameter estimation, model comparison and hierarchical model development</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Lucy Amanda, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">One challenge that faces hydrologists in water resources planning is to predict the catchment???s response to a given rainfall. Estimation of parameter uncertainty (and model uncertainty) allows assessment of the risk in likely applications of hydrological models. Bayesian statistical inference, with computations carried out via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, offers an attractive approach to model specification, allowing for the combination of any pre-existing knowledge about individual models and their respective parameters with the available catchment data to assess both parameter and model uncertainty. This thesis develops and applies Bayesian statistical tools for parameter estimation, comparison of model performance and hierarchical model aggregation. The work presented has three main sections. The first area of research compares four MCMC algorithms for simplicity, ease of use, efficiency and speed of implementation in the context of conceptual rainfall-runoff modelling. Included is an adaptive Metropolis algorithm that has characteristics that are well suited to hydrological applications. The utility of the proposed adaptive algorithm is further expanded by the second area of research in which a probabilistic regime for comparing selected models is developed and applied. The final area of research introduces a methodology for hydrologic model aggregation that is flexible and dynamic. Rigidity in the model structure limits representation of the variability in the flow generation mechanism, which becomes a limitation when the flow processes are not clearly understood. The proposed Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts (HME) model architecture is designed to do away with this limitation by selecting individual models probabilistically based on predefined catchment indicators. In addition, the approach allows a more flexible specification of the model error to better assess the risk of likely outcomes based on the model simulations. Application of the approach to lumped and distributed rainfall runoff models for a variety of catchments shows that by assessing different catchment predictors the method can be a useful tool for prediction of catchment response.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrology</field><field name="subject">rainfall runoff model</field><field name="subject">Bayesian</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling dependent risks for insurer risk management: experimental studies with copulas</field><field name="creator">Wu, Mei Lan, Actuarial Studies, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The increase in the use of copulas has introduced implementation issues for both practitioners and researchers. One of the issues is to obtain a copula function for a given set of data. The most common approaches for the estimation of the parameters of the copula functions have been the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and the Inference Functions for Margins (IFM) methods. Archimedean copulas are one of the most important classes of copulas that are widely used in both finance and insurance for modelling dependent risks. However, simulating multivariate Archimedean copulas has always been a difficult task as the number of dimensions increases. The assessment of capital requirements has always been an important application of stochastic modelling. Capital requirements can vary significantly depending on the model adopted. Several professional bodies have recently discussed the concept of dependencies between insurance risks. They suggest that insurers should use a technique based on copulas to describe the dependence of risks within an insurance company in the context of solvency assessment. The first contribution of this thesis is to provide an insight into the efficiency of parameter estimation methods. This thesis uses numerical experiments to assess the performance of the two common approaches. The second contribution of this thesis is to present a new algorithm to simulate multivariate Exchangeable Archimedean copulas. This algorithm provides a practical solution for simulating one-parameter multivariate Archimedean copulas. Numerical experiments are used to apply this algorithm to determine the "additional" economic capital for an insurance company with multiple lines of business that wants to expand its business by adding another line of business and where the businesses are dependent. The third contribution of this thesis is to quantify the impact of the choice of copulas on the solvency measure of a general insurer within a Dynamic Financial Analysis modelling framework. The results of our experiments provide important guidance for the capital assessment for general insurers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dependence modelling.</field><field name="subject">Copulas.</field><field name="subject">Risk (Insurance)</field><field name="subject">Insurance -- Mathematics.</field><field name="subject">Risk management.</field><field name="subject">Risk (Insurance) -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating norms, navigating care: the practice of culturally competent care in cardiac rehabilitation</field><field name="creator">Haghshenas, Abbas, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND Increasingly, it is recognised that the unique needs of people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (CaLDB) should be addressed within a framework of cultural competence. To date, there are limited data on the issues facing CaLDB patients in the Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) setting. Appreciation of an individual???s values, attitudes and beliefs underpins negotiation of behaviour change in the CR setting. Therefore an understanding of patient and professional interactions is of key importance. OBJECTIVES The focus of this study has been to undertake an exploration of CR service delivery to people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, using Arabic speaking people as an exemplar of a CaLDB group. More broadly, this research project has sought to identify factors, which influence the practice of health professionals towards CaLDB patients, and to develop a model for evaluation of culturally competent health care in the CR setting. The study sought to achieve these aims by addressing the following research questions: 1. In what way do health practitioners in CR adjust their treatment and support to accommodate the perceived needs of CaLDB communities? 2. In what way do factors (such as individual and organisation perspectives) influence the adjustment of clinical practice and service delivery of CR practitioners; and what are practitioners??? and patients??? perception of barriers and facilitators to service delivery? 3. To what level are CaLDB patients satisfied with CR services? This study design is comprised of the following elements: (1) interviews with health practitioners and Arabic speaking background patients as an exemplar of CaLDB patients; (2) review of policy and procedure documents and medical records; and (3) field observation.  METHOD This thesis embraces a qualitative approach as the primary method of investigation to align with the exploratory and descriptive nature of the study. The main methods used in the study were: in depth interviews with health professionals and patients; field observations; appraisal of relevant documents and consultation with expert panels. Study samples were selected through a purposive sampling strategy.Data were analysed using the method of content analysis, guided by the research questions. FINDINGS In total, 25 health professionals (20 female and 5 male) and 32 patients (21 male and 11 female) were interviewed. The method of qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis. Data analysis revealed four major themes: 1) The challenging context; 2) Tuning practices; 3) Influencing factors; and 4) Goodness of fit. The study demonstrated a challenging context for CR delivery, both from the perspective of patients and health professionals. Data reveal a process of reflection, negotiation, and navigation of care by CR health professionals in an effort to understand and meet the diverse needs of CALDB patients. CONCLUSION On the basis of the study findings, a process-oriented model of tuning practice to achieve cultural competence in CR delivery is proposed to inform policy, research and clinical practice.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases -- Patients -- Rehabilitation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Health services accessibility -- Cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Transcultural medical care</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases -- Prevention -- Needs assessment -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An automated micro-grinding system for the fabrication of precision micro-scale profiles</field><field name="creator">Milton, Gareth Edward, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Production of micro-scale components is an important emergent field. One underdeveloped area is the production of micro-scale 3D surfaces, which has important applications in micro-optics and fibre optic sensors. One particular application is the production of micro-lenses. With scales of less than 200 ??m these lenses can improve light coupling efficiencies in micro-optic systems. However, current lens production techniques have limitations in accuracy and versatility. Creating these surfaces through mechanical micro-grinding has the potential to improve the precision and variety of profiles that can be produced, thus improving transmission efficiencies and leading to new applications. This work presents a novel micro-grinding method for the production of microscale asymmetric, symmetric and axisymmetric curved components from brittle materials such as glasses. A specialised micro-grinding machine and machining system has been designed, constructed and successfully tested and is presented here. This system is capable of producing complex profiles directly on the tips of optical fibre workpieces. A five degree of freedom centring system is presented that can align and rotate these workpieces about a precision axis, enabling axisymmetric grinding. A machine vision system, utilising a microscope lens system and sub-pixel localisation techniques, is used to provide feedback for the process, image processing techniques are presented which are shown to have a sensing resolution of 300 nm. Using these systems, workpieces are centred to within 500 nm. Tools are mounted on nanometre precise motion stages and motion and infeed are controlled. Tooling configurations with flat and tangential grinding surfaces are presented along with control and path generation algorithms. The capabilities and shortcomings of each are presented along with methods to predict appropriate feed rates based on experimental data. Both asymmetric and axisymmetric flat and curved micro-profiles have been produced on the tips of optical fibres using this system.

Novel results of dynamic wetting behaviour by the sessile drop method were obtained under strongly reducing atmosphere (oxygen partial pressure 10-20 -- 10-18 atm).  Terminal contact angles (after 240 min) for MS slag were: for iron substrates -5??2??(1350??C), 9+-2?? (1390??C), 6+-2 (1450??C); nickel -- 3+-2??(1350 and 1390??C); and platinum --15+-2??(1350 and 1390??C), 12+-2??(1450??C).  Contact angles with CAS slag were: iron -- 55+-2??(1350??C), 60+-2?? (1390??C), 44+-2?? (1450??C); nickel -- 59+-2??(1350??C), 60+-2?? (1390??C); and platinum -- 15+-2?? (1350, 1390 and 1450??C).  Values for interfacial tension, work of adhesion, spreading parameter (S) and interaction coefficient (&#1060;) were also determined. Work of adhesion for all three substrates with MS slag changed in a very narrow range 910 - 930 mJ/m2. Interfacial tension with this slag was 1,480 mN/m for Ni at 1350-1390??C, and 1,880-1,890 mN/m for Pt in the temperature range 1,350-1,450??C. For iron, interfacial tension was 1,720 mN/m at 1350??C (&#947;-Fe); it decreased to 1590-1580 mN/m with increasing temperature to 1390 and 1450??C (&#61540;-Fe).  Lower work of adhesion and higher interfacial tension was found for metals with CAS slag.  Wetting properties of Pt substrate with MS slag were close to that with CAS slag, while Fe and Ni substrates showed better wetting by MS slag in comparison with CAS slag. This was attributed to higher reactivity of Fe and Ni with MS slag, particularly reduction of MnO. Although MnO was also reduced in reaction with Pt, oxygen adsorption in contact with both slags was a major factor governing wettability of Pt.  Dissolution of manganese in nickel and platinum substrates at elevated temperatures modified the interface chemistry, causing formation of a liquid alloy phase. Degree of silica reduction from MS slag was much smaller in comparison with MnO reduction (negligible for Pt); it was very minor from CAS slag. Concentration profiles of Mn and Si across the interface and along the metal surface were used to estimate diffusion coefficients. Diffusion along metal surfaces was generally higher by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude than across the interface.  Reduction of oxides and adsorption of oxygen modify the metal-oxide interface, making wetting dynamic. They have a profound on interfacial properties.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wettability.</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="subject">Nickel.</field><field name="subject">Platinum.</field><field name="subject">Manganese silicate.</field><field name="subject">Calcium aluminosilicate.</field><field name="subject">Surface tension.</field><field name="subject">Surface chemistry.</field><field name="subject">Adhesion.</field><field name="subject">Contact angle.</field><field name="subject">Steel -- Inclusions.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the early interactions between vaccinia virus and dendritic cells - towards an enhanced vaccine vector.</field><field name="creator">Dunstan, Kerrie, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the post smallpox era, vaccinia virus (VACV) has emerged as an important candidate vaccine vector. As yet, the binding receptors and entry mechanisms utilised by the two infectious forms, IMV and EEV, in dendritic cells (DCs) are unknown. We have investigated the interactions between VACV and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that are known to be utilised by many other viruses for binding and entry in DCs. Using a variety of CLR ligands and inhibitors we were unable to inhibit IMV or EEV binding to MDDCs and we conclude that they do not bind to CLRs. We have also investigated VACV entry in MDDCs and show that both IMV and EEV enter MDDCs via an endocytic pathway. Using a variety of drugs that inhibit cellular processes we found IMV and EEV entry to be actin- and calcium-dependent. EEV entry was also cholesterol- and energy-dependent, whereas IMV entry was only partially dependent on these factors. Both IMV and EEV colocalised with endolysosomal markers. This data suggests that EEV may enter DCs via caveolin-mediated endocytosis whereas IMV entry can occur via multiple complementary mechanisms, including endocytosis and fusion. Macropinocytosis may also constitute a minor route of entry for IMV as entry was partially inhibited by dimethyl amiloride and the virus colocalised with dextran. Finally we have provided a comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression at the protein level in MDDCs and monocyte-derived Langerhans cells (MDLCs) as models for different myeloid DC subsets. We found TLR expression to be cell type-specific and MDDCs expressed the full repertoire of TLRs 1-9, including small amounts of TLR8 and TLR9 on the cell surface. The expression of these TLRs that recognise nucleic acids on the surface of cells may constitute an early warning system for signalling the presence of viral invaders that would normally subvert the function of DCs. We also found TLR expression in mature cells to be dependent on the nature of the maturation stimulus (lipopolysaccharide versus cytokine/prostaglandin cocktail) and VACV infection induced profound down-regulation of all TLRs. These findings will have important implications for the rational design of VACV-vectored vaccines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vaccinia virus.</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cells.</field><field name="subject">C-type lectin receptors.</field><field name="subject">Endocytosis.</field><field name="subject">Toll-like receptors.</field><field name="subject">Vaccines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving broadcast performance in multi-radio multi-channel multi-rate wireless mesh networks.</field><field name="creator">Qadir, Junaid, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of `efficient' broadcast in a multi-radio multi-channel multi-rate wireless mesh network (MR$^2$-MC WMN). In such a MR$^2$-MC WMN, nodes are equipped with multiple radio network interface cards, each tuned to an orthogonal channel, that can dynamically adjust transmission rate by choosing a modulation scheme appropriate for the channel conditions. We choose `broadcast latency', defined as the maximum delay between a packet's network-wide broadcast at the source and its eventual reception at all network nodes, as the `efficiency' metric of broadcast performance. The problem of constructing a broadcast forwarding structure having minimal broadcast latency is referred to as the `minimum-latency-broadcasting' (MLB) problem.  While previous research for broadcast in single-radio single-rate wireless networks has highlighted the wireless medium's `\emph{wireless broadcast advantage}' (WBA); little is known regarding how the new features of MR$^2$-MC WMN may be exploited. We study in this thesis how the availability of multiple radio interfaces (tuned to orthogonal channels) at WMN nodes, and WMN's multi-rate transmission capability and WBA, might be exploited to improve the `broadcast latency' performance. We show the MLB problem for MR$^2$-MC WMN to be NP-hard, and resort to heuristics for its solution. We divide the overall problem into two sub-problems, which we address in two separate parts of this thesis. \emph{In the first part of this thesis}, the MLB problem is defined for the case of single-radio single-channel multi-rate WMNs  where WMN nodes are equipped with a single radio tuned to a common channel. \emph{In the second part of this thesis}, the MLB problem is defined for MR$^2$-MC WMNs where WMN nodes are equipped with multiple radios tuned to multiple orthogonal channels. We demonstrate that broadcasting in multi-rate WMNs is significantly different to broadcasting in single-rate WMNs, and that broadcast performance in multi-rate WMNs can be significantly improved by exploiting the availability of multi-rate feature and multiple interfaces. We also present two alternative MLB broadcast frameworks and specific algorithms, centralized and distributed, for each framework that can exploit multiple interfaces at a WMN node, and the multi-rate feature and WBA of MR$^2$-MC WMN to return improved `broadcast latency' performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broadcasting</field><field name="subject">routing</field><field name="subject">multi-radio</field><field name="subject">multi-channel</field><field name="subject">multi-rate</field><field name="subject">wireless mesh networks</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A working man???s hell: working class men's experiences with work in the Australian imperial force during the Great War</field><field name="creator">Wise, Nathan, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Historical analyses of soldiers in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the Great War have focused overwhelming on combat experiences and the environment of the trenches. By contrast, little consideration has been made of the non-combat experiences of these individuals, or of the time they spent behind the front lines. Far from military experiences revolving around combat and trench warfare, the letters, diaries, and memoirs of working class men suggest that daily life for the rank and file actually revolved around work, and in particular manual labour. Through a focus on working class men???s experiences in the AIF during the Great War, this dissertation seeks to discover more about these experiences with work in an attempt to understand the broader aspects of life in the military. In this environment of daily work, many working class men also came to approach military service as a job of work, and they carried over the mentalities of the civilian workplace into their daily life in the military. This dissertation thus seeks to understand how workplace cultures were transferred from civilian workplaces into the military. It explores working class men???s approaches towards daily work in two different theatres of war, Gallipoli and the Western Front, in order to highlight the significance of work within military life. Furthermore, it evaluates aspects of this workplace culture, such as relations with employers, the use of workplace skills, and the implementation of industrial relations methods, to understand the continuities between the lives of civilians and soldiers. Finally, this dissertation is not a military history: it adopts a culturalist approach towards the lives of people in the AIF, and in the environment of the Great War, in an effort to place the military experiences of these working class men within the context of their broader civilian lives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Working class men -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Soldiers -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- History, Military.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio compression and speech enhancement using temporal masking models</field><field name="creator">Gunawan, Teddy Surya, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Of the few existing models of temporal masking applicable to problems such as compression and enhancement, none are based on empirical data from the psychoacoustic literature, presumably because the multidimensional nature of the data makes the derivation of tractable functional models difficult. This thesis presents two new functional models of the temporal masking effect of the human auditory system, and their exploitation in audio compression and speech enhancement applications. Traditional audio compression algorithms do not completely utilise the temporal masking properties of the human auditory system, relying solely on simultaneous masking models. A perceptual wavelet packet-based audio coder has been devised that incorporates the first developed temporal masking model and combined with simultaneous masking models in a novel manner. An evaluation of the coder using both objective (PEAQ, ITU-R BS.1387) and extensive subjective tests (ITU-R BS.1116) revealed a bitrate reduction of more than 17% compared with existing simultaneous masking-based audio coders, while preserving transparent quality. In addition, the oversampled wavelet packet transform (ODWT) has been newly applied to obtain alias-free coefficients for more accurate masking threshold calculation. Finally, a low-complexity scalable audio coding algorithm using the ODWT-based thresholds and temporal masking has been investigated. Currently, there is a strong need for innovative speech enhancement algorithms exploiting the auditory masking effects of human auditory system that perform well at very low signal-to-noise ratio. Existing competitive noise suppression algorithms and those that incorporate simultaneous masking were examined and evaluated for their suitability as baseline algorithms. Objective measures using PESQ (ITU-T P.862) and subjective measures (ITU-T P.835) demonstrate that the proposed enhancement scheme, based on a second new masking model, outperformed the seven baseline speech enhancement methods by at least 6- 20% depending on the SNR. Hence, the proposed speech enhancement scheme exploiting temporal masking effects has good potential across many types and intensities of environmental noise.

Unlike spreadsheets, word processing software and email, these products are not designed to provide efficiency improvements. Rather, online legal knowledge products, which package and apply the law, were and are viewed by many as having the potential to make major changes to legal practice. Many used the term &amp;quitrevolution&amp;quot to describe the anticipated impact. Like any new technology development, many intersecting factors contributed to their development. In many ways they built on existing uses of technology in legal practice. The various information technology paradigms which underpin them - text retrieval, expert systems/artificial intelligence, document automation, computer aided instruction (CAI) and hypertext - were already a part of the &amp;quotcomputerisation of law&amp;quot. What is new about online legal knowledge products is that as well as using technology paradigms such as expert systems or document automation to package and apply the law, they are developed using browser-based technologies. In this way they leverage the comparative ease of development and distribution capabilities of the Internet (and/or intranets). There has been particular interest in the impact of online legal knowledge products on the legal services provided to large commercial organisations. With the increasing burden of corporate compliance, expanding role of the in-house lawyer and pressure to curb costs, online legal knowledge products should flourish in commercial organisations and many have been adamant that they will. However, there is no convincing evidence that anything like a &amp;quotrevolution&amp;quot has taken place. Success stories are few and far between. Surprisingly few have asked whether this &amp;quotrevolution&amp;quot has failed, or seriously analysed whether it lies ahead. If it does lie ahead, what factors, if any, need to taken into account in order for it to take place? If there is to be no revolution, what value should be placed on online legal knowledge products? In this dissertation I use the findings of my own empirical work, supported by a literature survey, to demonstrate that the impact of online legal knowledge products has been modest. I argue that in order to build successful online legal knowledge products it is necessary to appreciate that a complex system of interacting factors underpins their development and use,and address those factors. I propose a schematic representation of the relationships involved in producing an online legal knowledge product and use the findings of some empirical work, together with a review the literature in related fields, to identify the factors relevant to the various components of this framework. While there are many interacting factors at play, four sets of considerations emerge from my research as particularly important: integrating different technology paradigms, knowledge acquisition, usability, and implementation. As a practical matter, the implication of these findings is that some online legal knowledge products are more likely to be successful than others, and that there are other technology applications that may represent a better investment of the limited in-house technology budget than many online legal knowledge products. I also argue that while most of the challenges involved in integrating different technology paradigms, improving usability, and effective implementation can be addressed with varying levels of effort, the problem of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck is intractable. New approaches to knowledge acquisition are required to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. I identify some potential approaches that emerge from my research: automation, collaboration and coalition, phasing and simple solutions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legal services.</field><field name="subject">Law -- Information services.</field><field name="subject">Law -- Computer network resources.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second skin: exploring perceptions of contemporaryknitting.</field><field name="creator">Clifton-Cunningham, Alana, Design Studies, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using written and studio research, the above research question is interrogated through a body of practical work, that evolved into a static exhibition titled Second skin: new knitting at The Ivan Dougherty Gallery, Paddington, New South Wales, Australia, in January/February 2008. This thesis examines knitting as a form of constructed textile in an historical and contemporary context and explores the integral relationship it has with fashion and textiles, as well as questioning the significance of interplay between fashion and art. The primary aim of this research is to explore contemporary knitwear designers working in the high-fashion&#146; area of design and investigate how they are challenging traditionally established rules and perceptions, and potentially blur the boundaries of what is considered fashion design, into art. While conceptual fashion design has always been a debateable issue among fashion scholars as to whether it can be viewed as fashion, antifashion or possibly art, this thesis examines the influences of modernity and deconstruction in relation to knitting, to establish a conclusion regarding the contemporary position and understanding of knitting in society at present. Through gathering both primary and secondary research nationally and internationally, knitting has been examined in relation to the ways in which contemporary designers working in the realm of knitting are unravelling these traditionally based preconceptions, and analysing what they are accomplishing through the use of mixed media applications, post-knitting treatments, yarn and stitch manipulation, and challenging sculptural form to create a new visual language through artisanal production. The body of work presented explores the concepts established in the written research relative to perception and deconstruction, and provokes questions which challenge the notion of knitting as fashion, art or both. Through hand and machine knitting techniques, Second skin: new knitting examines body scarification in the form of tribal markings, which allows each pieces to transform into a second skin that convey interpretive narratives and visual messages. The predominant medium utilised is 100% Australian wool and in conjunction, incorporates mixed media materials such as silk organza and semi precious stones, and technological processes include laser cutting and etching of Tasmanian oak veneer and leather.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Death among a cohort of prisoners in New South Wales Australia ??? a data linkage study</field><field name="creator">Kariminia, Azar, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines mortality rates among adults who experienced full-time imprisonment in New South Wales between January 1988 and December 2002, by record linkage to the Australian National Death Index. The cohort included 76383 men and 8820 women. Over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 5137 deaths (4724 men, 423 women) were identified. Three hundred and three deaths (295 men, eight women) occurred in custody. The median age at death was 36.6 years for men and 32.7 years for women. The prominent causes of death were drug overdose, suicide, accidental and cardiovascular disease. The crude mortality rate was 797 per 100000 person-years for men and 685 per 100000 person-years for women. Risk of mortality was 3.7 times greater in male and 7.8 times greater in female prisoners than the standard population. The excess mortality was substantially raised following release from prison in both men (standardised mortality ratio 4.0 vs 1.7) and women (standardised mortality ratio 8.2 vs 2.1). The period of highest risk of death was the first two weeks after release. Drug overdose was the main cause of death, responsible for 68% of the deaths in the first two weeks for men and for 90% of the deaths in this period for women. In men, there was also a clustering of suicide directly after release. Prisoners admitted to prison psychiatric hospital, repeat offenders and those in the early stage of followup were at increased risk of mortality. Violent offenders were overrepresented in suicide figures and property offenders in death from overdose. Minority groups, in particular men, had a lower risk of death than white people. The above findings reinforce how disadvantaged prisoners are, measured by mortality as the most fundamental scale of human wellbeing. Prison represents a potential opportunity for treatment and public health intervention to address some of the health problems underlying the high mortality found in this study. The key challenge is, however, to provide a continuum of care between the prison and community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prisoners -- New South Wales -- Mortality</field><field name="subject">Prisoners -- New South Wales -- Death</field><field name="subject">Prisoners -- New South Wales -- Statistics</field><field name="subject">Prisoners -- Suicidal behavior -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Prisoners -- Rehabilitation -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quasiparticle dynamics in a single cooper-pair transistor.</field><field name="creator">Court, Nadia A., Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of single Cooper-pair transistor (SCPT) for fast and sensitive detection of quasiparticle dynamics. This investigation is motivated by the possibility of quantum information processing using superconducting nanoscale circuits, such as the SCPT and the Cooper-pair-box (CPB). In the SCPT coherent charge transport can be temporarily halted due to quasiparticle tunnelling, known as quasiparticle poisoning. Quasiparticle poisoning can be reduced by the use of engineered island and lead gap energies. The thesis begins by reporting measurements of the superconducting gap in aluminium - aluminium-oxide - aluminium tunnel junctions, as a function of film thickness. We have observed an increase in the superconducting energy gap of aluminium with decreasing film thickness. This method is used to engineer the island and gap energies in a SCPT and consequently we observe reduced poisoning and a modification of the thresholds for finite bias transport processes. Radio-frequency reflectometry is used to perform high-bandwidth measurements of quasiparticle tunnelling in a gap engineered SCPT. A model for the radio-frequency (rf) operation of the SCPT is presented and shows close agreement with experiment. Thermal activation of the quasiparticle dynamics is investigated, and consequently, we are able to determine energetics of the poisoning and unpoisoning processes. This enables an effective quasiparticle temperature to be determined, allowing the poisoning to be parametrised. An investigation of the use of normal metal quasiparticle traps for suppression of quasiparticle poisoning in SCPT devices is performed. To date, there has been little quantitative information about the behaviour of quasiparticle traps even though they have been used extensively. The work presented serves to clarify the nature of quasiparticle trap performance. Finally the single-quasiparticle sensitivity of the SCPT is employed to directly probe a few quasiparticle gas in a small superconducting volume. The quasiparticle population is monitored both in the steady-state and under non-equilibrium conditions of injection. In the non-equilibrium regime the quasiparticle recombination time is accessed from the response of the SCPT to pulsed injection. Agreement to previous experimental studies of recombination times in aluminium is found.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quasiparticle poisoning</field><field name="subject">single Cooper-pair transistor</field><field name="subject">Quasiparticles (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Contribution of Carl Czerny to Piano Pedagogy in the Early Nineteenth Century.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Ki Tak Katherine, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Carl Czerny (1791-1857), whose works number over one thousand opuses, had an active career a composer, pianist, exponent of Beethoven, piano teacher, and theorist. He has received lots of criticism both during his lifetime and ever since. Even nowadays, though many of his piano exercises are popular items for many teachers and pupils ranging from beginners to virtuosi, Czerny is still rated as a master of mechanical works that focus mainly on the right hand. This study will argue that Czerny is much underrated, particularly as a pedagogue, and aims to find out what are the underlying principles that Czerny embedded in his piano pedagogical works, what made them indispensable in the teaching of piano playing and to what degree they present other musical elements which are not purely mechanical in order to reassess Czerny?s achievements in the field of piano pedagogy. The discussion is based on the original English edition of Czerny?s Opus 500 Complete Theoretical and Practical Piano Forte School (1839), its Supplement, as well as Czerny?s other pedagogical works, such as Op. 139, Op. 299, Op. 365, Op. 755 and Op. 821. In addition, other selected pedagogical works and representative keyboard method books and exercises (excluding works for the organ) by other authors up to Czerny?s time are discussed for enriching the discussion. Through a detailed analysis of Czerny?s Opus 500, this study identifies fifteen parameters in his teaching sequences that range from beginner to virtuoso and the findings are clarified and contextualized within the field of 19th century piano pedagogy. These fifteen parameters are also exemplified in four selected opuses of Czerny, and through the ?Exam Pieces? of The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. These are used to justify the applicability of the parameters in the learning sequences intrinsic to the graded piano qualifying examinations nowadays. It is argued that in view of the rich pedagogical content of Czerny?s work both technically and stylistically, together with the systematic teaching sequences that he presented in his piano pedagogical works, Czerny?s contribution to the art of keyboard playing should be well acknowledged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Czerny, Carl, 1791-1857</field><field name="subject">Piano -- Instruction and study -- History and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the key determinants in up-scaling undifferentiated growth of human embryonic stem cells in bioreactor systems</field><field name="creator">Prowse, Andrew Benjamin James, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human Embryonic Stem (hES) cells will potentially have important applications in regenerative medicine, drug discovery and therapeutics. However, the current methods of hES cell culture limit their use in future applications due mostly to the inability to culture undifferentiated hES cells in sufficient numbers and the concern of animal derived products used in culture methods potentially implementing an immune rejection in transplantiation recipients. This project investigated two approaches for improving the culture of undifferentiated hES cells for future application in bioreactor systems. Firstly, proteins from the conditioned medium of three hES cell supportive fibroblast lines (human fetal, human neonatal and mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were identified using two-dimensional liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry. This proteomic analysis identified 175 unique proteins including those from key pathways already implicated in the maintenance of human embryonic stem cell pluripotency including the Wnt, BMP/TGF-&#946;1, activin/inhibin and insulin like growth factor-1 pathways. Identification of proteins in fibroblast conditioned medium will aid the development of a defined medium for undifferentiated hES cell culture. The second approach examined culture of hES cells in hypoxic conditions (5% O2) compared to standard normoxic conditions in CO2 incubators (20% O2). Feeder layer and feeder free culture conditions were examined in the two O2 concentrations. hES cell colonies grown in hypoxic culture had improved percentages of pluripotent cells (judged by increases in cells expressing SSEA-4, Tra-1-60 and nanog and reduction of BMP-4), stable karyotypes and increased proliferation. The maintenance of pluripotency, apoptosis and proliferation was complicated by the detection of the cell surface marker CD30. Proteomic identification and investigation into oxidative stress indicated the presence of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases, catalases and peroxiredoxins in human fetal fibroblast conditioned medium and their regulation of redox homeostasis may play a significant role in the maintenance of hES cell pluripotency, apoptosis and proliferation. Together these investigations significantly contribute to the current body of knowledge for the undifferentiated culture of hES cells. Identification of conditioned medium proteins and the benefits of hypoxic culture of hES cells will aid the development of a defined, reproducible method of hES cell scale-up in bioreactor systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and extinction of Southeast Asia&#146;s Megafauna</field><field name="creator">Louys, Julien, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Quaternary megafauna of Southeast Asia are among the world&#146;s poorest known. Throughout the Pleistocene, continental collisions, active volcanic systems and fluctuations in sea level have had dramatic effects on the region's geography, from southern China to Indonesia. Many Southeast Asian megafauna experienced geographical range reduction or complete extinction during that interval. This thesis explores the relative influence of environmental change and human interaction in these extinctions. There is currently no direct evidence to suggest that humans had a negative impact on Southeast Asian megafauna until the Holocene. Rather, extinctions and geographical range reduction experienced by megafauna are likely to have resulted from of loss of suitable habitats, in particular the loss of more open habitats. Environmental change throughout the Pleistocene of Southeast Asia is reconstructed on the basis of discriminant functions analysis of megafauna from twenty-seven Southeast Asian Quaternary sites, as well as Gongwangling, an early Pleistocene hominin site previously interpreted as paleoarctic. The discriminant functions were defined on the basis of species lists drawn from modern Asian nature reserves and national parks, and were analysed using both taxonomic and phylogeny-free variables. Biases present in these species lists were mitigated against using a range of multivariate techniques. The reconstructions show that Pleistocene environments in Southeast Asia varied from open (e.g. savannah), mixed (woodland) and closed (e.g. rainforest) habitats. Changes in habitats through time are likely to have been driven, at least in part, by changes in sea-level, in turn related to oscillations between glacial and interglacial conditions. The environmental changes associated with these oscillations are likely to have adversely affected many of Southeast Asia&#146;s megafauna. The Toba super-eruption (~74kya) is unlikely to have been responsible for any of the megafauna extinctions of the Late Pleistocene.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living free radical and photo initiation studies of acrylate, methacrylate and itaconate polymerization systems</field><field name="creator">Szablan, Zachary Peter, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis work has focused on the study of itaconate monomers and photo-initiation processes in acrylate, methacrylate and itaconate monomer systems. Novel information pertaining to photo-initiator derived radical species and their reactivity, as well as the behaviour of itaconate polymerization systems is presented in detail. The knowledge gained from the photo-initiation studies is utilized as a precursor to mark polymer chains using nitrones as radical spin traps and the applicability of this technique discussed. The sterically hindered monomers dimethyl itaconate (DMI), di-n-butyl itaconate (DBI) and dicyclohexyl itaconate (DCHI) were polymerized via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) free radical polymerization. The RAFT mediated polymerization of these monomers displayed hybrid living behaviour (a mix of conventional and living free radical polymerization characteristics) of varying degrees depending on the molecular structure of the RAFT agent employed. DCHI was also polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The resulting molecular weight distributions are broad for the RAFT mediated systems (1.2 &#8804; PDI &#8804; 3.4). The molecular weight distributions generated via the ATRP of DCHI are narrower (1.2 &#8804; PDI &#8804; 1.5). Chain transfer to monomer constants for the itaconate monomers DMI, DBI and DCHI have been determined at 60 ??C (CDMI = 1.4&#8901;10-3, CDBI = 1.3&#8901;10-3 and CDCHI = 1.0&#8901;10-3) and are relatively large in comparison to similar 1,1-disubstituted systems, suggesting that the transfer to monomer reaction is significant. PREDICI?? simulations confirm that a significant chain transfer to monomer step results in broad molecular weight distributions. Viscosity of the polymerizing system has also been shown to be an important factor in the resulting width of the molecular weight distributions. Chain extension of RAFT capped pDCHI and pDBI yield molecular weight distributions that progressively shift to higher molecular weights. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of pDCHI-block-pStyrene copolymers indicates thermal degradation in two separate steps for the pDCHI and pStyrene blocks.     Conventional pulsed laser polymerization coupled with size exclusion chromatography (PLP-SEC) as well as multi-pulse pulsed laser polymerization (MP-PLP) has been employed to study the depropagation kinetics of DMI, DBI DCHI and di(4-tert butylcyclohexyl) itaconate (DBCHI). The effective rate coefficient of propagation, kp eff, was determined for DMI, DBI and DCHI in bulk and solution of cyclohexanone (DCHI), N-methylformamide (DMI and DBI) and anisole (DBCHI) for monomer concentrations between 0.7 &amp;lt cM 0 &amp;lt 7.1 mol L-1 in a wide temperature range (0 &amp;lt T &amp;lt 90 ??C). The resulting Arrhenius plots (i.e. ln kp eff vs. 1/RT) displayed a significant curvature in the higher temperature regimes and were analyzed in their respective linear and curved sections to yield the activation parameters of the forward and reverse reaction. Mark-Houwink-Kahn Sakurada parameters for pDBI and pDBCHI were determined in tetrahydrofuran at 40 ??C using triple detection gel permeatation chromatography. High resolution Electrospray Ionization - Quadrupole Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry (ESIMS) was applied to study the polymeric product spectrum generated by the pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA), methyl acrylate (MA), butyl acrylate (BA) and DMI at temperatures &#8804; 0 ??C in the presence of various photo-initiators including 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA), benzoin, benzil, benzoin ethyl ether (BEE) 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and bis(2,4,6-trimethyl-benzoyl)- phenylphosphinoxide (Irgacure 819) to study the reactivity of primary and potential secondary derived radical fragments from photolytically induced fragmentation. Termination products, both combination and disproportionation, were identified with high accuracy. Results have been compiled in a user friendly table presenting the reactivity of the various photolysis product fragments towards the different monomers. Energy deposition into the MA/photo-initiator systems is found to have no influence on the product distributions of the MA polymers produced via photo-initiation under the conditions examined. For various photo-initiators employed, products congruent to that of chain transfer to monomer species in the DMI photo-polymerizations are observed, conclusively illustrating that chain transfer to monomer is a significant reaction pathway in itaconate    free radical polymerizations. Both the benzoyl and acetal fragments generated as a result of DMPA photo cleavage were found to initiate and highly likely terminate polymerization. Under the conditions studied, the acetal radical produced upon DMPA photolysis fragment further to yield methyl radicals which seem to act predominantly as terminating moieties. Both the benzoyl and ether fragments produced as a result of benzoin photo cleavage were found to act as initiating and probable terminating species, indicating that the ether radical fragment does not act exclusively as a terminating species. Additionally, increasing laser intensity and/or irradiation repetition rate (i.e., energy deposition into the system) results in more complex product distributions of the MMA polymers produced via photo-initiation (with the exception of AIBN). Temperature was determined to have a minor influence on the resulting product distribution under the conditions examined. Polymerization systems utilizing Irgacure 819 give complex product spectra due to the formation of second generation radical species resulting in several initiator fragments incorporated into a single polymer chain. A novel method utilizing PLP in free radical polymerization has been developed for marking of polymer chains with radical spin traps. By introducing a so-called &#147;marker&#148; (nitroxide derived from a nitrone), which specifically terminates propagating radicals via combination, a polymer subdistribution is generated which can be measured by ESI-MS and may potentially be utilized to determine propagation rate coefficients of ultimate accuracy. The general methodology of the technique in which such marker radicals are generated via reaction of an initiating radical with a nitrone is demonstrated on the examples of butyl acrylate (BA) and vinyl acetate (VAc).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">There's always more: the art of David McDiarmid</field><field name="creator">Gray, Sally Suzette Clelland, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the work of the artist David McDiarmid is to be read as an enactment of late twentieth century gay male and queer politics.

An attempt has been made to address some issues of the laser scan matching for global self-localization and map building. Different methods for the interpretation of sensor information have been investigated. Mobile robots have many applications in transportation, surveillance, health care and mining etc. For a successful navigation, the representation of the environment is crucial. The robot environment interaction is very complex in practice. Many factors contribute to this complexity, such as the electromechanical hardware structure and complex controlling and navigational programming modules. Above all however, it is the environment itself which is usually very complex. The perception model is the most important component of the navigation system of a mobile robot, at the core of which is the representation of the environment. Environment parameters are difficult to model and simplistic models are used in various position estimation techniques. However, for true autonomous navigation, the environment should be represented in a more dense fashion and the interpretation should be straightforward. The robot interacts with its environment using sensors. The sensory information provides clues about the location of the robot but the interpretion of this information is very challenging. Some type of model or a mathematical description of the environment is required for any meaningful interpretation and for making critical navigational decisions when a new observation arrives. The second key component of a navigation system is a motion model. Due to structural and software complexity the behaviour of a robot is rarely repeatable under the same motion commands. This can be attributed to many factors such as slippage, wear and tear of wheels at different rates, floor conditions or obstacle negotiation strategies. This means that motion commands have an associated uncertainty and need statistical treatment. Similarly the processing of raw laser data, although highly desirable, is computationally very expensive and therefore we usually need to make a trade off and extract some features from this data, despite losing some of the information. In this thesis we investigated three core issues of motion modelling, perception (or observation) modelling and scan correlation. Some auxiliary issues have also been addressed, such as the extraction of features from laser data and a broader classification of the environment suitable for certain situations. In regard to environment representation, we used the geometrical form of representation and tried to extract some statistical formulation. This method suggests to capture the environment model in a statistical form before the start of navigation when the map is known. The detailed parametric representation of the environment is obtained along with a proposal for a laser scan matching method based on geometrical line and corner features. The geometrical representation is based on some features extracted from raw laser data. This is considered a compact and easily implementable form, which was one of the objectives of our research, however utilisation of all the sensory information is still desirable and we have also investigated this issue. The models have been tested thoroughly on simulations and with real data in laboratory and office-like indoor environments. Laser scan matching is a technique of position estimation based on matching two laser scans taken at the initial and final positions of the robot. We also presented a method to find out the degree of match between two laser scans. At the end of the thesis, the scan correlation has been used to find the most reliable landmarks in the environment. This approach filters out the nuisance landmarks which increase the size of matrices in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms. An improved computational efficiency was of primary concern and a main focus of this research. All the methods proposed in this thesis, such as feature extraction, broader classification, parametric formulation, line segment based scan matching and the scan matching for measurement updates address the computational issues in a fundamental way by using an appropriate formulation of the problem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance and safety of centrifugal chillers using hydrocarbons.</field><field name="creator">Tadros, Amir, The University of New South Wales. School of Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The high ozone depletion and global warming potentials of fluorocarbon refrigerants have resulted in prohibitions and restrictions in many markets. Hydrocarbon refrigerants have low environmental impacts and are successfully used in domestic refrigerators and car air conditioners but replacing fluorocarbons in centrifugal chillers for air conditioning applications is unknown. Hydrocarbon replacements need a heat transfer correlation for refrigerant in flooded evaporators and predictions for operating conditions, capacity and performance. Safety precautions for large quantities of hydrocarbon refrigerants are needed and control of overpressure in plantrooms requires accurate prediction.  Reliable correlations exist for forced convection in a single phase flow, condensation outside tubes and evaporation off sprayed tubes. For flooded evaporators this thesis proposes a new correlation for forced convection boiling of any refrigerant. An enhancement factor is combined with a modified Chen coefficient using recent pool boiling and forced convection correlations outside tubes. This correlates within typically a factor of two to known boiling literature measurements for CFC-113, CFC-11, HCFC-123, HFC-134a and HC-601.  The operating conditions, capacity and performance of replacement hydrocarbons in centrifugal chillers were predicted using fluorocarbon performance as a model. With the new heat transfer correlation hydrocarbon predictions for flooded evaporators were made. For any fluorocarbon refrigerant there exists a replacement mixture of hydrocarbons which with a rotor speed increase about 40% gives the same cooling capacity in the same centrifugal chiller under the same operating conditions. For example replacing HCFC-123 in a flooded evaporator with HC-601/602 [90.4/9.6] and increasing the rotor speed by 43% will increase the coefficient of performance by 4.5% at the same cooling capacity.  The maximum plantroom overpressure considered was from leakage and ignition of a uniform air/refrigerant mixture with maximum laminar burning velocity. Flow was modelled using a turbulence viscosity due to Launder and Spalding and turbulent deflagration using a reaction progress variable after Zimont. These partial differential equations were solved approximately for two and three dimensional geometries using finite volume methods from the Fluent program suite. Simple overpressure predictions from maximum flame area approximations agreed with Fluent results within 13.7% promising safe plantroom design without months of computer calculation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">refrigeration</field><field name="subject">refrigerant replacements</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">centrifugal chiller</field><field name="subject">flooded evaporator</field><field name="subject">forced convection boiling</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="subject">overpressure in plantrooms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Firm Size Effect: An Application of Hierarchy Theories</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Hugh David, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis the positive relationship between firm size and wages is investigated through the application of hierarchy theories. Many different explanations have been proposed for this relationship, but have met only limited success at best. The strongest finding to date is that unobserved ability is a significant factor.  The question of interest here is ???why do wages increase as the size firm increases????  Hierarchy theories take a different approach towards the analysis of firms in comparison to the alternate theories which have dominated previous investigations. As a result of their focus on the organisational relationships within a firm???s internal structure, hierarchy theories offer certain insights to the size-wage relationship which to date have been unnoticed. An empirical investigation into the size-wage differential incorporating structural considerations into an augmented wage equation offers strong support for the propositions of hierarchy theories. I find that half of the firm size effect for workers can be explained by controlling for some aspects of management structure, and that span of control has a discontinuous effect on wages. These results are completely consistent with the existing findings on unobserved ability and have the added attraction of providing economic as well as statistical explanatory power.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Firm Size</field><field name="subject">Firm Size effect</field><field name="subject">Hierarchy Theory</field><field name="subject">Wages</field><field name="subject">Unobserved ability</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons</field><field name="creator">Fedorow, Heidi, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark polymer pigment present in specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. Interest in this pigment has rekindled in recent years because of a hypothesised link between NM and the especial vulnerability of NM-containing neurons to cell death in Parkinson???s disease (PD). Many aspects of the biology of NM are yet to be characterised. It is not known if NM like the similar melanin of the skin is synthesised via an enzymatic pathway or solely through autoxidation as has traditionally been thought. Examination of the ultrastructure of NM granules showed that in contrast to peripheral melanosomes, an electron-lucent lipid component was present that represented 30% of pigment volume. The identity of the lipid component of NM has remained unclear since it was first suggested that NM contained lipid in the 1960???s. NM lipid was biochemically isolated from the substantia nigra of 32 human brains. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry and 1H- and 13C NMR techniques, it was shown for the first time that the NM lipid is the polyisoprenoid dolichol. The age-related development and regulation of NM has not previously been described. Optical density and area measurements of unstained NM in ventral substantia nigra neurons spanning the ages of 24 weeks to 95 years old demonstrated three developmental phases. NM was not present at birth and initiation of pigmentation began at approximately 3 years of age, followed by a period of increasing pigment granule number and colouration until age 20. In PD brain, the ultrastructure of NM demonstrated that the amount of lipid did not change. However, filipin staining showed a reduction of cholesterol in PD NM containing neurons. In addition, immunogold staining of ??-synuclein demonstrated that this protein redistributed to the NM lipid in PD brain. The finding of phases in the development of NM, and the identification of lipid species in NM suggest that NM biology is regulated. This thesis has also demonstrated changes in the lipid and associated proteins in PD, suggesting NM???s chemical composition alters which may have functional consequences that contribute to PD.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Menschenleer.??? The Aesthetics of Humanity in the Novels of Christoph Ransmayr: Die Schrecken des Eises und der Finsternis, Die letzte Welt and Morbus Kitahara</field><field name="creator">Cook, Lynne Patricia, School of German &amp; Russian Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation is a comparative study which traces the development of a distinctive aesthetics in the late twentieth century novels of the Austrian writer, Christoph Ransmayr. The three novels, Die Schrecken des Eises und der Finsternis, Die letzte Welt and Morbus Kitahara, while quite different in terms of spatial and temporal orientation, share several key features which contribute to the operation of what I define and examine as the aesthetics of humility in the texts. These recurrent thematic, structural and symbolic elements in the three novels relate to the texts??? critique of scientific modernity, their privileging of myth (both thematically and stylistically), the representation of nature and the texts??? readings of apocalypse and transformation. The theory of myth developed by Hans Blumenberg in Arbeit am Mythos provides an interpretative framework to explain the re-emergence of myth as a contemporary response to the ???absolutism of reality??? which the systems and technologies of scientific modernity have produced in the twentieth century. The first part of this thesis examines the representation in individual novels of the collapse and breakdown of selected metanarratives of modernity. The second part consists of an examination of three core myths which function to restructure the narrative of human existence in each novel. This thesis determines that the development of the aesthetics of humility in Ransmayr???s novels is dependent on the reader???s recognition of the changed perspective and the changed perception which characters in each novel experience. To different extents the characters in each novel abandon a rational perception of reality. The aesthetics of reality acknowledges a textual consciousness and privileging of the projected Other of reason; nature, myth, fantasy, irrationality and barbarity. The human subject no longer occupies the privileged central position in humanist cosmology. Displaced from the centre to the periphery of civilization, the human subject is also represented as having lost control of its physical and psychical environment. Human pretensions to power and influence over itself and its environment are negated in the texts??? revelation of the transience of life. This loss of status and place is related on a seemingly moral level to the novels??? representation of the human potential for brutality and cruelty. The ultimate disappearance of the human subject in each novel is related to the subject???s gradual objectification in the text and the final dissolution of its identity.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ransmayr Christoph 1954</field><field name="subject">Schrecken des Eises und der Finsternis</field><field name="subject">Letzte Welt</field><field name="subject">Morbus Kitahara</field><field name="subject">Humility in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The single source chemical vapour deposition of alkaline earth metal oxide thin films</field><field name="creator">Hill, Matthew Roland, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Metal oxide thin films are dynamic materials that have revolutionised the nature of semiconductor and electronic thin film devices. Recently, progress has stagnated in some aspects due to the increasingly complex deposition apparatus required, and the dearth of suitable precursor complexes of certain ???difficult??? metals. This thesis seeks to address both of these issues. The application of a precursor complex, Mg6(O2CNEt2)12 to the SSCVD of MgO thin films delivered the highest quality films ever reported with this technique. The resultant films were found to be of purely (111) orientation. Due to the nature of the precursor, the chemical reactions occurring at the surface during SSCVD growth result in a high growth rate, low flux environment and films of (111) orientation have been achieved without the amorphous underlayer. This finding has important implications for buffer layers in perovskite thin film devices. The unprecedented precursor chemistry has been used as a basis for the extremely high quality material produced, along with the unusual, yet beneficial structural morphology it possesses. A new range of barium complexes with single encapsulating ligands have been prepared for use in chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of BaTiO3 thin films. A novel pathway to an unprecedented class of barium carbamates is reported, and also new dianionic bis ??-ketoesterates and their barium, strontium, and calcium analogues were synthesised. High resolution mass spectrometry showed the barium bis ??-ketoesterate derivatives to be monomeric, and preliminary testing indicated some volatility in these species. Insights were gained into the likely successful pathways to building a volatile heterobimetallic precursor complex containing an alkaline earth metal. The knowledge of intimate mixing in heterobimetallic precursor complexes was extended by some novel chemistry to develop the first mixed Zn/Mg carbamato cluster complexes. These complexes were found to be excellent SSCVD precursors for ZnxMg1-xO thin films. Thin films were deposited with these precursors and exhibited a single preferred orientation, with a constant amount of magnesium throughout the bulk of the films. Investigation of the light emission properties of the films revealed significant improvements in the structural order commensurate with the incorporation of magnesium, and the formation of the ZnxMg1-xO alloy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metal oxide semiconductors -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Chemical vapor deposition</field><field name="subject">Alkaline earth metals</field><field name="subject">Thin films -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of traditional versus group extension approaches on farmer behavioural change in an extensive grazing environment in the Bathurst District of New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Ajili, Abdulazim, School of Fibre Science &amp; Technology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study on different extension approaches was undertaken in the Bathurst area of New South Wales, Australia. One hundred farmers were surveyed in random pairs according to those who belong to the formal group, ???Landcare???, and those who did not. The survey included questions on personal, physical resources, ecological and economic factors, farm practices and management (including actual practice, use of extension methods and information sources) Focussing on behavioural change over time, attitudes, perceptions and intentions.  The impact of extension approach on different levels of innovation was considered: simple (e.g. tree planting), medium (e.g. pasture development) and complex (soil erosion control) on behavioural change. It was hypothesised that the ???group??? extension approach should be more effective with complex innovations, but the main significant differences found were in level of tree planting (higher in government funded Landcare), money spent on erosion control (including tree planting) and attitudes to the severity of local erosion (all higher in Landcare members). There were no other differences in attitudes, intentions or change in farming practice except that non-Landcare farmers planted more pasture and applied more lime. The outcomes did not support the hypothesis, and it was not possible to distinguish the differences that did occur in performance from extension approach versus access to funds.  Field days are an important extension method for the adoption of cropping by landholders. Among the different extension methods, those who conducted erosion control through pastures, preferred government officers and meetings. Those who adopted tree planting and were in Landcare preferred magazines as the extension method. This added further weight to the argument that the formal group extension approach may not be perceived by its members to have any influence on adoption at this level.  Generally, mass media was more important in the early stages of adoption and personal influence more important in the evaluation stage. This also applied to simple versus complex innovations. Surprisingly all farmers placed a very high reliance on government officers for information and decision-making, particularly those in Landcare, compared to neighbours or family.  Formal group extension still needs assessing but using models other than Landcare.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural extension work</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Bathurst</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of surface science to sulfide mineral processing</field><field name="creator">Goh, Siew Wei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surface spectroscopic techniques have been applied to facets of the flotation beneficiation and hydrometallurgical extraction of sulfide minerals to enhance the fundamental understanding of these industrially important processes. As a precursor to the determination of surface chemical composition, the sub-surface properties of some sulfide minerals that have not previously been fully characterised were also investigated. The electronic properties of ??-NiS and ??-NiS (millerite), Ni3S2 (heazlewoodite), (Ni,Fe)9S8 (pentlandite), CuFe2S3 (cubanite), CuFeS2 (chalcopyrite), Cu5FeS4 (bornite) and CuS (covellite) were investigated by conventional and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy augmented by ab initio density of state calculations and NEXAFS spectral simulations. Particular aspects studied included the relationship between sulfur coordination number and core electron binding energies, the higher than expected core electron binding energies for the sulfur in the metal-excess nickel sulfides, and the formal oxidation states of the Cu and Fe in Cu-Fe sulfides. It was concluded that the binding energy dependence on coordination number was less than previously believed, that Ni-Ni bonding was the most likely explanation for the unusual properties of the Ni sulfides, and that there was no convincing evidence for Cu(II) in sulfides as had been claimed. Most of the NEXAFS spectra simulated by the FEFF8 and WIEN2k ab initio codes agreed well with experimental spectra, and the calculated densities of states were useful in rationalising the observed properties. XPS, static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and NEXAFS spectroscopy were used to investigate thiol flotation collector adsorption on several sulfides in order to determine the way in which the collector chemisorbs to the mineral surface, to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and to characterise the multilayer species. It was found that static SIMS alone was able to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and together with angle-resolved NEXAFS spectroscopy, was also able to confirm that 2-mercaptobenzothiazole interacted through both its N and exocyclic S atoms. The altered layers formed on chalcopyrite and heazlewoodite during acid leaching were examined primarily by means of threshold S KLL Auger electron spectroscopy, but no evidence for buried interfacial species was obtained.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Sulphide minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrogeology, hydrochemistry and isotope hydrology of Palm Valley, Central Australia</field><field name="creator">Wischusen, John David Henry, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Palm Valley oasis in arid central Australia is characterised by stands of palm trees (Livistona mariae). How these unique plants, separated by nearly a 1000 kilometres of arid country from their nearest relatives persist, has long fascinated visitors. Defining the hydrogeology of the Hermannsburg Sandstone, a regionally extensive and thick Devonian sequence of the Amadeus Basin that underlies Palm Valley, is the major thrust of investigation. Appraisal of drilling data shows this aquifer to be a dual porosity fractured rock aquifer which, on a regional scale, behaves as a low permeability, hydraulically continuous resource. Groundwater is low salinity (TDS &amp;lt1000 mg/L) and bicarbonate rich. Slight variations in cation chemistry indicate different flow paths with separate geochemical histories have been sampled. Stable isotope (????H, ???????O) results from Palm Valley show groundwater to have a uniform composition that plots on or near a local meteoric water line. Radiocarbon results are observed to vary from effectively dead (&amp;lt 4%) to 87 % modern carbon. To resolve groundwater age beyond the radiocarbon window the long lived radioisotope 36Cl was also used. Ratios of 36Cl/Cl range from 130 to 290 x 10-15. In this region atmospheric 36Cl/Cl ratio is around 300 x 10-15. Thus an age range of around 300 ka is indicated if, as is apparent, radioactive decay is the only significant cause of 36Cl/Cl variation within the aquifer. A review of previous, often controversial, 36Cl decay studies shows results are usually ambiguous due to lack of certainty when factoring subsurface Cl- addition into decay calculations. Apparently, due to the thickness of the Hermannsburg Sandstone, no subsurface sources of Cl- such as aquitards or halites, are encountered along groundwater flow paths, hence the clear 36Cl decay trend seen. The classic homogenous aquifer with varying surface topography, the &amp;quotToth&amp;quot flow model, is the simplest conceptual model that need be invoked to explain these isotope data.

Optimum conditions for the extraction of lentil flours which passed through a 0.79 mm screen were pH 9.0 at 30??C for Matilda and pH 8.5 at 35??C for both Digger and Cobber. These conditions enable a high yield of lentil starches and proteins, with minimal changes or damage to their quality. Matilda offered advantages for processors over the other varieties: it had higher protein and fibre; lower lipid; and greater foam-forming capacity and foam stability. Its starch had higher Tg, lower Tm and better expansion behaviour.  All lentil starches were shear-thinning. The flow of the molten lentil starches under limited moisture content differed from starches sheared in excess moisture condition. When extruded, lentil starches offered good expansion and had higher Tg than did cereal starches in extruded products. The overall rheological behaviour of lentil flours differed from that of their corresponding starches. The lentil flours had poorer pasting quality and expansion possibly because of interference by their lipid and protein components. Starch rheological behaviour was greatly affected by the amylose/amylopectin ratio and the molecular weight of starches, while flour behaviour was more influenced by the interfering components.  The ?? value obtained from capillary rheometry (CR) could be used for the screening of materials for their expansion behaviour. The CR data gave excellent agreement to the results achieved from the extruder and in predicting the expansion indices and calculated viscosity of six flour blends. In all, the quantitative and qualitative knowledge on the physico-chemistry and rheology of lentils give a better understanding of the behaviour of lentil flours and starches in the expansion of extruded products, producing suitable end products with acceptable quality and storage stability. This project highlights the lentil flour and starch rheology characteristics in view of possible application in extruded products.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lentils -- Processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc and nickel disrupt tubular vacuole and mitochondrial networks, but only nickel disrupts microtubules in hyphal tip cells of two Paxillus involutus strains</field><field name="creator">Tuszynska, Sandra, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ectomycorrhizal fungi are able to ameliorate heavy metal stress to host trees in polluted soils. Their sensitivity or tolerance to heavy metals is usually examined based on growth and proliferation on heavy metal amended media. However, there are no data on cellular effects of heavy metals and detoxification in live cells of these fungi. Organelle morphology has recently been recognized as an indication of cellular health and its changes can be used to assess cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate short term effects of common heavy metal pollutants, Zn2+ and Ni2+ on the morphology of vacuoles, mitochondria and microtubules in hyphal tip cells of two Paxillus involutus strains. Vacuoles, mitochondria and microtubules were labeled with Oregon Green?? 488 carboxylic acid diacetate, 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide ((DiOC6(3)) and anti-??- tubulin antibodies, respectively. They were treated with 0-1 mmol L-1 NiSO4 or 0-100 mmol L-1 ZnSO4 or K2SO4 (SO4 2- control) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Vacuoles and mitochondria in untreated hyphal tip cells of strain P2 which originated from a heavy metal-rich soil were motile and tubular forming networks. Exposure to the metals caused tubular vacuole thickening and vesiculation as well as fragmentation of tubular mitochondria in living hyphal tip cells. The highest K2SO4 concentration also had severe effects on mitochondria. These effects were metal, concentration and exposure time dependent. NiSO4 caused these effects at a hundred fold lower concentration than ZnSO4 and induced severe microtubule disruption. Vacuole tubularity recovered after removal of the metal solutions depending on the metal, concentration and exposure time. Mitochondrial tubularity recovered to pretreatment morphology in a shorter time and even during exposure to the highest metal concentration. Vacuoles of strain P46 which originated from a non-polluted soil were pleomorphic, but mainly spherical with occasional tubular interconnections. The vacuoles were too sensitive to UV light exposure required for fluorescence microscopy to investigate their response to heavy metals. The mitochondrial network and microtubules resembled those of strain P2. The highest ZnSO4 and NiSO4 concentrations caused similar trends in response of mitochondria and microtubules of the two strains. However, mitochondria of strain P46 were less sensitive at lower metal concentrations. The highest K2SO4 concentration had more severe effects on mitochondria of strain P46 than in strain P2 from which tubularity was not recovered. This investigation is the first to reveal that heavy metals affect organelle morphology in two strains of an ectomycorrhizal fungus. Nickel effects on the organelles are likely to result from microtubule disruption. Metal induced mitochondrial fragmentation is possibly an apoptotic response and the recovery of tubular organelle networks suggests cellular detoxification.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional repression mechanisms of sporulation-specific genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="creator">Reodica, Mayfebelle, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">For organisms undergoing a developmental process it is ideal that specific genes are induced and repressed at the correct time and to the correct level in a coordinated manner. The process of meiosis and spore formation (collectively known as sporulation) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a convenient system to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms of gene repression and the contribution such repression mechanisms offer to cells capable of undergoing a developmental process. This thesis focuses on transcriptional repression of sporulation-specific genes during both vegetative/mitotic conditions and sporulation. The fitness contribution of transcriptional repressors that regulate sporulationspecific genes during vegetative growth were investigated considering the similarities between meiosis and mitosis such as DNA replication, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Well-characterised sporulation genes of different functions were expressed in vegetative cells and ectopic expression of these genes was found not to be lethal. It was ascertained through strain competition studies that ectopic expression of the genes IME1, SMK1, SPR3 and DIT1 during mitotic growth did not affect cellular fitness. The expression of NDT80 in vegetative cells, however, caused a marked reduction in fitness and cells were also further compromised in the absence of the Sum1p repressor that regulates NDT80 transcription. The role of NDT80 as a transcriptional activator of middle sporulation genes, rather than the over-expression of NDT80 as a protein, caused the reduction of cell viability. Transcriptional regulation of the middle sporulation-specific gene SPR3 by the meiosis-specific Set3p repressor complex was investigated using synchronous sporulation cultures of the W303a/?? strain commonly used for sporulation studies. In a mutant W303a/?? ??set3/??set3 strain, lacking a key component of the Set3p repression complex, the transcription of SPR3 was uncharacteristically expressed at higher levels and derepressed during late sporulation. This SPR3 expression was consistent for both SPR3 transcript and SPR3::lacZ reporter protein studies. This preliminary work will enable future studies, using SPR3 promoter deletions fused to a lacZ reporter, aimed at determining the region of the SPR3 promoter that the Set3p complex may interact with to transcriptionally repress the gene during sporulation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Molecular genetics -- Technique</field><field name="subject">Genetics, Experimental</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aptamers to the hepatitis C virus polymerase</field><field name="creator">Jones, Louisa Alice School of Biotechnology And Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Treatments for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are currently only partially effective. Research into antivirals directed at HCV viral proteins are commonly based and tested on a single genotype, namely genotype 1. This is despite the high level of variability of the RNA virus and the frequency of infection with genotypes other than 1. The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a novel in vitro approach for the isolation of antiviral agents. SELEX allows rapid screening of vast nucleic acid libraries to isolate sequences (termed aptamers) that bind to target proteins with high affinity. The SELEX approach was used in the present study to isolate DNA aptamers to the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [non-structural protein B (NS5B)] protein of HCV subtype 3a, with the aim of inhibiting polymerase activity. Ten rounds of selection were performed using a Biacore 2000 and resultant aptamers cloned from rounds 2, 4, 8 and 10. Sequences of aptamers were aligned to elucidate common motifs and a proportion of the aptamers from rounds 8 and 10 (29/48) were screened for binding ability using the Biacore. The five ???best binding??? aptamers were investigated for inhibition of 3a polymerase activity in an in vitro polymerase assay. Two aptamers, r10/43 and r10/47, were chosen for further studies based on their ability to inhibit polymerase activity. The inhibition constants (Ki) of r10/43 and r10/47 were estimated to be 1.4 + 2.4 nM and 6.0 + 2.3 nM respectively. The affinity (Kd) of these aptamers for the 3a polymerase was estimated to be 1.3 + 0.3 nM (r10/43) and 23.5 + 6.7 nM (r10/47). The estimated inhibition and dissociation constants of these two aptamers are among the best for inhibitory aptamers of the HCV enzymes (polymerase and protease). Inhibition of HCV 3a polymerase appeared to be specific for r10/47, whilst r10/43 also had some inhibitory effect on norovirus and ??6 polymerase activity. This study is the first description of an inhibitor to the HCV subtype 3a polymerase that investigates genotypic specificity of targeted antivirals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular biology</field><field name="subject">RNA polymerases</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalytic fixed bed membrane reactor operation for hydrocarbon conversion processes</field><field name="creator">Althenayan, Faisal M., School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dry/CO2 reforming is one the hydrocarbon processes that recently has been interesting due to it is ability of producing a lower synthesis gas ratio (H2/CO). This synthesis gas is a highly significant product since it costs more than 50% of the total capital cost of gas to liquid (GTL) process. However, since this reaction is thermodynamically limited, higher temperature or lower pressure is required to achieve higher conversion. Typically, reaction temperatures between 1073 and 1173 K are used for catalytic dry reforming reactions. Consequently, these extreme temperatures lead to a severe carbon deposition causing a catalyst deactivation which is the major difficulty related to CO2 reforming reaction. This has pushed the efforts to be focused mainly on the development of new catalysts. In fact, dry reforming of propane is an equilibrium-limited reaction which can be shifted to the product side by removing one of the products out of the system which can be achieved using a selective membrane reactor. This research is dedicated to investigate and study the catalytic performance of dry reforming of propane over cobalt-nickel catalyst under the temperature range of 773-973 K. This bimetallic catalyst supported on ??-Al2O3 has been utilized in this research since it exhibits better activity, selectivity, and deactivation resistance than monometallic catalysts. Based on this, the primary aims of this thesis are to examine this catalyst and to study the impact of using membrane reactor. In addition, the reaction mechanism and kinetic are investigated using a fixed-bed reactor. Experimental observations have exposed that the catalyst is offering good results under this reaction. The catalysts analysis has confirmed the presence of metal oxides in the catalyst. However, only at a lower carbon dioxide to propane ratio, i.e. lower than 3.5, a carbon signal has been reported. The activation energy study indicates that the process is unlimited by diffusion. The reaction order for propane and carbon dioxide has been found to be zero and 1.17 respectively. This in turn has indicated that C3H8 activation reaction  is taking place rapidly and carbon dioxide is suggested to be involved in the rate determining step. In membrane reactor operation, the production rates for H2 and CO have been reported to increase as the sweep gas flow rate increases. The co-current mode offers higher production rate and more stability than counter-current mode over the range of feed ratio. On the other hand, fixed bed reactor shows stable performance and produces more CO and H2 for both modes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Membrane reactors</field><field name="subject">Catalysts</field><field name="subject">Hydrocarbons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology, geochemistry and evolution of the Esfordi Phosphate - Iron Deposit, Bafq Area, Central Iran</field><field name="creator">Jami, Morteza, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Esfordi is a Kiruna-type Fe???P oxide deposit in the Bafq district of Iran. It formed within a predominantly rhyolitic volcanic sequence that formed in a continental margin tectonic regime and is of Cambrian age. The gently dipping, stratabound ore body is lenticular and displays a well-developed mineralogical zonal pattern. The Fe-oxide rich core contains a central zone of massive magnetite and a more hematitic brecciated rim. The overlying P-rich ore body contains massive and brecciated, apatite-rich variants with accessory hematite and actinolite. A zone of apatite-bearing veins and disseminations envelopes the Fe-oxide and P-rich zones and extends into overlying volcaniclastics that contain detrital magnetite ?? apatite clasts. The main ore zones are surrounded by Ca-rich alteration, dominated by actinolite, extending ~100 m into the more permeable overlying volcaniclastics. Beyond this envelope is widespread development of secondary K-feldspar. Mesoscopic and microscopic observations reveal a paragenetic sequence containing four generations of apatite. The early stage is a LREE-rich apatite 1 that occurs within the massive and brecciated magnetite core. The second generation is large and brecciated apatite 2, associated with hematite and actinolite. Both apatite 1 and 2 exhibit widespread dissolution and reprecipitation to form a LREE-poor granular apatite that is generally associated with quartz-carbonate??REE minerals. The final stage involved an overprint of LREE-poor apatite 3-carbonate-quartz-actinolite-chlorite-epidote??bastnaesite??synchesite extending into the host rocks. Fluid inclusions in apatite 1 have homogenisation temperatures of 375-425oC and indicate salinities of 14???18 wt. % NaCl. The magnetite displays low ???????O of -0.1???1.7 ???, suggesting precipitation from fluids with ???????O of 7.8???9.6 ??? at ~400oC, consistent with a magmatic source. Fluid inclusions in apatite 2 homogenise between 195???295oC with indicated salinities of 13???19 wt. % NaCl. The associated hematite displays ???????O of -0.2???2.3 ??? which would be in equilibrium with fluids having a ???????O of 10.7???13.0 ??? at ~250oC. Such enriched isotopic fluids suggest interaction of magmatic fluids with cooler saline fluids that were probably derived from the underlying carbonate-rich sequences. Fluid inclusions in apatite 3 and quartz homogenise at 145???155oC and, together with a quartz ???????O of 16.0???17.1 ???, suggests precipitation from a fluid with ???????O of -0.7???2.1 ??? that is likely to have resulted from the introduction of a cooler, less saline and isotopically depleted fluid (such as sea water). The results of this study clearly indicate a significant role for fluids in the evolution of the Esfordi deposit but do not preclude a role for immiscible Fe-oxide???P-rich melts in the initial stages of the mineralising process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology - Iran</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry - Iran</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investigation of novel polymer-photochromic conjugates</field><field name="creator">Such, Georgina, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">My research has focussed on the development of a technique to tailor photochromic switching rates by creating a customised local environment for the dye within an otherwise rigid host matrix. Living radical polymerisation offers the potential to design such a system. A living radical initiator based on a spirooxazine compound was used to polymerise a polymer chain of well controlled molecular weight and polydispersity. This technique facilitated the construction of a conjugate with every photochromic moiety convalently attached to a polymer chain with uniform characteristics. The photochromic behaviour of these new polymer-spirooxazine conjugates were investigated in a cross-linked polymer matrix with a Tg of approximately 120??C. It is well known that photochromic switching is susceptible to local environment effects such as rigidity, free volume and polarity.1, 2 The goal of these systems was to create a uniform local environment which would facilitate controlled changes in the photochromic switching rates. The photophysical investigation of these systems demonstrated the success of this technique. The photochromic rates were directly related to the characteristics of the polymer conjugate. It was postulated the conjugates acted as a customised local environment for the photochromic moiety, encapsulating it from the host matrix. Consequently systematic tailoring of the photochromic switching rates was achieved by changes in the characteristics of the attached polymer. To our knowledge this is the first technique to control local environment of a photochromic compound and thus the first example of systematic tuning of photochromic switching rates. Throughout this research, several characteristics of the attached polymer were modified to give a series of rules for the tuning of photochromic switching rates using this technique.  The largest variation in switching speed is achieved through variation of Tg. A range of photochromic rates from extremely slow to near solution-like can be easily achieved. The necessary variations in Tg can be achieved easily using living radical polymerisation techniques. The use of different homopolymers, block and random copolymers were all demonstrated successfully in this work. For finer tuning of the photochromic rates, changes in chain length can be used. It was also found the best living radical polymerisation method for this work was ATRP due to the bulky or incompatible halogen which contributed to efficient encapsulation. However this endgroup effect is only important in systems which do not have a low Tg component. The incorporation of such a component overrides all other contributions to the overall behaviour.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymeric composites</field><field name="subject">Photochromic polymers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to the synthesis of block and graft copolymers with well defined segment lengths</field><field name="creator">Postma, Almar, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The synthesis of amine end-functionalised polymers by controlled free radical techniques has been investigated with a focus on methods that provide primary amino end-functionalised polystyrene. The aim of these investigations was to provide precursors to block and graft polyolefins and polyesters by interchain coupling reactions. The approaches investigated involved developing strategies for the synthesis of phthalimido-functional polymers which can be quantitatively deprotected to yield the desired amino-functional polymers. Initially synthesis by atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) was explored. A number of approaches based on ??-functionalisation (end-group substitution) and ??-functionalisation (functional initiator) were examined. A novel ATRP initiator, N-bromomethylphthalimide, provided the most promising results but still had limited applicability because of its low solubility in polymerisation media. The problems encountered with the ATRP approaches prompted an exploration of techniques based on reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) approach. Novel phthalimidomethyl RAFT agents (trithiocabonates, xanthates) were synthesized. The activity and scope of the new RAFT agents was investigated in polymerisations of styrene, n-butyl acrylate, Nisopropylacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone (trithiocarbonate) and vinyl acetate (xanthate). The syntheses of ??-phthalimidomethylpolystyrene were successfully scaled up and hydrazinolysis afforded a range of ??- aminomethylpolystyrenes of low polydispersity and controlled molecular weight. The syntheses of primary amino-functional polymers using the pthalimidofunctional RAFT agents necessitated the development of a convenient method for conversion of trithiocarbonate groups to inert chain ends. Thermolysis proved a most simple and efficient method of achieving this for both polystyrene and poly(n-butyl acrylate). Thermolysis also provided a means of further characterising the mechanism of the RAFT process.  A simple and efficient method for amino end-group analysis was developed that involved in-situ derivatisation with trichloroacetyl isocyanate followed by 1H NMR analysis. The method was shown to be a suitable method for determining a wide range protic end-groups (NH2, OH, COOH) in synthetic polymers. Finally, metallocene polyolefin based coupling trials largely with controlled amino-functional polystyrene were conducted as an initial investigation into the production of high value added grafted polyolefins (and polyester).

Microbial pyruvate produced by a vitamin auxotrophic strain of Candida glabrata was selected as a potential substrate for biotransformation. With an optimal thiamine concentration of 60 ??g/l, a pyruvic acid concentration of 43 g/l and yield of 0.42 g/g glucose consumed were obtained. Using microbially-produced unpurified pyruvate resulted in similar PAC concentrations to those with commercial pure substrate confirming its potential for enzymatic PAC production. To obtain high activity yeast PDC, Candida utilis was cultivated in a controlled bioreactor. Optimal conditions for PDC production were identified as: fermentative cell growth at initial pH at 6.0 followed by pH downshift to 3.0. Average specific PDC carboligase activity of 392 ?? 20 U/g DCW was achieved representing a 2.7-fold increase when compared to a constant pH process. A mechanism was proposed in which the cells adapted to the pH decrease by increasing PDC activity to convert the accumulated internal pyruvic acid via acetaldehyde to ethanol thereby reducing intracellular acidification. The effect of pH shift on specific PDC activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae achieved a comparable increase of specific PDC carboligase activity to 335 U/g DCW. The effect of pyruvic acid at pH 3.0 on induction of PDC activity was confirmed by cultivation at pH 3 with added pyruvic acid. Using microarray techniques, genome-wide transcriptional analyses of the effect of pH shift on S. cerevisiae revealed a transient increased expression of PDC1 after pH shift, which corresponded to the increase in specific PDC activity (although the latter was sustained for a longer period). The results showed significant gene responses to the pH shift with approximately 39 % of the yeast genome involved. The induced transcriptional responses to the pH shift were distinctive and showed only limited resemblance to gene responses reported for other environmental stress conditions, namely increased temperature, oxidative conditions, reduced pH (succinic acid), alkaline pH and increased osmolarity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enzymes -- Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Ephadrine</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological studies of sbs based interpenetrating polymer networks</field><field name="creator">Markotsis, Martin G., School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of polystyrene-polybutadiene-polystyrene (SBS) block copolymers and polystyrene (PS) were prepared using sequential network formation with the polybutadiene (PB) of the SBS crosslinked thermally and the styrene network formed thermally or by ??-radiation. The use of ??-radiation to cure the added PS network at room temperature successfully avoided thermal degradation of the butadiene segments within the SBS which had been observed in earlier studies. Both linear SBS and radial SB4 IPNs were studied to compare the influence of linear or branched block copolymers on the IPN morphology. The molecular morphology was examined using a suite of techniques including thermal analysis (DSC and DMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and smallangle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS). The primary SBS/SB4 network morphology was found to dominate the IPN morphology with the secondary styrene network limited to selectively swelling the PS domains. The linear SBS IPNs displayed a more ordered morphology than the radial SB4 IPNs, and this morphology was investigated in pseudo three-dimensions by sectioning samples in two perpendicular directions. The morphology was found to be consistent with thermally formed systems prepared in previous studies, and contained styrenic domains of 20-50 nm within a continuous butadiene matrix. The weight of evidence suggested that the lamella structure dominated the linear SBS IPNs and a cylindrical structure for the radial SB4 IPNs. Maximum values of tensile strength and elongation at break (20 MPa and 140% respectively) were observed in samples with a styrene cure ??-radiation dose of 200 kGy. The SANS analysis of these polymer systems was expanded to investigate the thermal formation of the added PS network in real time. Time-resolved SANS allowed the development of nanostructures in the bulk samples to be measured, and compared to previous time-independent TEM studies on thin sections. The formation of the styrene network was most noticeably observed in a linear SBS IPN system, in which an increase in long-range order was observed and attributed to movement of styrene monomer into the styrenic domains and sharpening of the phase boundaries between the PS and the PB regions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="subject">Polymer networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and molecular aspects of HIV-associated lipodystrophy</field><field name="creator">Mallon, Patrick William Gerard, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">HIV-associated lipodystrophy (HIVLD) syndrome is a condition comprising abnormalities in distribution of body fat and metabolism of lipids and glucose that arises in HIV-infected patients on long-term antiretroviral therapy. This thesis describes clinical research into aspects of the natural history and treatment of HIVLD, as well as molecular research into its pathogenesis centred on subcutaneous adipose tissue. Results demonstrate HIVLD to be a treatment-induced syndrome characterised by initial gains in body fat followed by selective, progressive loss of limb fat. Exposure to thymidineanalogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tNRTI) induces lipoatrophy through mitochondrial dysfunction of which inhibition of mitochondrial RNA expression, rather than mitochondrial DNA depletion, is an early feature. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with decreases in expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR??), an adipocyte transcription factor, which helps explain how tNRTI exposure leads to the loss of adipocyte function. Once established, lipoatrophy is characterised by mitochondrial DNA depletion, although this depletion occurs throughout the mitochondrial genome, suggesting an underlying cause other than inhibition of DNA polymerase gamma. HIVLD is a difficult syndrome to treat. Lipoatrophy is resistant to treatment with rosiglitazone, an agonist of PPAR??, which is ineffective in the setting of ongoing tNRTI therapy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Dyslipidaemia is also difficult to treat as use of pravastatin in the setting of ongoing exposure to protease inhibitors results in only modest declines in fasting cholesterol concentrations. Gains in central fat, such as that seen in patients with buffalo hump, are associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, but only occur in a relatively small percentage of treated patients, suggesting a role for  genetic factors in its development. Use of strategies such as avoidance of tNRTI in firstline ART, genetic screening to identify those at risk of toxicities and targeted selection of interventions in subgroups of affected patients, may help prevent this syndrome occurring and better treat those patients in which it has already occurred.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antiretroviral agents.</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Toxicology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating factors that influence carbon dissolution from Coke into Molten iron.</field><field name="creator">Cham, S. Tsuey, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The need for more efficient blast furnaces is even greater now that there are stricter environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Coke within the blast furnace not only supports the furnace bed and allows gas flow, it also carburises liquid iron. The carburisation of iron is one of the most important reactions and must be better understood if the ironmaking process in the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. By understanding what coke properties influence the rate at which coke dissolves in iron we can predict a coke?s performance and use it to determine its quality.  As carbon dissolution rates have only been determined for a few cokes, a systematic and comprehensive study was conducted on the dissolution of carbon from nine Australian cokes into liquid iron. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from Cokes A to I was measured and a range of experimental techniques were used to elucidate the dominant rate influencing factors. The role of coke structure, coke inorganic matter composition and yield and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of interfacial products and dynamic wettability studies were also conducted.  The carburiser cover method was used to measure carbon pick-up as a function of time over the temperature range of 1450-1550 ??C. Fundamental data on the apparent carbon dissolution rate constant (K) in molten iron at 1550 ??C for Cokes A to I were obtained and ranged from K (x 103 s-1) = 0.47 to K (x 103 s-1) = 14.7. The wide variation in K showed that not all cokes dissolve at similar rates. In fact one of the nine cokes in this investigation dissolved at a rate comparable to graphite dissolution rates.  The apparent carbon dissolution activation energy, Ea, for two of the nine cokes plus synthetic graphite (SG) was also determined. The Ea obtained for SG (Ea = 54 kJ / mol) was in agreement with literature values and was consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism. The observed Ea values for Cokes D and F (313 kJ / mol and 479 kJ / mol respectively) are an order of magnitude larger than the Ea obtained for SG. The difference in Ea between cokes and SG does not appear to be solely due to differences in the structure of the carbon source. The difference in Ea between the cokes was attributed to differences in their inorganic matter composition. The interfacial contact area is a function of inorganic matter yield and composition, which in turn is a function of temperature. Therefore, as temperature decreases the slag / ash layer produced at the carbon / iron interface can increase in area and viscosity and thus hinder carbon dissolution and transfer, and increasing the apparent activation energy for carbon dissolution. Thus, the differences in viscosity and melting temperature of the interfacial product play a key role.  Wettability experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique. The wettability of Cokes D, F and G with liquid iron at 1550 ??C was measured as a function of time. All three coke samples showed non-wetting behaviour with contact angles ranging between 123-129?? in the initial stages and between 109-114?? after two hours of contact. The differences in the wettability of the three coke samples could not explain the large differences in dissolution rates observed between these cokes. Thus, the wettability of these coke samples was not considered a dominant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution.  The sessile drop technique was also used to study the interfacial products formed at the coke / iron interface. The interfacial products formed on the underside of the iron droplet after contact with Cokes F and G were initially different in regards to the morphology and chemical composition. The interfacial product formed with Coke G had a network or mesh like structure that seemed to wet the iron droplet much better than the interfacial product formed with Coke F. In contrast, Fe globules and discrete interfacial products were observed in Coke F. It was suggested that this was due to differences in inorganic matter content, especially in calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) content in the coke.  Formation of interfacial products containing sulfides, such as calcium sulfide (CaS) and manganese sulfide (MnS), were observed on the iron side of the interface of both Cokes F and G. As a result, the interfacial products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution and decreasing the rate of carbon dissolution. The presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product, which in turn can affect the overall viscosity of the interfacial layer. Thus, the deposition of reaction products at the interfacial region can have a significant effect on carbon dissolution rates.  The mineral pyrrhotite was also identified as a significant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. Electron dispersive X-ray analyses of Coke F identified iron to be in close association with sulfur. These Fe / S species have atomic ratio similar to pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS) or troilite (FeS). Pyrrhotite in coke can decompose to release gaseous sulfur and metallic iron, which can be carburised by carbon in the surrounding area to form Fe-C particles. Thus, carburisation of liquid iron can occur via Fe-C particles.  There was little difference in structure between the nine coke samples and therefore the high dissolution rates of Coke F, cannot be explained on the basis of crystallite size or anisotropic carbon content. Inorganic matter yield and composition were identified as the dominant rate influencing factors on carbon dissolution. More specifically: - High content of iron phases, such as iron oxides and pyrrhotite, can lead to an increase in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to increased amounts of Fe-C particles that are formed upon the reduction of magnetite and decomposition of pyrrhotite, and carried through the slag layer to carburise the bulk liquid iron. - High aluminium oxide content can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to higher ash fusion / melting temperature or decrease in wettability, both of which lead to a decrease in carbon / iron contact area. - Formation of interfacial products, such as CaS and MnS, can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. Such products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution. However, the presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product. - An increase in temperature increases the rate of carbon dissolution. This dependence is predominantly due to the composition of the inorganic matter present in cokes, which influences the viscosity and melting point of the interfacial product formed and hence contact area between coke and iron.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liquid iron.</field><field name="subject">Coke -- Carbonization.</field><field name="subject">Carbon.</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution and phenotypic diversification in serratia marcescens biofilms.</field><field name="creator">Koh, Kai-Shyang, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The release of cells from a biofilm to the surrounding environment is poorly understood and the importance of this stage of biofilm development has only recently been realized. A key part of this process is the generation of phenotypic variants in the biofilm dispersal population. This thesis reports on the characterization of biofilm development of Serratia marcescens MG1, the analysis of the biofilm dispersal population, and the identification of the conditions that trigger phenotypic diversification. Furthermore, it provides an insight into the molecular understanding of how phenotypic variation is being generated, and demonstrates the clinical and environmental implications of phenotypic diversification during bacterial pathogenesis and bacterial persistence. Characterization of the microcolony biofilm development of S. marcescens revealed that the S. marcescens biofilm develops through a process involving microcolony formation, hollowing of mature microcolonies, and a sudden biofilm expansion within a very short period (&amp;lt 24h) resulting in an increase in biofilm biomass with a radiation of biofilm structures at days 3 to 4. The biofilm expansion phase consistently correlated to an increase in the number of dispersal variant morphotypes. Studies of variant induction in planktonic cultures and biofilm flow cells demonstrated that phenotypic diversification in S. marcescens is not only a biofilm-specific phenomenon, but also involves biofilm-specific morphotypes. These morphological variants can only be isolated from the microcolony biofilm morphotype and not from the filamentous biofilms, leading to the hypothesis that there is a strong diversifying selection that is specific to the microcolony biofilms. To further explore how these variants were generated, molecular analyses revealed that  exopolysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides are important moieties that are involved in phenotypic variation in S. marcescens biofilms. The etk gene, encoding a tyrosine protein kinase within the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis operon, was found to contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were present in the 'sticky' variants but not in the 'non-sticky' wild-type or the 'non sticky' small colony variants. Furthermore, infrequent-restriction-site PCR (IRS-PCR), BIOLOG metabolic profiling, and gene sequence analyses, suggest that phenotypic diversification in S. marcescens is likely to involve mutational hotspots in specific genes.  The biofilm-derived morphotypic variants differed extensively in cell ultrastructure properties, and exhibited specialized colonization and virulence traits, such as attachment, biofilm formation, swimming and swarming motilities, protease production, and hemolysin production. It was also demonstrated that phenotypic diversification contributed to a varying degree of resistance to protozoan predation, and bacterial pathogenecity in Caenorhabditis elegans, highlighting the complexity of the dispersal populations from S. marcescens biofilms. Furthermore, mixed-culture experiments involving multiple variant isolates (with or without the parental wild-type) showed that the persistence and virulence potential of S. marcescens can be synergistically enhanced in the Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing model and in the C. elegans infection model, respectively. This indicates that the different bacterial morphotypes work in concert to provide S. marcescens with enhanced protection against environmental perturbations and a competitive edge during the infection process. It was proposed that phenotypic diversification is not only an integral part of S. marcescens biofilm life-cycle, but also represents an important strategy for bacteria to greatly enhance its survival and persistence in different environments, ranging from aquatic and soil ecosystems, to those of the infected hosts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenotype.</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Serratia marcescens.</field><field name="subject">Biofilms.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidative stress responses and sumoylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Chong-Han, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with cellular responses to stress including the adaptive response to H2O2, and the cellular roles of sumoylation in stress responses. 286 H2O2-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutants were screened and YAP1, SKN7, GAL11, RPE1, TKL1, IDP1 were identified to be important for adaptation to H2O2. The mutants fell into two groups based on their responses to acute and chronic doses of H2O2. Transcription factors Yap1p, Skn7p and Gal11p were important for both acute and chronic responses to H2O2. Yap1p and Skn7p were needed for up-regulation of anti-oxidant functions rather than generation of NADPH or glutathione. Adaptation was reduced in strains deleted for GPX3 and YBP1, which are involved in sensing H2O2 and activating Yap1p, but to a lesser extent than YAP1 deletion. RPE1, TKL1 and IDP1 deletants affected in NADPH production were chronically sensitive to H2O2, but resistant to an acute dose and other mutants affected in NADPH generation were also affected in adaptation. These mutants overproduced reduced glutathione (GSH) but maintained normal cellular redox homeostasis. Over-production of GSH was not regulated by transcription of the gene encoding -glutamylcysteine-synthetase. The Skn7p transcription factor is therefore important for the adaptive response to oxidative stress-induced by H2O2, and NADPH generation is also required for adaptation.  The roles of sumoylation in stress responses and transcriptional regulation were examined by deleting the SUMO ligases Siz1p and Siz2p. Siz1p is required for tolerance to copper ions and DNA damage repair. Siz2p is involved in repression of stress responses, particularly oxidative stress and is required for activation of nucleotide and RNA metabolism, DNA processing and cell division. Both Siz1p and Siz2p act in parallel in the repressing heat-shock responses and in reducing chronological life span. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis showed that Siz1p and Siz2p repress the mitochondrial retrograde pathway and arginine biosynthesis, while activating some carbon and nitrogen metabolism genes. Sumoylation of proteins in the wild type was induced by nitrogen starvation or mitochondrial inhibition during the initial treatment. However, nitrogen starvation led to some protein degradation, while the SUMO-conjugated proteins were recycled in cells with disrupted mitochondrial functions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Biotechnology.</field><field name="subject">Oxidation, Physiological.</field><field name="subject">Stress (Physiology).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional dissection of insulin-regulated GLUT4 vesicle tethering and docking.</field><field name="creator">Lopez, Jamie Antonio, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The insulin-dependent uptake of glucose by adipose and muscle tissues is accomplished through the regulated vesicle trafficking of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane. The distal trafficking events comprising the tethering, docking and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane are poorly defined, but represent vital steps in this pathway. This dissertation encompasses a series of complementary studies that have provided new insights into how these events are regulated in the adipocyte.  The Sec1p homologue Munc18c, is believed to play a central role in the docking of GLUT4 vesicles by controlling SNARE complex assembly. Munc18c was shown to bind the t-SNARE Syntaxin4 and form a stable complex in vivo. Protein binding studies demonstrated that Munc18c interacts with Syntaxin4 via an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal binding mode and the formation of the Munc18c/Syntaxin4 hetero-dimer was shown to promote SNARE complex assembly. In contrast to previous reports, I propose that Munc18c is positive regulator of SNARE assembly and vesicle docking.  The exocyst complex is thought to promote the tethering of exocytic GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane. Yeast two-hybrid screens revealed interactions between the exocyst subunits Sec6 and Exo70 and the SNARE-associated proteins Munc18c and Snapin, respectively. Snapin was subsequently shown to have a novel role in GLUT4 trafficking. These interactions suggest Munc18c and Snapin provide a course for cross-talk between the exocyst complex and the SNAREs to stimulate GLUT4 vesicle tethering and docking.  In addition to its interactions with Munc18c and Snapin, the exocyst was also found to interact with the GTP-bound form of RalA, a small GTPase regulated by insulin. RalA was almost exclusively localised to the plasma membrane of the adipocyte and a novel role for the RalA/exocyst interaction in GLUT4 trafficking was demonstrated. Specifically, overexpression of a GTP-deficient RalA mutant significantly inhibited  insulin-stimulated GLUT4 appearance on the plasma membrane. In addition to its role in GLUT4 trafficking, a novel role for RalA was demonstrated in insulin release from pancreatic -cells, indicating that RalA may represent a universal component of regulated exocytosis.  It is becoming increasingly apparent that vesicle trafficking events from yeast to mammals rely on similar protein complexes which communicate through multiple protein interactions, ensuring vesicle transport is highly coupled. Similarly, the Munc18c studies demonstrate that while mammalian cells have evolved to fulfil specialised functions throughout the body, some proteins appear to have retained the biochemical properties of their ancestors, emphasing the importance of this family of proteins throughout eukaryotic vesicle transport. In contrast, proteins such as RalA have evolved only in higher eukaryotes and appear to play a universal role in vesicle transport despite vast differences in the specialised functioning of mammalian cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glucose -- Metabolism.</field><field name="subject">Insulin -- Physiological transport.</field><field name="subject">Cell membranes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural folates ?? method development, analysis andbioavailability of the most predominant 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in mixed diets in humans.</field><field name="creator">Vishnumohan, Shyamala, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Folate is an important B vitamin in the daily diet. It is not known to what extent naturally occurring folates in the mixed diet is bioavailable. Knowledge on to what extent the natural folates are absorbed would be best studied in a population that is not exposed to any folate fortificant. The aim of the present study was to study the bioavailability of dietary 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) in a whole day??s mixed diet relative to supplemental 5-MTHF in a selected Indian population. A dietary survey (n=200) conducted in South India, revealed a mean total intake of folate of 277+ 92.3 &#956;g/day (which is nearly 3 times higher than the current Indian Recommended Dietary Intake set to 100 &#956;g/day) based on the actual analysis of foods collected from a typical diet using a trienzyme technique followed by the microbiological assay. Further, the individual folate forms present in the foods were also analysed using a newly developed Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry LC-MS/MS). Quantification of folates was performed using internal standards. Good linearity was observed between 2-100 ng/Injection (Injection volume-100 &#956;L, R2: 0.98) that was suitable for analysis of foods (cereal, pulse, vegetables, milk based preparations and fruit) and blood samples (serum folate and erythrocyte folate) for use in bioavailability study. The folate intakes were reported to be higher (429+ 68.7 &#956;g/day) when the individual foods from the diet were analysed using the LC-MS/MS technique when compared to the values generated using microbiological assay. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the Indian diets were predominant in 5-MTHF and the important sources being cereals, pulses and vegetables. 22 human volunteers, aged 18-25 years were recruited in India to study the bioavailability of 5-MTHF. A randomized trial (12 weeks) was designed, where the subjects consumed 400 g 5-MTHF/day in the form of as supplemental drink or an experimental diet (400 g/day) consisting predominantly 5-MTHF (90%). Relative bioavailability of 5-MTHF was calculated by comparing the responses to food folate in relation to supplemental 5-MTHF, as indicated by the biomarkers. The relative bioavailability of food folate predominant in 5-MTHF was 41% based on serum folate indicator and 47% based on erythrocyte folate status. A mean increase of 60% was observed in the erythrocyte folate levels of the subjects consuming diets predominant in 5-MTHF in 12 weeks. Diets predominant in 5-MTHF have a good potential in improving the folate status of the population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fragile X mental retardation and fragile X chromosomes in the Indonesian population</field><field name="creator">Hussein, Sultana Muhammad, School of Pathology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Indonesian archipelago comprises more than 17,000 islands, inhabited by ~200 million people constituting more than 350 recognizable ethnic and tribal groups which can be classified into two broad ethno-linguistic groups [the Austronesian (AN) and non-Austronesian (NAN) speaking peoples] and 3 physical anthropology groups (Deutero Malay, Proto Malay and Papuan).  The origins of these groups are of considerable anthropological interest. The anthropology of Indonesia is extremely complex and still controversial. The present populations of Indonesia show very great diversity. The data presented below result from an investigation of the Fragile X A syndrome and the size and distribution of alleles at fragile sites on the X chromosome among Javanese males with developmental disability (DD) and unselected males from 10 major Indonesian ethnic groups.	The Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat array in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR-1 gene at Xq27.3. Normal X chromosomes have between 6-54 CGG trinucleotide repeats, whereas premutation alleles have 55-230 and full mutation alleles more than 230 repeats.  In a study of predominantly Caucasian males with intellectual disability, the prevalence of Fragile X syndrome is estimated to be approximately 1:4,000.  FRAXE mental retardation syndrome is caused by an expansion of a GCC trinucleotide repeat in the 5'UTR of FMR2 gene located 600 kb telomeric to FMR1. The prevalence of FMR2 is 1-2 per 100,000 live births. FMR2 common alleles consist of 11-30 GGC repeats; intermediate alleles between 31-60 GCC repeats; premutation alleles with 61-200 repeats and full mutation alleles have over 200 repeats with attendant methylation of the repeat array	The first Indonesian screening program aimed at determining the presence and prevalence of fragile XA syndrome among individuals with mild DD (IQ above 50) from special schools (N=205) and isolated areas (N=50) of Java was undertaken in 1994-1996 by cytogenetic and molecular studies. In this first study 4 fragile X positive children were found among 255 males with DD. The estimated prevalence of fragile-X in males with mild DD from special schools was 1.95% (5/205) and the overall prevalence was 1.57% (4/255).	The number of trinucleotide repeats in the 5' untranslated regions of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes were determined by PCR in 254 Fragile XA-negative Javanese male children with DD. The distribution of FMR1 and FMR2 trinucleotide repeat alleles was found to be significantly different in the Indonesian population with DD compared to that in equivalent Caucasian populations. The trimodal distribution of Indonesian FMR1 alleles (29, 30 and 36 repeats) is largely in agreement with findings from other Asian populations).  This provides supportive evidence that the origin of Indonesians could be the same as that of the Chinese and Japanese. 	Sequence analysis was performed on the trinucleotide repeat arrays of the 27 individuals' FMR1 alleles in the 'grey zone' (35-52 repeats). The identification of 16 unrelated individuals with a (CGG)36 allele that also contains a (CGG)6 segment [(CGG)9AGG(CGG)9AGG(CGG)6 AGG(CGG)9 or 9A9A6A9 pattern] is in agreement with earlier observations in the Japanese population.  It is proposed that this FMR1 array pattern may be specific for Asian populations and that Javanese and Japanese populations may have arisen from a single progenitor population. The presence of pure 25, 33 and 34 CGGs in FMR1 alleles with 36, 44 and 45 repeats respectively, suggests that these may represent alleles at high risk for instability and may therefore be at early stages of expansion to a premutation. The lack of the characteristic (CGG)6 in all three alleles with ?? 25 pure CGG arrays suggests that the most common Asian 36 repeat allele is not predisposed to slippage expansion. Seven of the 8 alleles with 36 CGG repeats could be sequenced.  Seven of 36 CGG repeats FMR1 alleles from the Hiri population has been sequenced and 4 alleles indicated 9A9A6A9 pattern, 1 sample with 10A25 pattern  Two of the remaining alleles showed 12A6A6A9 structure, which consisted of a tandem duplication of the (CGG)6 segment.  The presence of a tandem duplication of (CGG)6 segments has never been reported in any other population.	The other major findings of this study are that FRAXE syndrome is a rare cause of developmental disability in this predominantly-Javanese population.  The most common FMR2 (GCC)20 allele in this selected Asian population is significantly longer than that previously reported for Caucasian populations.  There was a weak correlation between the overall length of the FMR1 and FMR2 repeat arrays within the normal range (Spearman's Rank Correlation = 0.130, p-value=0.042) in the Indonesian population, which have been no previous associations reported for alleles within the normal range. 	One approach to studying the origins of the human populations is to study the genetic structure of polymorphic alleles such as those at the FMR1 locus and its linked microsatellite markers DXS548 and FRAXAC1.  Length polymorphisms of the FMR1 gene (CGG)n repeat array, DXS548 and FRAXAC1 were studied in a total of 1,008 unselected males from 10 different Indonesian ethnic groups.  FMR1 alleles were identified ranging from 8 to 57 CGG repeats. The most common CGG repeat allele was 29 (45.6%) followed by 30 (27.4%) and 36 repeats (8.0%). One hundred and forty four grey zone (3-52 CGG) alleles were found in the study population.  Four people of the same ethnic group from an isolated island in Eastern Indonesia (Hiri, Ternate), a representative of the NAN ethnolinguistic group, had CGG repeat lengths of 55-57.  The prevalence of these alleles is estimated to be 3.3% (4/120) in the population of Hiri or 0.4% (4/1008) of whole Indonesian population.	Thirteen different alleles were found at the DXS548 locus, of which allele numbers 7 [194 bp] (44.1%), 6.5 [195bp] (43.5%) and 6 [196bp] (7.5%) are the most common.  Seven rare alleles, some of which have not been previously found in Asian peoples were also identified (190, 191,192, 193, 197,198, 199, 202, 204 and 206) and accounted for 3.9% of the total.  The odd number alleles were dominantly found in this study whereas almost none found in Caucasian. The finding of many "odd numbered" alleles DXS548 has never been found in other Asian population and has only been documented extremely rarely in Caucasians and Africans.	Five different alleles of FRAXAC1 identified with alleles D [106 bp] (62.2%) and C [108bp] (35.6%) accounting for 97.8% of FRAXAC1 alleles in the population.  Three rare alleles (104, 110, 112 bp = 2.2%) were identified that have not been previously found in other Asian populations (1-3).  There is a striking linkage disequilibrium of FMR1 alleles with FRAXAC1 (p=0.0001), 88% of 29 (CGG)n repeats alleles associated with FRAXAC1 allele D (106bp) versus only 17% with the 30 (CGG)n repeat alleles, which is in agreement with other studies.  The value of D' was calculated to be 0.7.	The longer alleles of both DXS548 and FRAXAC1 were found mostly in the NAN ethnolinguistic group. Moreover the Irian Jaya people also showed a higher percentage of people with 30 CGG repeats and the 108 bp FRAXAC1.  The Eastern Indonesian NAN groups demonstrate a different genetic background probably due to the contribution of Melanesian peoples.	The Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) identified that the vast majority of genetic diversity occurs within, rather than between, ethnic groups.  These data are consistent with a model where there is sufficient migration (~20 per generation) between populations to minimise differentiation of population through genetic drift. The results obtained are consistent with three clusters of populations that share similar allele frequencies at the fragile X locus.  The most clearly defined cluster is based in the east of Indonesia and includes the two Irian populations, Minahasans and Hiri. A surprising finding was that the Minahasan who are Deutero-Malay in origin and physical appearance are genetically closer to the Irianese.  This may reflect the admixture of Melanesian alleles or other eastern Indonesian alleles as a result of their geographic location in that part of Indonesia.	The second major cluster is largely based in the west of the country and is composed of the following Deutero-Malay populations; Javanese, Balinese, Acehnese but which also includes people from Ternate (not including those from Hiri).  Using Delta Mu and Nei's genetic distance for FMR1 locus in this study the Javanese were shown to have the closest distance to Balinese which is consistent with anthropological data and with published data.	The third group is a "western and central" group composed of Bimanese, Dayak and Sundanese who share some features of the western and eastern clusters but mostly resemble the western Indonesian populations. Bima is located in the lesser Sunda in between west Indonesia and east Indonesia. The Bimanese are of mixed Deutero &amp; Proto Malay origin that is consistent with their geographic location.	The Bataks are distinctive and sit somewhat apart in this scheme. In this study, Bataks were found not to resemble the other Proto-Malay group studied (the Dayak).  The Dayaks were found to have fewer alleles than the Bataks at FRAXAC1 and DXS548.  In all four methods of calculating genetic distance Bataks showed a large genetic distance to almost all other ethnic groups.	There are differences in allele frequency between east and west Indonesia as well as other Asian nations, but the genetic similarities between these groups are also very impressive.  The findings from this study are consistent with other genetic anthropological evidence that the people of Indonesia have the same origin as North-east Asian groups.  This model is referred to as the "express train from Taiwan" in which the Austronesian speakers are proposed to have radiated from Taiwan bringing the Malayo-Polynesian language group to the Philippines, Borneo and Sulawesi around 5000-4500 B.P.E. However Richards et al.(1998) have used the diversity in the mtDNA D Loop to propose an alternative to the "express train" model.  The "two train7quot; model proposes that the Austronesian languages originated within eastern Indonesia during the Pleistocene era and spread through Melanesia and into the remote Pacific within the past 6,000 years.  Unfortunately the high migration rates between population groups that were demonstrated in this thesis and the known migration patterns of populations through Indonesia preclude determining whether the observed allelic heterogeneity is a function of the original population or due to the admixture of several gene pools in more recent times.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">X linked mental retardation</field><field name="subject">Fragile X syndrome</field><field name="subject">Mental retardation Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multilevel study of collective efficacy, self-mental models, and collective cognition in university student group activities</field><field name="creator">Alavi, Seyyed Babak, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main goal of this study was to identify some determinants of collective efficacy in small groups. A multilevel approach was used to posit hypotheses and research questions relating individual and shared beliefs of collective efficacy to collective cognition activities, task interdependence, self-efficacy for group work, and collective orientation. A two-phase longitudinal design was employed. The sample comprised 270 university students, enrolled in seven courses and involved in 86 work groups in both phases of the study. All groups were required to perform interdependent academic tasks. The results of multiple regression analysis of aggregated variables provided some evidence that the more group members perceived themselves to be interdependent in the early stages of group work and assigned their tasks interdependently during group processes, the more likely they developed high collective efficacy in the final stages of group work. Collective efficacy was also related to the group average of self-efficacy for group work when task interdependence was high. Multilevel analysis was also used. These results showed that variation at the individual level was considerable, and there was significant but relatively little variation at the group level, with small effect sizes, for a few variables including collective efficacy. Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the theoretical framework at the individual level after accounting for group level variation. The results suggested that integration and constructive evaluation of ideas during group processes and self-efficacy for group work may have been determinants of collective efficacy at the individual level. Moreover, collective efficacy at the individual level was related to an interdependent perception of self in relation to other group members. The results suggest that helping group members learn how to evaluate and integrate each other???s ideas during group activities, and perceive themselves to be interdependent may enhance group capabilities for performing tasks. In addition, improving students??? self-efficacy for group work was identified as a key factor, as it may enhance a sense of interdependence among group members, improve the extent to which group members participate in integrating and evaluating ideas, and increase the whole group???s capabilities for performing tasks.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">collective efficacy</field><field name="subject">self-efficacy for group work</field><field name="subject">multilevel analysis</field><field name="subject">collective cognition</field><field name="subject">mental model</field><field name="subject">shared mental model</field><field name="subject">shared cognition</field><field name="subject">collective orientation</field><field name="subject">allocentrism</field><field name="subject">idiocentrism</field><field name="subject">individualism</field><field name="subject">collectivism</field><field name="subject">team</field><field name="subject">group</field><field name="subject">small group research</field><field name="subject">small group</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Group work in education</field><field name="subject">College students.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Macromolecular fouling during membrane filtration of complex fluids</field><field name="creator">Ye, Yun, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Macromolecular components, including protein and polysaccharides, are viewed as one type of major foulants in the complex feed membrane filtration systems such as membrane bioreactor (MBR). In this thesis, the mechanisms of macromolecular fouling including protein and polysaccharide in the complex feed solution are explored by using Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and alginate as model solution. During the filtration of BSA and washed yeast with 0.22 ????m PVDF membrane, it was found that the critical flux of mixture solution was controlled by washed yeast concentration while the existence of BSA significantly changed the cake reversibility of much larger particles. The fouling mechanisms of alginate, as a model polysaccharide solution, were investigated both in dead end and crossflow membrane filtration. In the dead end experiments, it was found that the cake model appears to fit the entire range of the ultrafiltration data while the consecutive standard pore blocking model and cake model are more applicable to microfiltration membranes. The alginate was featured with high specific cake resistance and low compressibility despite some variations between different membranes. The specific cake resistance ( c ) is similar to c of BSA and actual extracellular polymer substance (EPS) in MBR systems reported in the literature, and higher than that of many colloidal particles. In a system contained alginate-particles mixture, it was found that the existence of alginate dramatically increased the cake specific resistance and decreased the cake compressibility. The fouling mechanism of alginate was also studied using long term cross flow filtration under subcritical flux. A two-stage TMP profile similar to that typically observed in MBR was obtained, confirming the important role of EPS during membrane fouling in MBR. In addition to adsorption, trace deposition of alginate also contributed to the initial slow TMP increase during the subcritical filtration. TMP increase during the long-term filtration was found not only due to the increase of the amount of deposition, but also the increase of specific cake resistance. A combined standard pore blocking and cake filtration model, using a critical pore size for the transition time determination, was developed and fit the experimental results well.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="subject">Membrane reactors</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="subject">Membrane filters</field><field name="subject">Membrane separation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cultural reinvention of planning</field><field name="creator">Young, Gregory, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Culture is expanding and has greater weight and explanatory potential in our culturalised age. Following the earlier literature of the ???cultural turn???, culture is now perceived as ubiquitous in society, the economy, and theory, and with the capacity to intervene on itself. Further, it may be seen to characterise both the nature and the progressive potential of a range of contemporary social and intellectual technologies such as planning, education, health, and organisational development.  While this general process of ???culturalisation??? proceeds apace, the capacity of culture to act as an organising idea and category for sectors such as planning is still largely underdeveloped, most particularly in planning itself. A new Culturised Model for planning that is reflexive and ethical is proposed. Differentiated from the trend to culturalisation and its association with commodification, ???culturisation??? has true sustainable and transformational potential.  The thesis consists of three main parts ??? each of three chapters - with a substantial scenesetting Introduction and a Conclusion. Part One examines culture and planning, Part Two develops a new Culturised Model for planning, and Part Three illustrates the Model.  In Part One the grounds of culturisation are prepared by: 1) describing our culturalised age; 2) developing a new positionality for planning; 3) presenting a critical analysis of neomodern and postmodern planning theory; and 4) outlining an original history of culture and planning in the 20th and 21st centuries.  In Part Two a practical Culturised Model for planning is developed, based on the three elements of 1) principles for culture; 2) a planner???s ???literacy trinity???; and 3) a methodology. The Model employs an integrated concept of culture and an integrated approach to research, and is applicable to the full spectrum of planning forms, scales and purposes. In Part Three the Culturised Model is illustrated in principle through a range of global examples, and in specific terms, for two major Australian places. The first study illustrates culture and urban and regional planning for metropolitan Sydney, NSW, at four nested geographical scales. The second illustrates strategic planning in its aspatial form for the Port Arthur Historic Site, in Tasmania, a major international convict heritage site proposed for UNESCO World Heritage listing.  The thesis represents an original multi-dimensional synthesis on culture and planning. It also presents a ???breakthrough??? paradigm for the sustainable integration of culture in planning, previously only foreshadowed in the planning literature, and developed in randomised practices internationally.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">City planning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model studies of the cub-histidine-tyrosine centre in cytochrome c oxidase</field><field name="creator">Lee, Sang Tae, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the synthesis and copper coordination chemistry of covalently-linked aryl-imidazole derivatives designed as models for the crosslinked imidazole-phenol sidechains of the His-Tyr cofactor in the CcO. Three new imidazole- (HL1 - HL3) and three new indole- (HL4 - H2L6) containing tripodal ligands were synthesised. The conjugate addition of an imidazole to activated quinone derivatives was developed as a new route to organic models for the Tyr His cofactor. Two monodentate imidazole-aryl, Im-hq(OH)2 and Im-ArOH, and an imidazole-quinone, Im bq were obtained using this route. The X-ray crystal structure of Im-hq(OH)2.EtOH was determined. The route was also used to give new chelating ligands, H2L10 and HL12, containing a cross-linked imidazole-phenol surrogate for the Tyr244-His240 cofactor.            Copper complexes of Im-hq(OH)2, Im-bq, Im-ArOH, H2L10-HL12, and HL1-H2L6 were prepared, and the X-ray crystal structures of [Cu(terpy)(Im-bq)][BF4]2 and five other copper complexes were determined. The physiochemical properties of the copper complexes were characterized by FT-IR, UV-Vis-NIR, EPR and (spectro)electrochemical studies. Key results include: the oxidation of Im-ArO- anion affords the semiquinone radical, Im-sq(4OH)(1O??????), in a hydrous solvent. However, the oxidations of neutral Im-ArOH and [Cu(tpa)(Im-ArOH)]2+ produce the corresponding phenoxy radical species that rapidly and reversibly dimerise to give quinol cyclohexadienone, QCHD, dimers. Significantly [Cu(tpa)(Im-sq(4OH)(1O??????))]2+ was EPR silent, perhaps due to antiferromagnetic coupling between the Cu(II) (S=1/2)  and semiquinonyl radical (S=1/2) centres. Deprotonation of the hydroquinone in [Cu(tpa)(Im-hq(OH)2]2+ produces the hydroquinone dianion which reduces the Cu(II) centre. The semiquinone radical is coordinatively labile and dissociates from the Cu(I) centre. The biological implications of these results are mentioned.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytochrome C oxidase</field><field name="subject">Histidine</field><field name="subject">Tyrosine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Plurality of Identities: Ulster Protestantism in Contemporary Northern Irish Drama</field><field name="creator">Macbeth, Georgia, School of Theatre, Film &amp; Dance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which Ulster Protestant identity has been explored in contemporary Northern Irish drama. The insecurity of the political and cultural status of Ulster Protestants from the Home Rule Crises up until Partition led to the construction and maintenance of a distinct and unified Ulster Protestant identity.  This identity was defined by concepts such as loyalty, industriousness and ???Britishness???.  It was also defined by a perceived opposite ??? the Catholicism, disloyalty and ???Irishness??? of the Republic.  When the Orange State began to fragment in the late 1960s and early 1970s, so did notions of this singular Ulster Protestant identity.  With the onset of the Troubles in 1969 came a parallel questioning and subversion of this identity in Northern Irish drama.  This was a process which started with Sam Thompson???s Over the Bridge in 1960, but which began in earnest with Stewart Parker???s Spokesong in 1975.  This thesis examines Parker???s approach and subsequent approaches by other dramatists to the question of Ulster Protestant identity.  It begins with the antithetical pronouncements of Field Day Theatre Company, which were based in an inherently Northern Nationalist ideology.  Here, the Ulster Protestant community was largely ignored or essentialised.  Against this Northern Nationalist ideology represented by Field Day have come broadly revisionist approaches, reflecting the broader cultural context of this thesis.  Ulster Protestant identity has been explored through issues of history and myth, ethnicity, class, gender and sexuality.  More recent explorations of Ulster Protestantism have also added to this diversity by presenting the little acknowledged viewpoint of extreme loyalism.  Dramatists examined in this thesis include Stewart Parker, Christina Reid, Frank McGuinness, Bill Morrison, Ron Hutchinson, Marie Jones, Graham Reid, Robin Glendinning and Gary Mitchell.  The work of Charabanc Theatre Company is also discussed.  What results from their efforts is a diverse and complex Ulster Protestant community.  This thesis argues that the concept of a singular Ulster Protestant identity, defined by its loyalty and Britishness, is fragmented, leading to a plurality of Ulster Protestant identities.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English drama</field><field name="subject">Northern Irish authors</field><field name="subject">History and criticism</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">Protestantism and literature</field><field name="subject">Ulster</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pyrolysis of Fine Coal Particles at High Heating Rate and Pressure</field><field name="creator">Mill, Christopher John, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">High-intensity pyrolysis, rapid heating in an inert gas atmosphere at up to 20 atm pressure, of 6 Australian coals was examined to gain further insight into high-intensity processes such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC). Experiments focussed on pyrolysis in a specially developed Wire Mesh Reactor (WMR). The particle temperature lagged that of the mesh by 0.2 seconds at a heating rate of 100??~C s -1 and was predicted by modelling. This is part of the reason the volatile yield (VY) results for 10 s hold-time at ???b1.7 wt% daf of coal, is much more reproducible than 1 s hold-time experiments at ???b4.2 wt% daf of coal. Four coals of the same rank did not behave identically when heated. Three of the coals had a pyrolysis VY the same as the proximate VM when heated to 100??~C at 1 atm but the fourth, higher inertinite coal had a 1 atm pyrolysis VY 90% of its proximate VM. All four coals of similar rank had a significant decrease in VY, between 10 and 20 wt% daf of coal, with pressure increasing from 1 to 20 atm. The two lower rank coals showed less decrease in VY with increasing pressure than the higher rank and higher inertinite coals. The lower decrease in VY with increased pressure was mostly attributed to the lower inertinite levels for both the coals of similar rank and VM, and the coals of lower rank. Char characteristics examined focussed on pore Surface Area (SA). For high intensity WMR and Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) pyrolysis experiments CO2 SA for char from a particular coal was similar but the BET   SA different. This was due to the char in the WMR experiments having longer to form larger pores determined by BET N2 SA. Both the N2 and CO2 SA was more than an order of magnitude greater than for low intensity pyrolysis char. This highlights that the WMR can be used to attain char with similar CO2 SA characteristics as other high intensity pyrolysis experiments and to provide a more meaningful insight into char reactivity than low intensity chars do.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coal Combustion</field><field name="subject">Pyrolysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface grafting of polymers via living radical polymerization techniques; polymeric supports for combinatorial chemistry</field><field name="creator">Zwaneveld, Nikolas Anton Amadeus, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of living radical polymerization methods has shown significant potential to control grafting of polymers from inert polymeric substrates. The objective of this thesis is to create advanced substrates for use in  combinatorial chemistry applications through the use of g-radiation as a radical source, and the use of RAFT, ATRP and RATRP living radical techniques to control grafting polymerization. The substrates grafted were polypropylene SynPhase lanterns from Mimotopes and are intended to be used as supports for combinatorial chemistry. ATRP was used to graft polymers to SynPhase lanterns using a technique where the lantern was functionalized by exposing the lanterns to gamma-radiation from a 60Co radiation source in the presence of carbon tetra-bromide, producing short chain polystyrene tethered bromine atoms, and also with CBr4 directly functionalizing the surface. Styrene was then grafted off these lanterns using ATRP.  MMA was graft to the surface of SynPhase lanterns, using g-radiation initiated RATRP at room temperature. It was found that the addition of the thermal initiator, AIBN, successfully increased the concentration of radicals to a level where we could achieve proper control of the polymerization.  RAFT was used to successfully control the grafting of styrene, acrylic acid and N,N???-dimethylacrylamide to polypropylene SynPhase Lanterns via a -initiated RAFT agent mediated free radical polymerization process using cumyl phenyldithioacetate and cumyl dithiobenzoate RAFT agents.  Amphiphilic brush copolymers were produced with a novel combined RAFT and ATRP system. Polystyrene-co-poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) created using gamma-radiation and controlled with the RAFT agent PEPDA was used as a backbone. The VBC moieties were then used as initiator sites for the ATRP grafting of t-BA to give a P(t-BA) brush that was then hydrolyzed to produce a PAA brush polymer.  FMOC loading tests were conducted on all these lanterns to assess their effectiveness as combinatorial chemistry supports. It was found that the loading could be controlled by adjusting the graft ratio of the lanterns and had a comparable loading to those commercially produced by Mimotopes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ATRP</field><field name="subject">RAFT</field><field name="subject">Radiation</field><field name="subject">polymerization</field><field name="subject">grafting</field><field name="subject">living radical polymerization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The weakly nonlinear stability of an oscillatory fluid flow</field><field name="creator">Reid, Francis John Edward, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">A weakly nonlinear stability analysis was conducted for the flow induced in an incompressible, Newtonian, viscous fluid lying between two infinite parallel plates which form a channel. The plates are oscillating synchronously in simple harmonic motion. The disturbed velocity of the flow was written in the form of a series in powers of a parameter  which is a measure of the distance away from the linear theory neutral conditions. The individual terms of this series were decomposed using Floquet theory and Fourier series in time. The equations at second order and third order in  were derived, and solutions for the Fourier coefficients were found using pseudospectral methods for the spatial variables. Various alternative methods of computation were applied to check the validity of the results obtained. The Landau equation for the amplitude of the disturbance was obtained, and the existence of equilibrium amplitude solutions inferred. The values of the coefficients in the Landau equation were calculated for the nondimensional channel half-widths h for the cases h = 5, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16. It was found that equilibrium amplitude solutions exist for points in wavenumber Reynolds number space above the smooth portion of the previously determined linear stability neutral curve in all the cases examined. Similarly, Landau coefficients were calculated on a special feature of the neutral curve (called a ???finger???) for the case h = 12. Equilibrium amplitude solutions were found to exist at points inside the finger, and in a particular region outside near the top of the finger. Traces of the x-components of the disturbance velocities have been presented for a range of positions across the channel, together with the size of the equilibrium amplitude at these positions. As well, traces of the x-component of the velocity of the disturbed flow and traces of the velocity of the basic flow have been given for comparison at a particular position in the channel.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Navier-Stokes equations -- Numerical solutions.</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics.</field><field name="subject">Fluid mechanics -- Mathematics.</field><field name="subject">Stability.</field><field name="subject">Boundary layer.</field><field name="subject">Reynolds number.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mesoporous, microporous and nanocrystalline materials as lithium battery electrodes.</field><field name="creator">Milne, Nicholas A, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study it was proposed to investigate the use of 3D metal oxides (specifically titanium oxides) as potential electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. Three different approaches were taken: mesoporous materials to increase the surface area and improve the capacity; nanocrystalline materials to increase the surface area and to investigate any changes that may occur using nanocrystals; and microporous materials that are more open, allowing rapid diffusion of lithium and higher capacities.  Of the three categories of materials studies, mesoporous TiO2 was the least promising with low reversible capacities (20 mAh??g-1) due to densification resulting in a loss of surface area.  In nanocrystalline rutile an irreversible phase change occurred upon initial intercalation, however after this intercalation occurred reversibly in a single phase mechanism giving capacities of 100 mAh??g-1. A trend in intercalation potential was observed with crystallite size that was related to the ability of the structure to relax and accept lithium. Doping of rutile yielded no real improvement. Brookite gave only low capacities from a single phase intercalation mechanism. TiO2 films produced by a novel electrochemical technique showed that while amorphous films give greater capacities, more crystalline (anatase) films give greater reversibility.  Overall, microporous titanosilicates showed the most promise with sitinakite giving a reversible capacity of 80 mAh??g-1 after twenty cycles or double this when dried. The intercalation was found to occur by two steps that generate large changes in crystallite size explaining the capacity fade witnessed. While doping did not improve the performance, cation exchange has proven beneficial.  The remaining titanosilicates did not perform as well as sitinakite, however a trend was observed in the intercalation potentials with the wavenumber of the Ti-O Raman stretch. This was due to the covalent nature of the bonding. Upon reduction an electron is added to the bond meaning the energy of the bond determines intercalation potential.  Overall, most promise was shown by the microporous titanosilicates. The capacities of sitinakite after drying, are comparable to those of the "zero strain" material Li4Ti5O12. Investigation of the titanosilicates and their ion-exchanged derivatives is a promising path for new lithium-ion battery electrode materials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrodes, Oxide.</field><field name="subject">Lithium cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of a New Measure of Linear Accelerator Throughput in Radiation Oncology Treatment Delivery - The Basic Treatment Equivalent (B.T.E.).</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Geoffrey Paul, SWSAHS Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The measurement of productivity in health care is difficult. Studies in various specialty disciplines of medicine have identified that the variation in complexities (casemix) between departments or hospitals will vary and therefore will affect any basic productivity statistics that are produced. Radiation oncology is a discipline of medicine where no such studies into radiotherapy casemix variations and the effect that these may have on productivity measures have been performed, despite the high capital expenditure involved in the delivery of radiotherapy.  Radiation oncology productivity on linear accelerators is currently measured by the number of patients treated or number of treatment fields treated per unit time (usually per hour). These statistics have been collected for many years and productivity assessments were made on the variations in these statistics that exist between departments. However, these statistics do not consider the variations in casemix that occur between departments. These complexity differences may be quite marked and therefore may strongly influence the ability of a department to achieve a high patient or treatment field throughput. This may be seen as 'reduced productivity' with no consideration of the complexity of the caseload seen in the department. In addition, future technological changes that improve patient outcome may be introduced. These changes may make treatment more complex. Using older measures of productivity such as fields per hour or patients per hour will not consider these technological changes and the subsequent changes in complexity and hence departments may be seen as less productive in the future using current methods of analysis unless a more valid measure of productivity that considers complexity variations is introduced.  There have only been 3 previous attempts at developing measures of linear accelerator productivity. Each of these models have been developed empirically and have not been clinically validated. No previous attempts have been made in determining a scientifically-derived complexity model that considers the variations in treatment technique.  This thesis describes research performed between 1995 and 2001. This research study???s primary aims were to study the factors that affect radiotherapy treatment time and treatment complexity and to develop a model of linear accelerator productivity that does consider complexity variations in radiotherapy treatment delivery. This model is called the Basic Treatment Equivalent (B.T.E.). This series of trials examines the old models of linear accelerator productivity, describes the derivation and validation of the BTE model both in Australasia and the United Kingdom, identifies the factors that contribute to treatment time and treatment complexity, describes the development of a pilot model of productivity of gynaecological brachytherapy and outpatient chemotherapy using similar BTE methodology, discusses the potential uses of the BTE model, recent independent reviews of BTE by other groups, and the advantages and disadvantages of using such a model.  This research has shown that it is possible to identify the various factors that contribute to treatment time and treatment complexity and to derive a model of linear accelerator productivity that considers the variations in complexity. The BTE model has been clinically validated in Australia, New Zealand and a couple of departments in the United Kingdom and Canada and has been adopted as a new measure by various groups. It requires regular updating to maintain currency particularly as there are frequent improvements in radiation treatment technology. Future studies should identify the differences these technological enhancements make to productivity. The BTE derived from outpatient chemotherapy delivery and gynaecological brachytherapy delivery shows promise although these models require further research with the assistance of other departments.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer - Radiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Oncology</field><field name="subject">Linear accelerators in medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a new framework for a House Rating Scheme (HRS)</field><field name="creator">Kordjamshidi, Maria, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">There has long been concern that rating the thermal performance of buildings on the basis of predicted normalized energy requirement (MJ/m2) is inappropriate for achieving overall energy efficient design of houses, mainly due to the inability of such schemes to deal with the evaluation of passive architectural design in the form of free running buildings. This study, investigating the shortcomings in the current rating schemes, hypothesizes that the main reason for that inability is due to significant differences between efficient design for free running and conditioned houses. It also suggests that a multiple occupancy scenario, involving variable occupation times and zones, is an important parameter for improving the accuracy of any building evaluation system.  The study aims to propose a new method for House Rating Schemes in which the efficiency of a house design will be evaluated with reference to its thermal performance in both free running and conditioned operation modes. By attributing more value to the performance of houses in the free running than the conditioned operation, it is assumed that policy objectives for reducing energy demand for space heating and cooling in the residential building sector are more likely to be achieved.  Simulation was used to compare the predicted thermal performances of houses in free running and conditioned operation modes for the moderate climates of Sydney and Canberra. Parametric sensitivity analysis and multivariate regression analysis have been employed and point to the following results.  The reliability of a free running rating scheme, in terms of addressing energy efficient aspects, as compared to the current energy based rating schemes, is demonstrated. The research illustrates significant differences between efficient design for conditioned houses and for free running houses. The findings strongly suggest the necessity of developing a new regulatory framework for reducing energy demand in the housing sector. Utilizing these findings, an aggregation of two rating systems for the purpose of creating a new house rating framework has been developed. It is assumed that this research approach is likely to deliver significant benefits in terms of reduction in energy demand and increased sustainability, if it is employed as a basis for House Ratings Schemes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy auditing.</field><field name="subject">Housing -- Australia -- Energy conservation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an integrated approach to understanding, managing and designing strategies and recycled organics filtration treatment system to control regional heavy metal contamination of stormwater.</field><field name="creator">Seelsaen, Nida, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Urban stormwater runoff is recognised as a substantial source of heavy metal contamination, which adversely impacts on water quality of regional receiving waterways. Conventional treatment of urban runoff mostly involves a filtration system using sand to retain particulate matters. Sand provides limited sorption of dissolved metals and the inclusion of commercial sorbents to these treatment systems is not cost effective due to the concentration of dissolved metals in the runoff. Recycled organic materials are by-products or waste from industrial or agricultural operations, and could be alternative low cost sorbents for stormwater treatment systems. The use of recycled sorbents also provides added value to the waste materials and reduces landfill disposal.            The research explores the application of compost, zeolite, ash, and recyclable waste in urban runoff treatment, especially for dissolved metal removal. The research combines the two aspects of experimental studies and management analysis to develop a holistic approach to heavy metal control in urban stormwater systems. Experimental results of batch sorption test show that compost is suitable for removing dissolve copper in stormwater treatment. The comparison of the different mixing ratios between compost and glass beads in column test evaluates the optimum mixing sorbent and performance over a long period for copper removal. Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) of copper has been performed in the Upper Parramatta River Catchment, Sydney to identify the sources of copper associated with runoff, effect of using waste material such as compost in urban stormwater treatment and the copper load in urban stormwater runoff. This case study shows the relationship between copper input, copper stock, sorbent type and urban stormwater quality control in the system boundary of the catchment. Different scenarios of source control are evaluated to control copper load from the different sources. Source control focusing on roads and vehicles is the most effective copper control strategy. The combination of source control and stormwater treatment reduces copper in stormwater and receiving water. The thesis applies the analysis from SFA and experimental results to derive both a regional system-wide solution with source control, and an improved design of stormwater treatment for heavy metal removal using recycled organics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heavy metals.</field><field name="subject">Stormwater infiltration.</field><field name="subject">Compost.</field><field name="subject">Runoff.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probing the electrochemical double layer: an examination of how the physical and electrical structure affects heterogeneous electron transfer</field><field name="creator">Eggers, Paul Kahu, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this research the environmental effects related to the position of a redox moiety with the electrochemical double layer were studied. This project was made possible with the synthesis of a series of lengths of ferrocene derived alkanethiols, a series of lengths of ferrocene derived norbornylogous bridges and a series of lengths of anthraquinone derived norbornylogous bridges. The series of ferrocene derived alkanethiols were used to study the effect of gradually varying the polarity of the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) surface on the standard electron transfer rate constant and formal potential. This was achieved by varying the portion of hydroxyl to methyl terminated alkanethiol diluent in the SAM preparation step. It was found that the formal potential increased with a decreasing proportion of hydroxyl terminated diluent and increasing length of the diluent. For pure hydroxyl terminated diluent the formal potential was relatively independent of length. It was found that the rate constant increased for short alkane chain lengths with decreasing proportion of hydroxyl terminated diluent. However, it decreased in magnitude with long alkane chain lengths for low proportions of hydroxyl terminated diluent. The norbornylogous bridges were shown to stand proud above the diluent with a similar tilt angle as the alkanethiol diluent. The ferrocene derived norbornylogous bridges showed hydroxyl terminated monolayers had a slower rate constant then methyl terminated diluents independent of length and that it is highly probable that an alkane bridged redox moiety is located very close to the surface of the monolayer. SAMs were created with the ferrocene of the ferrocene derived norbornylogous bridges located at various heights above the monolayers surface. This was done by using various lengths of hydroxyl terminated diluent. It was found that the rate constant and the formal potential decreased with height above the surface. Interfacial potential distribution was used to account for this and to estimate a ??true?? formal potential. The anthraquinone derived norbornylogous bridges were tested at various pH values and heights above the surface. It was found that an accurate estimate for the electron transfer mechanism can not be made for surface bound species due to the effects of interfacial potential distribution. They demonstrated a novel technique for estimating the point of zero charge of the electrode.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ferrocene</field><field name="subject">Electron Transfer</field><field name="subject">Double Layer</field><field name="subject">Anthraquinone</field><field name="subject">Norbornylogous Bridge</field><field name="subject">Electrochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New process development of dense gas technology for the processing of pharmaceuticals</field><field name="creator">Sih, Roderick Peng Tze, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Drug re-engineering is an effective method for engineering existing products in alternative dosage forms and with enhanced pharmacokinetics.  Insulin for the management of diabetic symptoms is an ideal candidate for re-engineering.  Current subcutaneous therapy results in low patient compliance and is ineffective in meeting the physiological need for post-prandial insulin.  Implementation of dose titration for more efficient blood-glucose management is also inconvenient and uncomfortable.  Inhaled insulin is presented as a superior alternative to current therapy.  The lungs offer excellent access to the circulatory system.  Aerosols suspended in inspired air may deposit on lung epithelia and be available for systemic absorption.  To evade the defense mechanism of the human respiratory tract, particle sizes have traditionally been minimized to achieve necessary aerosol performance.  Recent developments indicate that more efficient performance augmentation may also be achieved by decreasing the bulk density of powders and modifying surface characteristics.  Light and fluffy powders with rough surfaces experience much higher drag forces within an airstream.  The Atomized Rapid Injection for Solvent Extraction (ARISE) process is a unique precipitation platform devised by incorporating a rapid injection technique for energetic solution delivery into supercritical fluid (SCF) media to effect recovery of previously dissolved pharmaceutical compounds.  The quasi-instantaneous delivery of solutions alleviates the drawbacks of the use of capillary nozzles or micro-orifices, gradual elution and mixing controlled precipitation kinetics in existing SCF precipitation techniques.  Most importantly, the energetic release of solution into SCF media effects supersaturation over a much larger spatial volume and promotes the homogeneous precipitation of low bulk density powders.  ARISE processed insulin powders displayed characteristics that were highly influenced by anti-solvent conditions and powders of different qualities were obtained as a function of anti-solvent pressures.  At lower anti-solvent pressures, powders of narrow particle size distribution were achieved, an indication of homogeneous supersaturation levels within processing.

Challenging structural conventions of research into aesthetic development in art, a realist philosophical framework provides a neutral space within which the ontological basis for children's aesthetic concepts of pictorial meaning and value can be analysed, and developmental differences mapped. The study employs an analytical schema which brings together analytical tools borrowed from Feldman's &#145;ontic dumping&#146; and Wollheim's twofolded &#145;seeing-in.&#146; This schema is used to classify qualitative changes in concepts of pictorial value and meaning in three groups of children aged 6, 9, and 12, and two teachers, as employed in the experimental curation of an exhibition of portrait paintings. The curatorial policy developed by children from each group, in justification of their choice of eight pictures and accompanying exhibitions, are interpreted using quantitative and qualitative methods. Characteristic-to-defining shifts from na??ve accounts to more autonomous aesthetic judgements of value are identified relative to the ontological stance children adopted in their critical reasoning about the portraits they chose. Findings include differences in the level of conceptual integration in justification of portraits chosen, differences in the breadth and autonomy of identity brought to bear in choices of portraits, but few differences in the representational abstraction of the images chosen by different age groups. The authenticity of the experimental tasks, as well as the rich characterisation of the developmental differences described in the study have significance for pedagogical explanations of critical practice in art education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On and off-axis monochromatic aberrations and myopia in young children</field><field name="creator">Martinez, Aldo A., Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: To study ???on??? and ???off-axis??? wavefront aberration of eyes of children and to determine the relationship with refractive error development.  Methods: On and off-axis ocular aberrations of cyclopleged eyes of children (mostly 12 year olds) were measured and compared to data obtained from a group of mostly 6 year old children. Only data from the right eyes were analysed (pupil diameter=5 mm) and categorised into refractive error groups based on ???M???. Differences in ???on??? and ???off-axis??? aberrations between refractive and ethnic groups were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses of variance with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Off-axis refraction was analysed using skiagrams and mean relative spherical equivalent.  Results: Data from 1,636 12 year old children (mean age 12.6 ?? 0.4 years) was analysed. Lower order aberrations were the largest and higher order aberrations contributed to only 25% of the wavefront. There were no differences in the amount of total higher orders between refractive groups. Of the individual higher orders, spherical aberration was greater in hyperopic eyes (0.07 ?? 0.06 ??m) in comparison to emmetropic and myopic eyes (0.05 ?? 0.04 ??m and 0.05 ?? 0.04 ??m) (p&lt;0.001). Myopic eyes had more positive values of Z(3,-1) (p&lt;0.05). Similar results were obtained for the 1,364 6 year old children (mean age 6.7 ??? 0.4 years). Despite East Asian children being more myopic than other ethnic groups (p&lt;0.01), there were no differences in higher orders except for low hyperopic East Asian eyes presenting with higher levels of positive spherical aberrations (p&lt;0.001). When compared to the fovea, off-axis myopic eyes had hyperopia (0.55 to 1.66 D) and emmetropes and hyperopes had myopia (0.10 to -2.00 D). Astigmatism and defocus were the dominant off-axis aberrations. The magnitude of higher order aberrations (mostly 3rd orders) increased with eccentricity but was similar across refractive error groups.  Conclusions: Myopic eyes do not have abnormal or excessive levels of on and off-axis higher order aberrations but had patterns of off-axis refraction that may be associated with progression. Considerable inter-subject variability in higher order aberrations was seen for all refractive groups. However, their magnitude was small and suggests that any impact on the optical quality of the eye is negligible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peripheral Refraction</field><field name="subject">Myopia</field><field name="subject">Monochromatic Aberrations</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Sydney Myopia Study</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy-driven framework for manageable and adaptive service-oriented processes</field><field name="creator">Erradi, Abdelkarim, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dynamic selection and composition of autonomous and loosely-coupled Web services is increasingly used to automate business processes. The typical long-running characteristic of business processes imposes new management challenges such as dynamic adaptation of running process instances. However, current process orchestration engines provide limited flexibility to dynamically adapt to changing runtime conditions (e.g., presence of faults). Additionally, current process specification languages exhibit some limitations regarding modularity of crosscutting management concerns. In particular, monitoring and adaptation logic is often scattered across several process definitions and intertwined with the business logic. This leads to monolithic and complex processes that are hard to understand, reuse, maintain, and evolve. To address these limitations, we developed a policy-based change management framework, named Manageable and Adaptable Service Compositions (MASC), to declaratively express crosscutting monitoring and process adaptation concerns in a separate and modular way. MASC policies use a set of simple, but flexible and relatively powerful, constructs to declaratively specify policies that govern: (1) discovery and selection of services to be used, (2) monitoring to detect the need for adaptation, (3) reconfiguration and adaptation of the process to handle special cases (e.g., context-dependant behaviour) and recover from typical faults in service-based processes. The identified constructs are executed by a lightweight service-oriented management middleware named MASC middleware. The adaptation is transparent because it preserves the original functional behaviour of the business process and does not tangle the adaptation logic with that of the business process. Additionally, policies do not have to be necessarily defined when designing the process; they can also be introduced later during deployment or at runtime. We implemented a MASC proof-of-concept prototype and evaluated it on Stock Trading case study scenarios. We conducted extensive studies to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed techniques and illustrate the benefits of our approach in providing adaptive composite services using the policy-based approach. Our performance and scalability studies indicate that MASC middleware is scalable and the introduced overhead are acceptable.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MASC Middleware</field><field name="subject">Manageable and Adaptive Web Services</field><field name="subject">Policy-Driven Framework for Web services management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery and adaptation of process views</field><field name="creator">Motahari Nezhad, Hamid Reza, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Business process analysis and integration are key endeavours for today's enterprises. Recently, Web services have been widely adopted for the implementation and integration of business processes within and across enterprises. In this dissertation, we investigate the problem of enabling the analysis of service interactions, in today's enterprises, in the context of business process executions, and that of service integration. Our study shows that only fraction of interactions in the enterprise are supported by process-aware systems. However, enabling above-mentioned analyses requires: (i)  a model of the underlying business process to be used as a reference for the analysis, and (ii) the ability to correlate events generated during service interactions into process instances. We refer to a process model and the corresponding process instances as a "process view". We propose the concept of process space to refer to all process related information sources in the enterprise, over which various process views are defined.  We propose the design and development of a system called "process space discovery system" (PSDS) for discovering process views in a process space. We introduce novel approaches for the correlation of events into process instances, focusing on the public processes of Web services (business protocols), and also for the discovery of the business protocol models from the process instances of a process view.  Analysis of service integration approaches shows that while standardisation in Web services simplifies the integration in the communication level, at the higher levels of abstractions (e.g., services interfaces and protocol models) services are still open to heterogeneities. We characterise the mismatches between service interfaces and protocol specifications and introduce "mismatch patterns" to represent them. A mismatch pattern also includes an adapter template that aims at the resolution of the captured mismatch. We also propose semi-automated approaches for identifying the mismatches between interface and protocol specifications of two services. The proposed approaches have been implemented in prototype tools, and experimentally validated on synthetic and real-world datasets. The discovered process views, using PSDS, can be used to perform various analyses in an enterprise, and the proposed adaptation approach facilitates the adoption of Web services in business process integration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web services integration.</field><field name="subject">Business processes.</field><field name="subject">Service oriented computing.</field><field name="subject">Business process discovery.</field><field name="subject">Web services adaptation.</field><field name="subject">Events correlations in business processes.</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises.</field><field name="subject">Correlation (Statistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutions and decentralised urban water management</field><field name="creator">Livingston, Daniel John, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Physically decentralised water management systems may contribute to improving the sustainability of urban water management. Any shift toward decentralised systems needs to consider not just physical system design but also social values, knowledge frames, and organisations, and their interconnections to the physical technology.  Four cases of recent Australian urban water management improvement projects were researched using qualitative methods. Three cases were of decentralised water management innovation. The other was of a centralised system, although decentralised options had been considered. These cases were studied to identify institutional barriers and enablers for the uptake of decentralised systems, and to better understand how emerging environmental engineering knowledge might be applied to overcome an implementation gap for decentralised urban water technologies.  Analysis of each case focused on the institutional elements of urban water management, namely: the values, knowledge frames and organisational structures. These elements were identified through in-depth interviews, document review, and an on-line survey. The alignment of these elements was identified as being a significant contributor to the stability of centralised systems, or to change toward decentralised systems.  A new organisational home for innovative knowledge was found to be common to each case where decentralised innovation occurred. ??Institutional entrepreneurs??, strong stakeholder engagement, and inter-organisational networks were all found to be linked to the creation of shared meaning and legitimacy for organisational and technological change.  Existing planning frameworks focus on expert justification for change rather than institutional support for change. Institutional factors include shared understandings, values and organisational frameworks, and the alignment of each factor. Principles for, and examples of, appropriate organisational design for enabling and managing decentralised technological innovation for urban water management are proposed.  This research contributes to the understanding of the institutional basis and dynamics of urban water management, particularly in relation to physical centralisation and decentralisation of urban water management technologies and, to a lesser extent, in relation to user involvement in urban water management. Understanding of factors that contribute to enabling and constraining decentralised technologies is extended to include institutional and organisational factors. New and practical pathways for change for the implementation of decentralised urban water systems are provided.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">institutions</field><field name="subject">urban water management</field><field name="subject">decentralised</field><field name="subject">sustainable water management</field><field name="subject">decentralisation</field><field name="subject">institionalisation</field><field name="subject">Water-supply -- Australia -- Management</field><field name="subject">Planning</field><field name="subject">Water quality management</field><field name="subject">Water resources development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some antecedents of Leibniz's principles</field><field name="creator">Castro, Martinho Antonio Bittencourt de, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Leibniz considered that scepticism and confusion engendered by the disputes of different sects or schools of metaphysics were obstacles to the progress of knowledge in philosophy. His solution was to adopt an eclectic method with the aim of uncovering the truth hidden beneath the dispute of schools. Leibniz's project was, having in mind the eclectic method, to synthesise a union between old pre-modern philosophy, based on formal and final causes, and new modern philosophy which gave preference to efficient causes. The result of his efforts is summarised in the Monadology. But the question remains: to what degree was Leibniz successful in this enterprise? An objective of this thesis is to investigate whether philosophical tradition can justify or support some of the arguments that are at the basis of Leibniz's system (for example, monads have no window to the exterior world, a phrase that summarises the structure of Monadology). I shall demonstrate how Leibniz reflects the concerns and the positions of his key predecessors. Thus, the aim of the thesis is to explore key antecedents to Leibniz's central doctrines. The thesis argues that Leibniz carried out a logical development of some principles in the eclectic system of Plotinus, which resulted in the structure of Monadology. Whether Leibniz's project was successful or not will depend on how we view those principles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monadology.</field><field name="subject">Leibniz.</field><field name="subject">History of philosophy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrazine in late transition metal-mediated N-C bond formation</field><field name="creator">Dabb, Serin Lloyd, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into the metal-mediated formation of nitrogen-carbon bonds from hydrazines and alkynes. Rh, Ir, Ru and Os metal complexes containing bidentate P,N- and N,N-donor ligands were all studied during the course of this work.  A series of stereoisomers of metal complexes of general formula MCl2(PyP)2 (where M = Ru and Os, PyP = 1-(2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl)pyrazole) (2.01-2.05) were synthesised. The isomerisation process of complexes 2.01-2.05 in solution was investigated. The ruthenium complex RuCl2(CO)(&#61547;1-P-PyP)(&#61547;2-P,N-PyP) (2.14), which contains one pendant PyP ligand bound through the P-donor ligand was synthesised, confirming the potential hemilability of the mixed P,N-donor ligand PyP.  Chloride abstraction from the ruthenium complex trans,cis,cis-RuCl2(PyP)2 (2.01) was achieved using either a sodium or silver salt to yield the dimeric complexes of general formula [Ru(&#956;-Cl)(PyP)2]2[X]2 (where M = Ru, X = OSO2CF3 (2.06), BF4 (2.07), BPh4 (2.08), and BArF 2.09). [Os(&#956;-Cl)(PyP)2]2[BPh4]2 (2.10) was synthesised from sodium tetraphenylborate and trans,cis,cis-OsCl2(PyP)2 (2.04).  The reactivity of dimeric complexes 2.06 and 2.08 towards substituted hydrazines was investigated. The methylhydrazine complex [Ru(PyP)2(NH2NHMe)][Cl][BPh4] (3.12) was synthesised. The methylhydrazine adduct of 3.12 binds to the metal centre in an end-on fashion via the NH2 group in solution, and in a bidentate fashion in the solid-state. This is the first reported example of a ruthenium complex containing a bidentate hydrazine ligand.  The ruthenium-vinylidene complexes [RuCl(Me2PyP)2(=C=C(H)Ph)]BPh4 (4.15) and [RuCl(Me2PyP)2(=C=C(H)n-Bu)]BPh4 (4.16) (Me2PyP = 1-(2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl)-3,5-dimethylpyrazole) were synthesised from trans,cis,cis-RuCl2(Me2PyP)2 (4.10) and the appropriate terminal alkyne. The reaction of alkynes with ruthenium complexes containing the PyP ligand was also investigated. Nitrogen-carbon bond formation was achieved through reaction of mono-substituted hydrazines with 4.06 and 4.07 to yield complexes of general formula [RuCl(&#61547;1-P-Me2PyP)(&#61547;2-P,N-Me2PyP)(&#61547;2-N,C-(NH2N(R2)C(CH2R1)]BPh4 (where R1 = R2 = Ph (4.19), R1= Ph, R2 = Me (4.20), R1 = n-Bu, R2 = Ph, (4.21) or R1 = n-Bu, R2 = Me (4.22)). The mechanism of the formation of the stable metallocyclic complexes 4.19-4.22 was elucidated through studies of the reactivity of 4.15 towards a series of amines and hydrazines and relies on the labile nature of the N-donor of the P,N-donor ligand Me2PyP. A method for the synthesis of triflate complexes of rhodium Rh(PyP)(CO)(OSO2CF3) (5.13) and Rh(PyPhP)(CO)(OSO2CF3) (PyPhP = 1-(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)pyrazole) (5.14) from rhodium chloride complexes was developed. The solid-state structure of rhodium triflate complex 5.14, which contained the more sterically rigid ligand PyPhP, exhibited a much greater distortion from the ideal square planar geometry than the rhodium analogue 5.13 which contains the PyP ligand. The triflate group of 5.13 and 5.14 was displaced by substituted hydrazines to yield new hydrazine complexes of rhodium. A series of Rh and Ir complexes with bidentate P,N- and N,N-donor ligands were found to catalyse the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes with hydrazines. [Ir(bpm)(CO)2]BArF (6.08) was found to be the most efficient catalyst of those studies for this transformation, and was amongst the most efficient catalysts reported to date for this transformation. The influence of counter-ion was highly significant in the catalysed intermolecular hydroamination reaction. The substrate scope of the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes with hydrazines was investigated using [Ir(bpm)(CO)2]BArF (6.08) as the catalyst.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrazine</field><field name="subject">Alkynes</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen -- Chemistry</field><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of a novel class of peptide mimics derived from N-acylisatins</field><field name="creator">Cheah, Wai Ching, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis was to synthesize a new class of peptide mimics derived from N-acylisatins and to investigate various methodologies for their synthesis.  N-Acetylisatin 15 and its derivatives 39 and 40 were found to undergo facile nucleophilic ring-opening with amino acid esters yielding a range of 2-acetamidophenylglyoxylamide derivatives in moderate to good yields. This type of reaction was also found to work for di- and tripeptide methyl ester hydrochlorides leading to a range of N-glyoxylamide peptide mimics. The methodology of the reaction conditions was further extended to N,N&#8242;-oxalyl bisisatins 17 and 134, and 1,3,5-tris(2,3-dioxoindoline-1-carbonyl)benzene 168 substrates and their reaction with amino acid esters gave a new range of C,C&#8242;-linked-bis-glyoxylamide peptide mimics and C,C&#8242;,C&#8242;&#8242;-linked tris-glyoxylamide peptide mimics respectively. Meanwhile, reactions of N-acylisatins with 1,10-diaminodecane 155 and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine 167 gave the corresponding bis and tris-glyoxylamides.  In the event of introducing amino acids at the N-1 position of isatin 9, a range of NH protecting groups for the synthesis of N-protected amino acid acyl isatins 193 were examined. It was found that the phthalamido group, e.g. phthaloylglycine 197, was the best protecting group for the introduction of a glycine unit at the N-1 position of isatin 9. Additionally, a viable and interesting alternative approach utilizing N-succinyl acylisatin 158 as the starting material was also demonstrated. In continuation of our interest in the peptidomimetic approach, a new class of cyclic peptide mimics using Grubbs?? ring-closing metathesis approach was also successfully synthesized. A range of bis-O-allyl substrates 237, 240, 242 and 246 were prepared from reaction of the corresponding N-acylisatins with L-valine allyl ester hydrochloride 236 and 1,10- diaminodecane 155 respectively.

The question investigated is whether such "early L2-dominant bilinguals" attain a native level of proficiency in their second language. This possibility was explored by comparing bilinguals who had Cantonese L1 (logographic, morphosyllabic), Vietnamese L1 (alphabetic, morphosyllabic) or some "Other" L1 (alphabetic, non-morphosyllabic) to English monolinguals on various tasks in English (L2). The ability to process spoken stimuli was examined using phoneme deletion, spelling-to-dictation, and auditory comprehension tasks. The results showed that bilinguals from all backgrounds had greater difficulty than monolinguals on tasks that required sublexical skills, with the morphosyllabic groups performing the most poorly. The processing of print was investigated using reading aloud and reading comprehension tasks. In contrast to the auditory tasks, only Cantonese L1 bilinguals displayed any discernable difference from monolinguals on reading. Cantonese L1 bilinguals did, however, outperform monolinguals on orthographic memory tasks, such as the spelling of idiosyncratic L2 words. The findings therefore indicated that L1 linguistic structure influences L2 processing in adulthood, despite the former having become subordinate. In order to elucidate whether transfer effects arise solely from early exposure to L1, or whether L1 maintenance also plays a role, the L1 and L2 proficiency of a separate sample of Cantonese L1 bilinguals was examined. However, no meaningful relationship between L1 and L2 proficiency was found. Finally, a sample of late bilinguals were also tested in order to determine whether the L1-specific effects observed in early bilinguals are simply an attenuated version of those in late bilinguals,. The results revealed that the development of language dominance in L2 does lead to qualitatively different outcomes in L2 for early bilinguals. The findings from the present research are most consistent with the Competition Model (e.g., Hernandez, Li, &amp; MacWhinney, 2005), which espouses the notions of L1 transfer and entrenchment to explain second language acquisition. Overall, the research indicates that native attainment in L2 is not assured for all early L2-dominant bilinguals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early L2-dominant bilinguals</field><field name="subject">Second language processing</field><field name="subject">Language dominance</field><field name="subject">L1 transfer effects</field><field name="subject">Morphosyllabicity</field><field name="subject">Bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Adult</field><field name="subject">Psycholinguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology mapping: a logic-based approach with applications in selected domains</field><field name="creator">Wong, Alfred Ka Yiu, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In advent of the Semantic Web and recent standardization efforts, Ontology has quickly become a popular and core semantic technology. Ontology is seen as a solution provider to knowledge based systems. It facilitates tasks such as knowledge sharing, reuse and intelligent processing by computer agents. A key problem addressed by Ontology is the semantic interoperability problem. Interoperability in general is a common problem in different domain applications and semantic interoperability is the hardest and an ongoing research problem. It is required for systems to exchange knowledge and having the meaning of the knowledge accurately and automatically interpreted by the receiving systems. The innovation is to allow knowledge to be consumed and used accurately in a way that is not foreseen by the original creator. While Ontology promotes semantic interoperability across systems by unifying their knowledge bases through consensual understanding, common engineering and processing practices, it does not solve the semantic interoperability problem at the global level. As individuals are increasingly empowered with tools, ontologies will eventually be created more easily and rapidly at a near individual scale. Global semantic interoperability between heterogeneous ontologies created by small groups of individuals will then be required.	Ontology mapping is a mechanism for providing semantic bridges between ontologies. While ontology mapping promotes semantic interoperability across ontologies, it is seen as the solution provider to the global semantic interoperability problem. However, there is no single ontology mapping solution that caters for all problem scenarios. Different applications would require different mapping techniques.	In this thesis, we analyze the relations between ontology, semantic interoperability and ontology mapping, and promote an ontology-based semantic interoperability solution. We propose a novel ontology mapping approach namely, OntoMogic. It is based on first order logic and model theory. OntoMogic supports approximate mapping and produces structures (approximate entity correspondence) that represent alignment results between concepts. OntoMogic has been implemented as a coherent system and is applied in different application scenarios. We present case studies in the network configuration, security intrusion detection and IT governance &amp; compliance management domain. The full process of ontology engineering to mapping has been demonstrated to promote ontology-based semantic interoperability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic interoperability</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">ontology mapping</field><field name="subject">compliance management</field><field name="subject">network management</field><field name="subject">network security intrusion detection</field><field name="subject">network configuration management</field><field name="subject">integrated network management</field><field name="subject">Mappings (Mathematics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tetrahydrofolate and iron-sulfur metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="creator">Gelling, Cristy Lee, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tetrahydrofolate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is required for the biosynthesis of many central metabolites, including some amino acids, nucleobases, and nucleotides, and hence dysfunction of one-carbon metabolism is associated with many human diseases and disorders.  The mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) is an important component of one-carbon metabolism, generating 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-H??4folate) from glycine.  Previous work has shown that the genes encoding the unique sub-units of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GDC (GCV1, GCV2 and GCV3) are regulated in response to changes in the levels of cytosolic 5,10-CH2-H??4folate (Piper et al., 2000).  Given the centrality of 5,10-CH2-H??4folate to many aspects of metabolism, it was hypothesised that other genes may be regulated by the same mechanism. Using microarray analysis of S. cerevisiae under a number of conditions that affect 5,10-CH2-H??4folate levels, the ??one-carbon regulon??, a group of genes that were co-regulated with the GCV genes was identified.  The one-carbon regulon corresponds closely to genes whose promoters are bound by the purine biosynthesis regulator Bas1p, but not all one-carbon regulon members are significantly purine regulated.  Genetic approaches demonstrated that the one-carbon unit response and the purine response are distinct, though both depend on the presence of Bas1p.   This demonstrated that the close metabolic connections of one-carbon and purine metabolism are reflected in over-lapping, but separable regulatory mechanisms. The identity of the sensor of one-carbon unit depletion remains unknown, but in the course of investigation of the candidate regulator Caf17p, it was demonstrated that Caf17p is in fact involved in Fe/S cluster protein maturation.  Examination of the effects of Caf17p depletion revealed that Caf17p is required for the function and maturation of the related mitochondrial Fe/S proteins aconitase and homoaconitase, as well as the function of, but not de novo iron incorporation into, the mitochondrial radical-SAM Fe/S protein biotin synthase.  Because other Fe/S proteins were unaffected, Caf17p appears to be a specialised Fe/S maturation factor.  The presence of a putative H4folate binding site indicates that Caf17p may constitute a metabolic link between one-carbon and iron metabolism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase</field><field name="subject">Iron sulphur proteins</field><field name="subject">Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the cutting performance in multipass abrasive waterjet machining of alumina ceramics with controlled nozzle oscillation</field><field name="creator">Zhong, Yu, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation has been undertaken to study the depth of cut in multipass abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting of an 87% alumina ceramic with controlled nozzle oscillation. The experimental data have been statistically analysed to study the trends of the depth of cut with respect to the process parameters. It has been found that multipass cutting with controlled nozzle oscillation can significantly increase the depth of cut. Within the same cutting time and using the same cutting parameters other than the jet traverse speed, it has been found that multipass cutting with nozzle oscillation can increase the depth of cut by an average of 74.6% as compared to single pass cutting without nozzle oscillation. Furthermore, a multipass cutting with higher nozzle traverse speeds can achieve a larger depth of cut than a single pass cutting at a low traverse speed within the same cutting time. A recommendation has been made for the selection of appropriate process parameters for multipass cutting with nozzle oscillation. In order to estimate the depth of cut on a mathematical basis, predictive models for the depth of cut in multipass cutting with and without nozzle oscillation have been developed using a dimensional analysis technique. The model development starts with the models for single pass cutting which are then extended to multipass cutting where considerations are given to the change of the actual standoff distance after each pass and the variation of kerf width. These predictive models has been numerically studied for their plausibility by assessing their predicted trends with respect to the various process variables, and verified qualitatively and quantitatively based on the experimental data. The model assessment reveals that the developed models correlate very well with the experimental results and can give adequate predictions of this cutting performance measure in process planning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multipass operation</field><field name="subject">Abrasive waterjet cutting</field><field name="subject">Controlled nozzle oscillation</field><field name="subject">Depth of cut</field><field name="subject">Dimensional analysis</field><field name="subject">Predictive mathematical model</field><field name="subject">Abrasives</field><field name="subject">Water jet cutting</field><field name="subject">Ceramics</field><field name="subject">Nozzles</field><field name="subject">Oscillations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Edwin Philip Enfield, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Congenital heart disease is the most common form of birth defect, affecting approximately 1% of liveborn babies. Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is the second most common form of congenital heart disease (CHD). Most cases have no known cause. Chromosomal, syndromal and teratogenic causes account for a minority of cases. The hypothesis that mutations in the ASD genes NKX2-5 and GATA4 may cause apparently sporadic ASD was tested by sequencing them in unrelated probands with ASD. In this study, 1/102 individuals with ASD had an NKX2-5 mutation, and 1/129 had a deletion of the GATA4 gene.  The cardiac transcription factor TBX20 interacts with other ASD genes but had not previously been associated with human disease. Of 352 individuals with CHD, including 175 with ASD, 2 individuals, each with a family history of CHD, had pathogenic mutations in TBX20. Phenotypes included ASD, VSD, valvular abnormalities and dilated cardiomyopathy.  These studies of NKX2-5, GATA4 and TBX20 indicate that dominant ASD genes account for a small minority of cases of ASD, and emphasize the considerable genetic heterogeneity in dominant ASD (also caused by mutations in MYH6 and ACTC). A new syndrome of dominant ASD and the Marcus Gunn jaw winking phenomenon is reported. Linkage to known loci was excluded, extending this heterogeneity, but a whole genome scan did not identify a candidate locus for this disorder.  Previous studies of inbred laboratory mice showed an association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and measures of atrial septal morphology, particularly septum primum length (???flap valve length??? or FVL). In humans, PFO is associated with cryptogenic stroke and migraine, and is regarded as being in a pathological contiuum with ASD. Twelve inbred strains, including 129T2/SvEms and QSi5, were studied, with generation of [129T2/SvEms x QSi5] F1, F2 and F14 mice. Studies of atrial morphology in 3017 mice confirmed the relationship between FVL and PFO but revealed considerable complexity. An F2 mapping study identified 7 significant and 6 suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTL), affecting FVL and two other traits, foramen ovale width (FOW) and crescent width (CRW). Binary analysis of PFO supported four of these.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mapping.</field><field name="subject">Heart.</field><field name="subject">Genetics.</field><field name="subject">QTL.</field><field name="subject">Atrial septal defects.</field><field name="subject">Congenital heart disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/34759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in stem cell biology and developmental pathway regulation in the pancreas and breast</field><field name="creator">O'Toole, Sandra Alison, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Breast and pancreatic cancers are among the major causes of cancer mortality in our society. There has been a significant decline in mortality from breast cancer over the last two decades, while pancreatic cancer has an exceptionally poor prognosis. Although these malignancies have very different clinical outcomes they share the common feature that metastatic disease is almost uniformly fatal. The existence of cancer stem cells has been postulated as a major factor in tumour recurrence after traditional chemo- or radio-therapy. Addressing this important clinical question requires a deeper understanding of the biology of normal and cancer stem cells and the signalling pathways involved in their regulation. The identity of the pancreatic stem cell remains elusive. However, using a murine model of haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation I have demonstrated for the first time transdifferentiation of these bone marrow derived cells into mature pancreatic acinar cells, where they appear to contribute to cell turnover ultimately forming acini and lobules. These data show that HSC have surprising developmental plasticity and provide insight into a potential stem cell niche in the pancreas. The Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch signalling pathways play a critical role in early development and in the maintenance and self-renewal of stem cells. There is also increasing evidence that dysregulation of these pathways contributes to the development of many malignancies. There is relatively little information regarding their role in breast cancer development and progression. I used immunohistochemistry for key proteins in these pathways, sonic hedgehog, beta-catenin and Notch 1 in three substantial series of human breast lesions and determined that abnormal expression of these proteins is an early event in the development in breast cancer, and is associated with particular breast cancer subtypes, Shh and beta-catenin expression is associated predominantly with the basal-like phenotype and Notch 1 with the HER2 amplified phenotype. Overexpression of Shh in particular confers a worse clinical outcome in invasive ductal carcinoma. Furthermore, increased levels of Shh in a 3D culture model of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells resulted in disorganisation of acini and the development of an abnormal discohesive phenotype. Finally the role of Shh was investigated in a mammary epithelial transplantation model, where overexpression of Shh resulted in the development of hyperplasia of the mammary ductal epithelium.  Together these data confirm that the Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch developmental pathways are dysregulated in breast cancer and represent viable targets for further investigation of potential novel therapies in breast cancer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wnt</field><field name="subject">Hedgehog</field><field name="subject">Notch</field><field name="subject">Breast</field><field name="subject">stem cell</field><field name="subject">pancreas</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of idealised image features in determining post-exposure body image and social comparisons</field><field name="creator">Aldridge, Fiona Jane, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research examined the role that idealised image characteristics have in determining post-exposure body image and amount of self-reported social comparisons. This was tested by exposing female undergraduate students to media-portrayed idealised images that varied in their level of relevance, salience, or attainability. A negative impact of these images was indicated by greater post-exposure body dissatisfaction and body size estimation inaccuracy. In contrast, a positive impact was considered to have occurred when body dissatisfaction decreased and body size estimation was more accurate. If the images had a neutral impact on body image, one would expect little difference between groups or over time. A further aim was to determine whether a higher level of trait tendency to compare was related to more negative responding at post-exposure. In addition, thin ideal internalisation and restraint were examined as possible moderators. Studies 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 indicated that idealised image relevance and salience had little differential impact on post-exposure body image. That is, exposure to thin idealised images, irrespective of the salience and relevance manipulations, resulted in similar post-exposure body dissatisfaction and body size estimation. In contrast to this, the attainability of the image seemed to influence post-exposure responding, at least in terms of body size estimation (Study 4). Higher trait tendency to compare was associated with a greater amount of self-reported comparison with the images, but had little impact on body image. Surprisingly, these results were not moderated by thin ideal internalisation or restraint. The role of individual differences was explored with additional analyses in Study 5, which revealed that, when the power is sufficient, thin ideal internalisation, restraint, and self-reported comparisons with the images predicted post-exposure body dissatisfaction, but not body size estimation. Overall, this program of research suggests that idealised image features do not play a vital differential role in determining post-exposure body image, unless it is the body itself that is being manipulated. Results from this research support the idea that the mere presence of an idealised body is sufficient to activate negative responses, and there was little, if any, evidence for the occurrence of positive responses. These findings are discussed in terms of social comparison and schema theory, and in terms of their practical implications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media portrayed idealised images</field><field name="subject">body image</field><field name="subject">social comparison theory</field><field name="subject">Social comparison</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of composite cavity fibre lasers for fibre laser hydrophone systems</field><field name="creator">Leung, Ian Kin-Hay, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, my main focus was to establish a novel composite-cavity fibre laser (CCFL) and to apply it in sensing, particularly in the hydrophone application. The CCFL that I have proposed is formed by writing three wavelength matched fibre Bragg gratings directly into a continuous length of doped fibre. I have also examined the relative advantages and disadvantages of interferometric and intensity-based hydrophone systems, and have established a hydrophone system that can be switched between the two modes of operation, by making use of digital signal processing. I have established a theoretical model to study the lasing and spectral characteristics of the CCFL. My analysis showed that whilst the CCFL have significantly different phase and threshold conditions from the common semiconductor diode lasers with external cavity, the CCFL also have mode-limiting properties that are often sought after. Through simulations, I was able to identify that a non-uniform straining scheme, that is, when one of the sub-cavities of the CCFL is restrained from strain, can improve the sensitivity with respect to existing single cavity fibre lasers, in both the frequency and intensity domains. My simulations also showed that the sensitivity of such a straining scheme can be optimised by tuning the reflectivity of the gratings, sub-cavity lengths, doping concentration and pump power. I have fabricated multiple CCFLs using the in-house grating writing facilities, and have experimentally assessed their power and spectral related lasing characteristics. Whilst having a significantly longer total cavity length compared to typical fibre lasers, the CCFLs demonstrated stable single longitudinal mode operation and narrow linewidth in the order for a few tens of kHz. Asymmetric output power and frequency as a result of unequal sub-cavity lengths were also examined. Finally, I conducted sensing experiments by applying the CCFLs in strain monitoring and intensity-based hydrophone. My results showed that the non-uniform straining scheme had significantly improved the intensity response of the CCFL, and that the acoustic pressure and frequency can be determined by directly sampling and applying Fourier transform to the output intensity of the fibre laser.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fibre Hydrophone</field><field name="subject">Fibre Laser</field><field name="subject">Fibre Optic Sensing</field><field name="subject">Laser communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In sickness and in health: identity-based and relational discourses of intimacy in the early 21st century</field><field name="creator">Borinski, Diana , Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">What ways of being and knowing constitute the experience of healthy relational life? Ontologically, what takes place in the experience of meeting a loved one, face to face? What is ???good communication??? in an intimate relationship? What does commitment enable in relational life, and what constitutes healthy dedication in marriages?  This thesis addresses the above questions through a conceptual analysis of the dual nature of social life: identity-based, self-reifying, object-focused, atomised and oppositional, and dialogical, relational and present. It does so with the help of qualitatively analysed interviews of respondents talking about their experiences of committed intimate relationships.  The first part of this thesis discovers that current social theory links the increased fragility of intimate relationships to the individualisation of social experience, and the rise of discourses that encourage reflexivity and personal responsibility. I discuss specific funding strategies the Australian Federal Government employs in seeking to manage the risk of marriage breakdown in the community. I argue that while a complex mix of rational-instrumental reasoning, the neo-liberal ethos of self-enterprise and some Christian norms of family life underlie much policy, the actual practice of marriage education in Australia has a community basis, and has much potential for real relationships. I offer a critique of risk-preventative discourses in marriage pedagogy, and show that the key terms used by clinical researchers draw on the same methodological individualism as the economic model of relational life. I argue that often, social theorists also reduce relationships to dyads of competing individuals exchanging themselves as goods, or bargaining for the best deal while using their investments as threat points. I suggest that the identity struggles that ensue from such alienated relations in intimate lives can be understood through the Hegelian binary oppositional model, and also, through some psychoanalytical theory on differentiation.  This thesis suggests that on examination of couples??? relationships, we find a different ontological structure in relationality. Relationships have the potential to transcend their total, additive, atomised form and be experienced as wholes. Couples teach us that love is not just self-directed action; that choice can burden, but responsibility to what is present can be freeing; and that relational ???success??? is more complex than simply staying together for life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family.</field><field name="subject">Marriage.</field><field name="subject">Couples.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/34945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transient viral infection of plant tissue culture and plants for production of virus and foreign protein</field><field name="creator">Shih, Sharon Min-Hsuan , Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work was aimed to investigate the basic viral infection protocols mainly focusing on Nicotiana benthamiana hairy root cultures and wild-type tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The application of transgenic virus containing the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) for foreign protein production in plant tissue cultures and whole plants was also studied. The effect on viral accumulation of the form of plant tissue culture used, such as hairy roots, shooty teratomas and suspended cells, was investigated. Viral infection was shown to have no effect on culture growth and morphology. Hairy root cultures are a superior host for viral propagation and production in vitro. The maximum specific rate of viral accumulation occurred mainly during the root growth phase. The average maximum virus concentration in the hairy roots was 0.82 ?? 0.14 mg g-1 dry weight and virus protein represented a maximum of approximately 6% of total soluble protein in the root biomass. Proportional scale-up of TMVinfected hairy roots in shake flasks and bioreactors can be achieved without changing the average virus concentration accumulated in the hairy roots. The level of viral accumulation was much lower in N. benthamiana hairy roots infected with transgenic virus containing GFP (TMVGFPC3) compared with TMV and low levels or no GFP was detected. Viral accumulation and GFP production in whole plants was studied using different generations of transgenic TMV-GFPC3 virus. Hybrid viruses with the foreign gene GFPC3 deleted may have been formed in successive TMV-GFPC3 generations, resulting in the loss of GFP production and enhanced viral infectivity. In vitro generated RNA transcript and first generation TMV-GFPC3 were found to be more suitable for infection than the second generation TMV-GFPC3. However, the accumulation of GFP and virus concentration did not occur at the same ratio. Provided a more genetically stable transgenic viral vector is used for infection, transient viral infection of hairy roots can be a potential alternative system for foreign protein production than plants grown in the field as the containment or safety issues can be addressed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Viral production.</field><field name="subject">Plant tissue culture.</field><field name="subject">Transient viral infection.</field><field name="subject">Foreign protein production.</field><field name="subject">Virus diseases of plants.</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Synthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/34967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resistance and cultural revitalisation: reading Blackfoot agency in the texts of cultural transformation 1870&#150;1920</field><field name="creator">Tov??as de Plaisted, Blanca, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The radical transformations attendant upon the imposition of colonial rule on the Siksikaitsitapi or Blackfoot of northern Alberta and southern Montana are examined in this dissertation in order to emphasise the threads of continuity within a tapestry of cultural change c.1870-1920. The dissertation traces cultural persistence through the analysis of texts of history and literature that constructed Blackfoot subjectivity in the half-century following the end of traditional lifeways and settlement on three reserves in Canada and one reservation in the United States of America.  This interdisciplinary thesis has been undertaken jointly in the School of History and Philosophy, and the School of English, Media and Performance Studies. It combines the tools of historical research and literary criticism to analyse the discourses and counter-discourses that served to construct Blackfoot subjectivity in colonial texts. It engages with the ways in which the Blackfoot navigated colonisation and resisted forced acculturation while adopting strategies of accommodation to ensure social reproduction and even physical survival in this period. To this end, it presents four case studies, each focusing on a discrete process of Blackfoot cultural transformation: a) the resistance to acculturation and cultural revitalisation as it relates to the practice of Ookaan (Sun Dance); b) the power shifts ushered in by European contact and the intersection between power and Blackfoot dress practices; c) the participation of Blackfoot "organic intellectuals" in the construction of Blackfoot history through the transformation of oral stories into text via the ethnographic encounter; and d) the continuing links between Blackfoot history and literature, and contemporary fictional representations of Blackfoot subjectivity by First Nations authors. This thesis acknowledges that Blackfoot history and literature have been constructed through a complex matrix of textual representations from their earliest contacts with Europeans. This dissertation is a study of the intersection between textual representations of the Blackfoot, and resistance, persistence and cultural revitalisation 1870-1920. It seeks to contribute to debates on the capacity of the colonised Other to exercise agency. It engages with views articulated by organic intellectuals, and Blackfoot and other First Nations scholars, in order to foster a dialogue between Blackfoot and non-Blackfoot scholarship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Siksika Indians.</field><field name="subject">Indians of North America -- Foreign influences.</field><field name="subject">Indians of North America -- Cultural assimilation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language of love in culture of silence: Iranian women???s sexual understandings and sociocultural context</field><field name="creator">Merghati Khoei, Effat, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sexuality is a culturally embedded phenomenon that needs in-depth exploration. Quantifying people???s sexuality without examining it through their own eyes is not enough to allow us to address sexual health goals. This qualitative study explored the development of the sexual understandings of Iranian women who migrated to Australia after the age of 16. The study used women???s life history and sexual stories as the foundation for understanding their experiences, perceptions and beliefs with the aim of contributing to the literature on women???s health, sexual health and sexual development. Data for this study was collected from 2003 to early 2005 using a multi-method design incorporating informal ethnographic encounters, five focus group discussions with 33 women aged 19 to 82, and 22 in-depth individual interviews. Thematic and narrative analyses explored the information elicited. The findings showed considerable individual variation in women???s life experiences. Nonetheless, all sought reproductive sexuality within heterosexual marriage. The language women used to express sexuality shaped their sexual understandings and expression of sexuality. Childhood experiences were shown to be important to the development of gender identity and awareness of sexuality, and revealed the family management of sexuality during childhood. Puberty and its intensive social management contributed to women???s overall understandings of gender role, sex role and sexual self-image as ???a precious sexual being???. Finally, sexual selfhood was transformed through the institution of marriage, leading to the acquisition of sexual subjectivity understood in sometimes conflicting terms as a ???proper wife??? and/or a ???sexually successful woman???. Sexuality in later life and the impact of attitudes to menopause on women???s sense of self, especially sexual self-negation, were also explored. The study revealed the inadequacy of a cultural influence model of sexuality built on an essentialist biological base, showing that even women???s ability to experience sexual sensation was culturally constructed. On the foundation of androcentricity, women???s sexuality is regulated and silenced at both the individual and social levels. Finally, some suggestions are made for sexual health care in multicultural settings like Australia and for social change to address the empowerment and sexual agency of women.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antiviral shRNA (for HIV-1)</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Glen J, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human Immunodeficiency Virus type I (HIV-1) is an RNA virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Gene therapy is a new treatment paradigm that aims to modify the patient???s cells with therapeutic agents to reduce viral replication and disease progression. A recently discovered technology with potential application in gene therapy for HIV-1 is the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway; a natural gene suppression mechanism where a 19 ??? 21 bp dsRNA trigger prevents the translation of complementary target RNAs. The RNAi pathway can be harnessed artificially with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs or hairpins); expressed RNA transcripts that fold into ???hairpin??? configurations by virtue of selfcomplementary regions separated by a short ???loop??? sequence. The aim of this project was to use pre-clinical models to investigate shRNA design, construction, screening and coexpression for potential use as an anti-HIV-1 therapeutic agent. A PC2-rated assay using multiple fluorescent reporters was developed to screen shRNAs for anti-HIV-1 suppressive activity, simultaneously measuring, and distinguishing, between target-specific and nonspecific shRNA activities. Phi29 DNA polymerase was used to modify the primer extension method for constructing shRNA vectors, increasing its efficiency whilst maintaining its cost effectiveness. A novel sequencing procedure using a restriction enzyme loop sequence was developed, which allowed the sequence of all shRNA vectors to be confirmed at highthroughput automated sequencing facilities. A comprehensive study of hairpin design factors showed that whilst shRNA stem length could affect processing and activity, sequence composition was the critical determinant of suppressive activity. Using the screening and construction methods developed here, many hairpins were designed and tested with at least one highly active hairpin found for each HIV-1 gene. Pre-existing and novel shRNA co-expression strategies were successfully used to co-express up to 4 hairpins to theoretically counter the emergence of viral escape mutants. Overall, this work has shown that expressed shRNAs are potentially suitable to treat HIV-1, since highly active shRNAs can be designed against all HIV-1 genes, shRNA vectors can be efficiently constructed, shRNA activities can be effectively screened and shRNAs can be combined to suppress simultaneously multiple targets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Once daily gentamicin in infants and children: an evaluation of safety and the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in minimising toxicity</field><field name="creator">Best, Emma, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">AIMS: To assess (i) the safety of once daily dosing (ODD) of gentamicin by systematic evaluation of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity; and (ii) the usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in a paediatric cohort. METHOD: Infants and children with suspected or proven gram negative sepsis were enrolled prospectively to receive ODD gentamicin at 7 mg/kg/day. Neonates were excluded. Hearing and renal function were assessed at baseline, during and after therapy by otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and by either serum creatinine or glomerular filtration rate. Abnormal OAE were followed with audiometry. TDM was performed using an interval adjusted graphical method (Hartford nomogram) with levels taken between 6-14 hours after dose. Assessment of efficacy (clinical and microbiological) was a secondary outcome measure. RESULTS: There were 106 episodes of therapy in 79 children (median age 5.6 years; range 1 month - 16 years), 60% of which were for febrile neutropaenia. Evaluation was complete in 88% (93/106) for ototoxicity and 92% (98/106) for nephrotoxicity. Two children (1.88%, 95% CI 0.10 - 7.13) experienced permanent hearing loss. Three children did not complete full assessment after preliminary abnormalities on OAE. Incorporating these cases gives a ???worst case scenario??? incidence of 4.71% (95% CI 1.71 - 10.91) possible ototoxicity. One child (0.94%, 95% CI &lt; 0.10 - 5.73) experienced transient nephrotoxicity. No ???toxic??? serum gentamicin levels were detected, including in those children who experienced clinical toxicity. All children with detectable toxicity were undergoing treatment for malignancies and had received nephro or ototoxic medications prior to the gentamicin course. Complete or partial efficacy was seen in 93% (non oncology) and 78% (oncology) treatment episodes, equivalent to prior literature reports. CONCLUSION: In this systematically evaluated paediatric cohort receiving ODD gentamicin, toxicity occurred infrequently and only in those with identifiable risk factors. TDM did not identify children who developed clinical toxicity. The development of toxicity appears to be associated with factors such as underlying medical condition, prior courses of gentamicin, exposure to other oto or nephrotoxic medications, all of which may be more predictive of toxicity than elevated serum gentamicin levels. TDM in healthy children on short course gentamicin appears unnecessary, but may be warranted in conjunction with renal and hearing assessments in those with risk factors.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gentamicin.</field><field name="subject">Infants.</field><field name="subject">Children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lost in the archive: vision, artefact and loss in the evolution of hypertext</field><field name="creator">Barnet, Belinda, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">How does one write the history of a technical machine? Can we say that technical machines have their own genealogies, their own evolutionary dynamic? The technical artefact constitutes a series of objects, a lineage or a line. At a cursory level, we can see this in the fact that technical machines come in generations - they adapt and adopt characteristics over time, one suppressing the other as it becomes obsolete. It is argued that technics has its own evolutionary dynamic, and that this dynamic stems neither from biology nor from human societies. Yet 'it is impossible to deny the role of human thought in the creation of technical artefacts' (Guattari 1995, p. 37). Stones do not automatically rise up into a wall - humans 'invent' technical objects. This, then, raises the question of technical memory. Is it humans that remember previous generations of machines and transfer their characteristics to new machines? If so, how and where do they remember them? It is suggested that humans learn techniques from technical artefacts, and transfer these between machines. This theory of technical evolution is then used to understand the genealogy of hypertext. The historical differentiations of hypertext in different technical systems is traced. Hypertext is defined as both a technical artefact and also a set of techniques: both are a part of this third milieu, technics. The difference between technical artefact and technical vision is highlighted, and it is suggested that technique and vision change when they are externalised as material artefact. The primary technique traced is association, the organisational principle behind the hypertext systems explored in the manuscript. In conclusion, invention is shown to be an act of exhumation, the transfer and retroactiviation of techniques from the past. This thesis presents an argument for a new model of technical evolution, a model which claims that technics constitutes its own dynamic, and that this dynamic exceeds human evolution. It traces the genealogy of hypertext as a set of techniques and as series of material artefacts.

Several studies have identified RNAi suppressors encoded by animal viruses, suggesting an antiviral role for the RNAi pathway in animals as well as plants (Andersson et al., 2005, Bennasser et al., 2006, Garcia et al., 2006, Li et al., 2004, Lichner et al., 2003, Lingel et al., 2005, Lu &amp; Cullen, 2004, Wang et al., 2006). However, most of these studies were performed in non-mammalian systems and as yet, there is no direct evidence indicating that the RNAi pathway plays a significant antiviral role during the infection of mammalian cells. Interestingly, several viruses have now been shown to express their own microRNA (miRNA) in infected cells (Grey et al., 2005, Pfeffer et al., 2005, Pfeffer et al., 2004, Samols et al., 2005, Sullivan et al., 2005). Further, in the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV), there is evidence that the virus usurps the host cell miRNAs to enhance viral replication (Jopling et al., 2005). The principal aim of this project was to investigate the role of RNAi in mammalian cells during viral infection, particularly infection with the influenza A virus.  This thesis is divided into six major chapters followed by a brief general discussion. Chapter 1 contains a general introduction to the RNAi pathway. It describes the history of the discovery of RNAi and summarizes the known and proposed antiviral roles of the RNAi pathway in plants and mammalian cells. Chapter 2 describes the general materials and methods used for this project.  There are four main result chapters, each dealing with a specific experimental system. Each chapter is divided into a brief introduction, specific materials and methods used, followed by presentation of the experimental results and a brief discussion.  Chapter 3 describes the development of an in vitro Dicer activity assay to study the effect of viral proteins on the activity of the mammalian Dicer protein. It was demonstrated that crude cell lysates derived from influenza A virus infected cells impaired the activity of Dicer and this observation was not due to degradation of the Dicer protein by virally-induced proteases.  Chapter 4 describes the use of a GFP reporter assay for screening potential RNAi suppressors. This assay is suitable for studying viral proteins in isolation. The effect of the influenza NS1 protein on the RNAi pathway in HEK293 cells was investigated and it was shown that NS1 could exert modest, but nevertheless significant, suppression of the RNAi pathway. Northern studies, performed to examine the processing of shRNA in the presence of NS1, demonstrated that NSI suppressed the RNAi mechanism through interfering with the maturation ofshRNA into siRNA.  Chapter 5 describes the effect of over-expressing components of the RNAi pathway on influenza A virus infection. In these experiments, Exportin 5, which encodes a protein involved in the transport of pre-miRNA/shRNA into the cytoplasm, was over-expressed during influenza A virus infection. Reduced viral infection was observed in cells over-expressing Exportin 5, suggesting that this treatment protects cells from virus infection.  Chapter 6 describes the expressed small RNA profile during influenza A virus infection in MDCK cells. Novel canine miRNA homologues were identified through cloning and sequencing. No definitive evidence for virally-derived siRNA/miRNA was found but a general reduction of endogenous miRNA expression was detected.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RNAi pathway.</field><field name="subject">RNA.</field><field name="subject">NS1.</field><field name="subject">Virus.</field><field name="subject">Mammalian cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">B-SCP: an integrated approach for validating alignment of organizational IT requirements with competitive business strategy</field><field name="creator">Bleistein, Steven J, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Strategic alignment of IT exists when a business organization???s goals and processes are in harmony with the IT software and systems that support them. Evidence shows that effective strategic alignment leads to superior financial performance of companies. Hence, CIOs and IT executives consistently rank alignment of IT with business strategy as a top priority in numerous surveys. Despite its importance to industry, strategic alignment has largely been ignored by requirements engineering research. The objective of the research presented in this thesis is to develop and test B-SCP, a requirements engineering analytical framework to help ensure that system requirements of organizational IT are in alignment with and provide support for competitive business strategy. B-SCP combines requirements engineering methods for formalizing and reasoning about software with analytical frameworks for competitive business strategy. Goal modeling, problem diagrams, and business process modeling, techniques typically used in isolation in requirements engineering, are integrated in a coherent framework. VMOST analysis, a management tool for organizational alignment, is used to elicit business strategy from executives. The Business Rules Group???s Model for Organizational Motivation is used to provide guidance for constructing a goal model to represent business strategy. A business modeling framework proposed in management research on e-business systems, is used to define the boundaries of scope for the organizational IT requirements problem. B-SCP is evaluated and validated by two worked examples using data on completed, strategic IT projects of significant scale and complexity, occurring in different industrial application domains. The second worked example includes evaluation based on expert feedback from a major, IT executive stakeholder in the original project. This research concludes that B-SCP provides a credible solution to the industrial problem of validating organizational IT requirements against business strategy. This thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of requirements engineering research, in which issues of business strategy and strategic alignment have gone unaddressed. In addition, this thesis presents a potentially practical, real-world solution to the major, ongoing challenge of business- IT strategic alignment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of antibacterial contact lenses on inflammatory responses in a guinea pig model</field><field name="creator">Vijay, Ajay Kumar, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contact Lens Acute Red Eye (CLARE) and Infiltrative Keratitis (IK) are inflammatory responses of the eye associated with extended wear of soft contact lenses. Bacterial colonization of contact lenses with Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important risk factor for the development of these adverse responses. Strategies that control the bacterial colonization of contact lenses may help prevent the occurrence of adverse responses. This thesis aimed to develop an animal model of CLARE/IK to test this hypothesis and to test the effectiveness of contact lenses containing antimicrobial compounds, namely silver and furanone compounds, in controlling corneal inflammation caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  A guinea pig model of contact lens wear was developed for the study and it was observed that the ocular responses to contact lens wear in the guinea pig were similar to those seen in human eyes wearing contact lenses. Also, three different models for CLARE/IK were developed and tested in the guinea pig eye. The pathological features of CLARE/IK in the guinea pig were virtually identical to those observed in human eyes. Bacterial contamination of contact lenses was confirmed to be a major risk factor for the development of CLARE/IK.  Contact lenses containing nano-particles of silver demonstrated very good antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in-vitro. The silver lenses were able to control the development of CLARE/IK responses in one of the models for CLARE/IK. Silver lenses might be most effective if used to prevent the establishment of a biofilm of bacteria on a lens such as might occur during storage in a contact lens case. Contact lenses were coated with different concentrations of the furanone compounds by physical adsorption and demonstrated good antibacterial activity at higher concentrations. However these concentrations were cytotoxic in-vitro and lower concentrations of furanones did not possess adequate antibacterial activity to control CLARE/IK responses in-vivo.  This thesis has successfully demonstrated that guinea pigs can be used to test the effects of extended wear of contact lenses and developed models to test the pathogenesis of adverse responses such as CLARE/IK. The CLARE/IK models developed could be used to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of these inflammatory conditions and explore the activity of other antimicrobials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contact lenses.</field><field name="subject">Guinea pigs as laboratory animals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sharing network measurements on peer-to-peer networks</field><field name="creator">Fan, Bo, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the extremely rapid development of the Internet in recent years, emerging peer-to-peer network overlays are meeting the requirements of a more sophisticated communications environment, providing a useful substrate for applications such as scalable file sharing, data storage, large-scale multicast, web-cache, and publish-subscribe services. Due to its design flexibility, peer-to-peer networks can offer features including self-organization, fault-tolerance, scalability, load-balancing, locality and anonymity. As the Internet grows, there is an urgent requirement to understand real-time network performance degradation. Measurement tools currently used are ping, traceroute and variations of these. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is also used by network administrators to monitor local networks. However, ping and traceroute can only be used temporarily, SNMP can only be deployed at certain points in networks and these tools are incapable of sharing network measurements among end-users. Due to the distributed nature of networking performance data, peer-to-peer overlay networks present an attractive platform to distribute this information among Internet users.  This thesis aims at investigating the desirable locality property of peer-to-peer overlays to create an application to share Internet measurement performance. When measurement data are distributed amongst users, it needs to be localized in the network allowing users to retrieve it when external Internet links fail. Thus, network locality and robustness are the most desirable properties. Although some unstructured overlays also integrate locality in design, they fail to reach rarely located data items. Consequently, structured overlays are chosen because they can locate a rare data item deterministically and they can perform well during network failures. In structured peer-to-peer overlays, Tapestry, Pastry and Chord with proximity neighbour selection, were studied due to their explicit notion of locality. To differentiate the level of locality and resiliency in these protocols, P2Psim simulations were performed. The results show that Tapestry is the more suitable peer-to-peer substrate to build such an application due to its superior localizing data performance. Furthermore, due to the routing similarity between Tapestry and Pastry, an implementation that shares network measurement information was developed on freepastry, verifying the application feasibility. This project also contributes to the extension of P2Psim to integrate with GT-ITM and link failures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Locality.</field><field name="subject">Peer-to-Peer Networks.</field><field name="subject">Network measurements.</field><field name="subject">Peer-to-peer architecture (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of the survival of Lactobacillus fermentum PLC in freeze-drying and in subsequent applications</field><field name="creator">Tran, Lai, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lactobacillus.</field><field name="subject">Freeze-drying.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The aetiology and mechanisms of serious injury in restrained child occupants</field><field name="creator">Brown, Julie, Prince of Wales Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary intervention for injury in children traveling in cars in Australia has involved the mandatory use of a restraint while traveling in a vehicle. This intervention has been successful as evidenced by high restraint usage rates by Australian children and substantial casualty reductions since the 1970&#146;s. However casualty rates have been relatively stagnant over the last couple of decades. Currently more than 3,000 child occupants are seriously injured in Australia every year. There is a need to examine the scope for further preventing injury among restrained child occupants. This thesis presents four interrelated studies examining the factors and mechanisms involved when Australian children are seriously injured while using some form of restraint in a crash. Methods used include retrospective medical record review, in-depth crash investigation and analysis of mass in-depth crash data. Both descriptive and nonparametric statistical analysis techniques, including those that allow for the control of potential confounders, were used. Observations and results indicate there is substantial scope for further reducing serious injury in children traveling in cars in Australia. To realize this reduction there is a need to address the quality of restraint use by children through the development of strategies that not only encourage restraint use, but encourage the correct use of the most appropriate forms of restraint. There is also a need to address the protection provided by restraint systems and vehicles to child occupants in high severity crashes, and in crashes that involve impacts with fixed roadside objects such as trees and poles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Injuries</field><field name="subject">Causes and Theories of Causation</field><field name="subject">Child restraint systems in automobiles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transplanted bush: dislocation, desire and the domestic</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Sally, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Transplanted Bush: Dislocation, Desire and the Domestic takes as its theme the idea of the Australian bush and seeks new ways to represent it within the traditions of Australian figurative landscape painting. The research identifies ways to disrupt the bush brand, a paradigm that has played a significant and romantic role in the construction of Australian national identity, as a rallying point for nationalist sentiment and to sell Australia to the world as a unique tourist destination. The bush, as a space that is anti-city, an idea that generally relies on a British genealogy, and one that is constructed according to hetero-normative strategies, is significant in the creation of Australian identity because it is widely regarded as the real Australia. Real in this context has somehow become distorted to mean those parts of our nation that make us distinct from the rest of the world, while continuing to reflect the values and aspirations of a dominant culture and its heroic history of colonising and domesticating a strange land. The overriding focus of this investigation has been to determine to what extent it is possible to reconceptualize the bush brand so that it can accommodate new themes of identity, particularly in relation to gender and sexuality. This research adopts the position that the bush is an idea that has relied heavily upon myths, legends and mono-cultural perspectives for its construction and, as a result, is open to negotiation. Consequently, this investigation takes place at the very heart of the bush paradigm, within its grand master narratives, by engaging with its symbols and signifiers. It reviews the ideological and representational role played by the traditional model of Australian figurative landscape painting, and considered how it can be reinvested with new signs, symbols, motifs, colours and ideas. By developing and introducing a new vocabulary of signs and symbols that erodes the distinctions between the bush, the urban and the domestic, this research disrupts the internal logic and coherence of the bush brand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rainbow holograms</field><field name="creator">Rush, Amy, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rainbow holography is the medium I have chosen to specialize in. Holography itself uses light as a sculptural element. In regards to my work, rainbow holography stresses the field of experimentation with the light spectrum until a certain point that I define as travelling the superhighway from reality to virtual worlds. My work appears then as the documentation, in the form of rainbow holograms, of this travel. It depicts narrative imagery while capturing the moments I existed in this virtual world set behind the rainbow.  This project aims to present through still, 3D and filmic imagery the co ??? existence of the physical body and its psychological realm. The psychological reality is articulated as a fictional landscape and the rainbow is used as a metaphor for travel between real and virtual worlds. More importantly, I see holography or rainbow holography as a means of crystallising the vision of the unreachable world behind the rainbow. I see my practice as a new way of using this medium by using this rainbow world as subject matter within the rainbow hologram.  By experimenting with combined image processing techniques within rainbow holography, such as analogue white light transmission holograms, full colour digital stereograms, and dot matrix holograms, it becomes possible to generate a synthetic new world. Here each pixel can have the potential to be every color of the rainbow spectrum simultaneously, depending on the angle of the eye of the perceiver. It is here that my investigation through holographic representation has led me to explore and create other worldly landscapes and to extend reality.  Our longing to travel over the rainbow into our imagination is with us from a very young age. For me this desire has lasted well into adulthood and has somehow found itself at the centre of my creations over the last few years. The childlike and na??ve appearance of my imagery has the ability to evoke the feeling in the viewers of the nostalgia they may have felt as a child, when confronted with the intense experience and wonder of the imaginings of the rainbow. My work trades on a misunderstanding that the medium of holography is taken as a direct representation of an existing reality.  My first hologram I???m a rainbow depicts an alter-egotistical projection of myself as a rainbow princess living in a far away fairytale rainbow galaxy, and communicating with earth beings via the technology of the message contained within the hologram. The hologram has often been associated in science fiction with a message to save the planet. This body of work invites viewers to delve into the depths of their imagination, to save this place where I have travelled by believing in it. As in the story of peter pan where the children are asked to clap their hands if they believe in fairies, by others believing in my imagination they are able to save it.  The world within the imagination holds no fixed place; it is a shifting and dynamic space. This quality is shared with the rainbow, which is similarly ephemeral, vanishing and appearing within the eye of the beholder according to weather patterns. The rainbow hologram is a fixed rainbow. When replayed through the eyes of the viewer, the interaction with the real rainbow is recalled, and the viewer enters into the imagination to perceive the work.  Throughout this paper I have referred to concepts and techniques in other fields such as physics, anthropology, art history and theory. My research is by no means intended as primarily a technical examination of the medium of rainbow holography. The holographic environments I have made rearrange elements from the real world with fictitious realities. They make people feel as if they are viewing a world that is real, but which imitates unreal ideas. These holographic environments enable viewers to experience ideas as a real place.  As Rainbow holography is a relatively new medium, and as my own work uses the rainbow as a multi-layered tool I feel it necessary to investigate the appearance of the rainbow in nature and the reaction of humans to the rainbow as a mythical component in ancient cultures. I am interested in investigating how the rainbow has been used a metaphor for travelling from a material world to ???other worlds??? through its presence in various imaging processes through specific art works. The different ways the rainbow has been used have enabled me to more accurately understand my own work as being a nexus between depicting and generating rainbows. Furthermore, in the discussion of the application of rainbow holography I can show that my own work is necessarily different because of the way I am depicting a rainbow to explore undiscovered territory in which I am the author. Finally I look at how holography is perceived by the public, which helps me to explain the way in which my own work is perceived. Deliberately using the idea of an image in its surrounding context has helped to achieve my desired outcome: to make people believe that the world behind the rainbow really does exist and that I have travelled there, and that they too can do so via viewing my work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rainbow.</field><field name="subject">Art and holography.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional differences in HRM practices- the case of family businesses in the People??s Republic of China</field><field name="creator">Gao, Fei Yi, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the increasing significance of Chinese family businesses (CFBs) as an important sector in China??s fast-growing economy, family businesses in China have received little research attention in the literature. The aims of this study are two-fold. First, the study examines the current human resource management (HRM) practices of selected family businesses in the country in areas of recruitment and selection, training and development, performance appraisal, and rewards. Second, it investigates differences in HRM practices of CFBs between the eastern-coastal and inland regions of the country. From a questionnaire survey of 205 CFBs operating in seven cities in two regions, this study has found that CFBs combine their traditional informal, relationship-based HR practices with western-style HR practices. Furthermore, both univariate and multivariate analyses have demonstrated significant regional differences in HRM, thus supporting the argument that a firm??s HR practices are shaped by institutions in which the firm operates. The findings of this study make important contributions to both research and practice. First, the findings have provided further evidence to the applicability of institutional theory to the explanation of HRM practices. Second, the study has also provided some practical implications for HR managers of firms, both domestic and foreign, in China. However, results of this study need to be interpreted with caution because external validity is sacrificed to an extent given its focus on family businesses, a non-probability sampling method and relatively small sample size. In addition, the cross-sectional approach adopted in the study fails to identify changes in HRM over time.  Despite the limitations, however, this study has contributed to the body of knowledge by enhancing our understanding of CFBs in China and their HRM that have been under-researched empirically.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family-owned business enterprises -- China</field><field name="subject">Family-owned business enterprises -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of polarised light microscopy as a non-invasive tool for early assessment of human oocytes and embryos</field><field name="creator">Kilani, Suha, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The overall aim was to evaluate a non-invasive technique for the assessment of oocytes and embryos using polarized light microscopy (PolScope-LC) with the goal of improving success rates in IVF. A literature review revealed little validation of the PolScope techniques in published work. A reproducible and accurate method for measuring the zona pellucida (ZP) thickness and density involving the PolScope computer software was validated by achieving low coefficient of variance and small inter/intra observer errors. Utilizing this method, 1477 oocytes from 211 stimulated cycles were analysed in this thesis. Results showed that increasing age has an adverse effect on the ZP thickness and density. Study of extended culturing of embryos showed that the ZP starts thinning as early as day 3 and embryos tend to have denser zonas over time. Standardisation of timing of PolScope observations in relation to the meiotic spindle was studied. Metaphase II oocytes were examined sequentially in culture from aspiration until microinjection using the PolScope The spindle is a highly dynamic structure that can appear and disappear over time in culture. A visible spindle was detected in 58% of the oocytes immediately after aspiration. This percentage increased until it stabilised at 39-40hrs post hCG and then declined significantly. Average spindle signal intensity increased over time reaching its peak at 39-40hrs post hCG, then declined significantly by 40.5hrs post hCG. The importance of spindle presence and morphology was investigated by following up embryos created after sperm injection at 39-40hrs post hCG. There was a significant relationship between normal meiotic spindle shape and density and embryo quality. A higher percentage of ???usable??? embryos, and all of pregnancies, arose from oocytes with a normal barrel shaped spindle. Finally, the impact of two issues related to spindle formation - the type of hCG used to trigger oocyte maturation and the site of microinjection during ICSI were assessed using the PolScope. The results showed a biological difference in spindle formation and embryo quality between rhCG and uhCG. In a separate randomised trial embryo quality was better when injecting the sperm in the vegetal pole away from the spindle during ICSI. The results from this thesis suggest that PolScope, if appropriately applied, may assist in improving IVF outcome.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ovum.</field><field name="subject">Embryos.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reuse of industrial products - a technical and economic model for decision support</field><field name="creator">Anityasari, Maria, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the field of sustainable manufacturing, a wide range of research has been carried out to attain the more effective use of natural resources and the reduction of environmental impacts during the whole product life cycle. This goal can be best achieved by promoting multiple-reuse of parts, sub-assemblies, or entire products. However, the decision toward reusing an old product depends on a variety of parameters with many uncertainties. Therefore, a comprehensive model to assess the reusability of products prior to the reuse decision is urgently needed. The objective of this research has been to develop a comprehensive assessment model, integrating technical, environmental, social, and economic aspects to evaluate the reusability of industrial products. The assessment model consists of four sub-models, which are a methodology to assess the quality and reliability of products, a model to translate the social responsibility aspect into warranty cost, a methodology to integrate environmental costs, and an economic model to accumulate total life cycle cost as the basis of the evaluation. The model also facilitates trade-offs between the factors to investigate the possibility to improve the reusability of a product. To apply the assessment model in the real business environment, a set of decisionmaking methodologies under different take-back scenarios has been developed as a guideline for manufacturers. Furthermore, as the existence of uncertainty in the reuse strategy is undeniable, a methodology to integrate uncertainties into the assessment model is also developed. The model validation, using three real cases collected from industrial partners on consumer and commercial products, has confirmed the applicability of the model to provide a useful tool to evaluate products at the end of their life cycle. The model also enables decision makers to disclose the risk associated with the decision, thus improving the quality of the decision. The results are in good agreement with the basic theory that the reuse and remanufacturing strategy is highly recommended from both environmental and economic reasons.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making -- Methodology</field><field name="subject">Remanufacturing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tacit assumptions of senior managers</field><field name="creator">Dawes, Keith Harold, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents an investigation into the role that tacit knowledge takes in the mental life of senior managers. The research resulted from the author???s work in New South Wales in facilitating assessment and development centres over a five year period, carried out in collaboration with senior managers from several organizations. A frequent comment made by senior managers was that there seemed to be a gulf between the data obtained objectively from behaviourally measured managerial competencies and the senior managers??? own perceptions of their managerial behaviour. Having earlier researched the role of thought processes out of awareness, the author developed the overall aim of the present study ??? to develop some form of training procedures for senior managers that would enhance the use of tacit processes in their managerial behaviours. The present dissertation begins with a literature review related to the development of understanding of the role of tacit processes in the mental life of senior managers. First a review is presented of investigations of organisational behaviour reported in the literature on tacit knowledge, including issues such as learning, teams, leadership, distributed cognition and culture. Study of the role of tacit knowledge was found to be present in the study of management behaviours and during the process of the present research, related publications increased in frequency. Finally a review is presented of psychological research into the nature of tacit knowledge. This focuses on a range of historical and current views and on the author???s own earlier study of implicit learning carried out in the early 1990???s. Study One is focused on examination of the process of coding tacit assumptions. This begins with documentation of the ontology, epistemology and methodology underpinning this research. Grounded theory, a well-recognised method of qualitative analysis, was selected as most appropriate for this study and its philosophy, rationale and methods are presented. The aim of Study One was to examine the effect of repeated interviews on the codifying of tacit assumptions of senior managers. The initial research was with 13 senior managers, who were interviewed either once or on multiple occasions. The initial interviews of two of these senior managers were analysed as pilot studies, and these analyses are presented in the present dissertation. The main body of this research comprises multiple interviews (five each) carried out with two of the original thirteen senior managers. The results confirmed the importance  of the method of investigation but failed to provide any depth of understanding. Apart from consolidating cognitive closure on a set of managerial competencies, attempting to render tacit knowledge explicit (making the tacit conscious) provided no other significant benefit to the senior managers. The extension of some of these previously tacit assumptions into current cognitive functioning, when coded, assisted in the retention of organisational knowledge but offered no real benefit to the senior managers themselves, no depth of self-knowledge. Study Two arose from a more realistic understanding of tacit processes. The aim of Study Two was to find a way of harnessing the influences of tacit assumptions without trying to surface them ??? to make them ???conscious.??? This is consistent with the writings of such researchers as Nonaka (1991), Baumard (1999) and Spender (2005). By adapting an existing method focusing on subtle mental processes (developed by Norm Kagan in the context of teaching counselling skills and developed further for research first by Diment, Walker and Hammer and then by Sheehan and McConkey ), the author has further developed a technique (The Explicit/Tacit Interface Technique ??? ET~IT) that accesses the tacit processes in the service of the senior manager???s aims. A multiperspective analysis was applied to the feedback interviews of six subjects. This generated a set of characteristics of the ET~IT that hold promise for it to become a useful management development tool. Cohen and Levinthal???s (1990) concept of ???absorptive capacity??? is discussed as a possible starting point for indicating individual differences in successful interfacing with tacit processes. Finally recommendations for further improvement, consideration of constraints and their minimization and methods for evaluating future research into the tacit assumptions of senior managers are presented. Study Two concludes with discussion of how the results can be used as part of senior management development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tacit knowledge.</field><field name="subject">Managers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Appendicitis protects against colitis: an exploration of underlying immune mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Ng, Wa Sang Watson, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Inflammatory bowel disease-(IBD) is a chronic relapsing and remitting disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterised by inflammation. The underlying immunopathogenesis is unknown but excessive effector and defective regulatory immune responses play a significant role. The aetiology of IBD is not yet fully resolved, but interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut flora, contribute significantly to the development of IBD. Appendicectomy for intra-abdominal inflammatory conditions before the age of 20 protects against colitis. The mechanism underlying this protective effect is unclear. This thesis examined the hypothesis that appendiceal regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) mediate the protection. Despite human and murine data showing that the appendix is involved in the prevention of colitis, few studies of human or murine appendices have been reported. A novel murine model of appendicitis was created using an operative technique of band-ligation of an induced-tubular-appendix. Histological assessment showed that this model recapitulated all of the histological features of human acute appendicitis, namely mucosal ulceration, transmural neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration and serositis. This local pathology was associated with a systemic host response, evidenced by raised serum Creactive- protein. The impact of inflammation on the appendiceal lymphocyte constituents was assessed by flow cytometry. The inflammation caused a shift from B-lymphocyte to T-lymphocyte predominance. In particular there was a 75% increment in Treg numbers, which was restricted to juvenile mice only (&amp;lt 10 weeks old). Furthermore, appendiceal Treg expressed the gut-homing chemokine-receptor, CCR9, and the intestine-specific integrin, &#945;4&#946;7. These cells were shown to preferentially migrate to the colonic lamina propria. Lastly, appendicitis and appendicectomy protected against TNBS-colitis which was also restricted to juvenile mice. Evidence for antigen dependence was suggested by the effect being heightened when mice were pre-sensitised against TNBS. Exploration of the colonic lamina propria (cLP) lymphocyte population showed an increase in Treg, especially CD8+Foxp3+- Treg, in ??protected?? mice only, which may have originated in the appendix. Intracytoplasmic cytokine detection showed that these cLP-Treg were potent producers of the regulatory cytokine, IL-10. These findings strongly suggest that appendicitis triggers an expansion of Treg which then emigrate to the colon and mediate long-lasting protection against colitis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Appendicitis</field><field name="subject">Colitis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factor analysis of high dimensional time series</field><field name="creator">Heaton, Chris, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of research into the use of factor models for stationary economic time series. Two basic scenarios are considered. The first is a situation where a large number of observations are available on a relatively small number variables, and a dynamic factor model is specified. It is shown that a dynamic factor model may be derived as a representation of a VARMA model of reduced spectral rank observed subject to measurement error. In some cases the resulting factor model corresponds to a minimal state-space representation of the VARMA plus noise model. Identification is discussed and proved for a fairly general class of dynamic factor model, and a frequency domain estimation procedure is proposed which has the advantage of generalising easily to models with rich dynamic structures. The second scenario is one where both the number of variables and the number of observations jointly diverge to infinity. The principal components estimator is considered in this case, and consistency is proved under assumptions which allow for much more error cross-correlation than the previously published theorems. Ancillary results include finite sample/variables bounds linking population principal components to population factors, and consistency results for principal components in a dual limit framework under a `gap' condition on the eigenvalues. A new factor model, named the Grouped Variable Approximate Factor Model, is introduced. This factor model allows for arbitrarily strong correlation between some of the errors, provided that the variables corresponding to the strongly correlated errors may be arranged into groups. An approximate instrumental variables estimator is proposed for the model and consistency is proved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time series</field><field name="subject">factor analysis</field><field name="subject">principal components</field><field name="subject">Time-series analysis -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy-aware synthesis for networks on chip architectures</field><field name="creator">Chan, Jeremy, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Network on Chip (NoC) paradigm was introduced as a scalable communication infrastructure for future System-on-Chip applications. Designing application specific customized communication architectures is critical for obtaining low power, high performance solutions. Two significant design automation problems are the creation of an optimized configuration, given application requirement the implementation of this on-chip network. Automating the design of on-chip networks requires models for estimating area and energy, algorithms to effectively explore the design space and network component libraries and tools to generate the hardware description. Chip architects are faced with managing a wide range of customization options for individual components, routers and topology. As energy is of paramount importance, the effectiveness of any custom NoC generation approach lies in the availability of good energy models to effectively explore the design space. This thesis describes a complete NoC synthesis ???ow, called NoCGEN, for creating energy-efficient custom NoC architectures. Three major automation problems are addressed: custom topology generation, energy modeling and generation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to generate application specific point-to-point and packet-switched networks. The algorithm explores the design space for efficient topologies using characterized models and a system-level ???oorplanner for evaluating placement and wire-energy. Prior to our contribution, building an energy model required careful analysis of transistor or gate implementations. To alleviate the burden, an automated linear regression-based methodology is proposed to rapidly extract energy models for many router designs. The resulting models are cycle accurate with low-complexity and found to be within 10% of gate-level energy simulations, and execute several orders of magnitude faster than gate-level simulations. A hardware description of the custom topology is generated using a parameterizable library and custom HDL generator. Fully reusable and scalable network components (switches, crossbars, arbiters, routing algorithms) are described using a template approach and are used to compose arbitrary topologies. A methodology for building and composing routers and topologies using a template engine is described. The entire flow is implemented as several demonstrable extensible tools with powerful visualization functionality. Several experiments are performed to demonstrate the design space exploration capabilities and compare it against a competing min-cut topology generation algorithm.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Networks on a chip.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bromine complexing agents for use in vanadium bromide (V/Br) redox flow cell</field><field name="creator">Poon, Grace, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Vanadium bromide (V/Br) flow cell employs the Br3-/Br- couple in the positive and the V(II)/V(III) couple in the negative half cell. One major issue of this flow cell is bromine gas formation in the positive half cell during charging which results from the low solubility of bromine in aqueous solutions. Bromine complexing agents previously used in the zinc-bromine fuel cell were evaluated for their applicability in V/Br flow cell electrolytes. Three quaternary ammonium bromides: N-ethyl-N-methyl-morpholinium bromide (MEM), N-ethyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidinium bromide (MEP) and Tetra-butyl ammonium bromide (TBA) were studied. It is known that aqueous bromine reacts with quaternary ammonium bromides to form an immiscible organic phase. Depending on the number of quaternary ammonium bromides used and the environmental temperature, the second phase formed will either be solid or liquid. As any solid formation would interrupt the flow cell operation, potential formation of such kind has to be eliminated. Stability tests of simulated V/Br electrolyte with added quaternary ammonium bromides were carried out at 11, 25 and 40 oC. In the absence of bromine, the addition of MEM, MEP and TBA were found to be stable in V/Br electrolytes. However, in the presence of bromine, solid formation was observed in the bromine rich organic phase when the V/Br electrolyte contained a single quaternary ammonium bromide (QBr) compound. For V/Br electrolytes with binary or ternary QBr mixtures containing TBA, the presence of bromine caused a viscous polybromide phase to form at room temperature and the release of bromine gas at higher temperature. Only a binary mixture of MEM and MEP formed a stable liquid organic phase between 11 ?? 40 oC. In this study it was found that V/Br electrolytes containing a binary QBr mixture (0.75M) of MEM and MEP gave the best combination that formed an orange oily layer in the presence of bromine without solidification between 11 ?? 40oC. Furthermore, it was found that samples of V/Br electrolytes containing a ternary QBr mixture, are less effective in bromine capturing if the total QBr concentration was less than 1 M at 40oC, where bromine gas evolution was observed. From electrochemical studies of V3+/V2+, it was found that the addition of MEM and MEP had a minimal effect on the formal potential of the V3+/V2+ couple, the V2+/V3+ transfer coefficient and the diffusion coefficient of V3+. Therefore, MEM and MEP can be added to the negative half-cell of a V/Br flow cell without major interference From linear sweep voltammetry, the kinetics of the Br-/Br3- redox couple was found to be mass transfer controlled. After the addition of MEM and MEP mixture, the exchange current density was found to decrease from 0.013 Acm-2 to 0.01 Acm-2. On the other hand the transfer coefficient before and after MEM and MEP addition was found to be 0.5 and 0.44 respectively. Since the kinetic parameters were not significantly affected by the addition of MEM and MEP mixture, they can be added to the positive half-cell of the V/Br flow cell as bromine complexing agents. The electrochemical studies of both V3+/V2+ and Br-/Br3- showed the addition of MEM and MEP has minimal interference with the redox reactions of the vanadium bromide flow cell. This thesis also investigated the effect of MEM and MEP addition on the cell performance of a lab scale V/Br flow cell using two different membranes (ChiNaf and VF11). Flow cell performance for 2 M V3.7+ + 0.19 M MEM + 0.56 M MEP electrolytes utilising ChiNaf membrane at 10 mAcm-2 produced an energy efficiency of 59%, and this decreased to 43% after 15 cycles. For the static cell utilising VF11 membrane, the addition of MEM and MEP reduced the energy efficiency from 59.7% to 43.4%. It is believed that this is caused by the mass transfer controlled Br-/Br3- couple in the complexed positive half-cell solution. Therefore, uniformity between the organic and aqueous phase is important for flow cells utilising electrolytes with MEM and MEP. Finally, the polarization resistance of a lab scale V/Br flow cell utilising ChiNaf membrane and 2 M V3.7+ electrolytes was found to be slightly higher during cell charging (3.9 &#61527;&#61472;cm2) than during the discharge process (3.6 &#61527;&#61472;cm2), which is opposed to that in the all-vanadium redox cell.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quaternary ammonium bromide (QBr)</field><field name="subject">Vanadium Bromide Redox Flow Cell</field><field name="subject">Redox Flow Cell</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on the distributional impacts of government</field><field name="creator">Siminski, Peter, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of three independent essays, unified by the common theme of the distributional impacts of government.  The first paper estimates the price elasticity of demand for pharmaceuticals amongst high-income older people in Australia. It exploits a natural experiment by which some people gained entitlement to a price reduction through the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC). The preferred model is a nonlinear Instrumental Variable (IV) difference-in-difference regression, estimated on repeated cross sectional survey data using the Generalised Method of Moments. No significant evidence is found for endogenous card take-up, and so cross-sectional estimates are also considered. Taking all of the results and possible sources of bias into account, the ??headline?? estimate is -0.1, implying that quantity demanded is not highly responsive to price.  The elasticity estimate is a key input into the second paper which analyses the distributional impact of the CSHC. I consider the trade-off between moral hazard and risk pooling. There have been few previous attempts internationally to address this trade-off empirically for any health insurance scheme. The utility gain through risk-pooling is found to be negligible. However, the deadweight loss through moral hazard may be considerable. I also use an illustrative model to demonstrate the possible effects of the CSHC on inter-temporal savings behaviour. While the CSHC may induce some people to save, it may have the opposite effect on others. The net impact was not determined.  The third paper estimates the Australian public sector wage premium. It includes a detailed critical review of the methods available to address this issue. The chosen approach is a quasi-differenced panel data model, estimated by nonlinear IV, which has many advantages over other methods and has not been used before for this topic. I find a positive average public sector wage premium for both sexes. The best estimates are 10.0% for men and 7.1% for women. The estimate for men is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.04) and borders on significance for women (p &lt; 0.07). No evidence is found to suggest that the public sector has an equalising effect on the wages of its workers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wages</field><field name="subject">public sector</field><field name="subject">pharmaceuticals</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">price elasticity</field><field name="subject">recipient value</field><field name="subject">health insurance</field><field name="subject">natural experiment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity, phylogeny and biostratigraphy of diprotodontoids (marsupialia: diprotodontidae, palorchestidae) from the Riversleigh world heritage area</field><field name="creator">Black, Karen, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The extinct diprotodontoids were large bodied, browsing herbivorous marsupials most closely related to, among living marsupials, wombats. Referred to two families, Diprotodontidae and Palorchestidae, diprotodontoids are geographically and temporally widespread vombatimorphian taxa in Australian and New Guinean Cenozoic deposits. The most diverse diprotodontoid fauna recorded from any single region in Australia comes from Oligo-Miocene limestone deposits of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland. In this thesis a new diprotodontoid genus and five new species are described from Riversleigh, as well as additional material from Riversleigh for the palorchestids Propalorchestes novaculacephalus and Pr. ponticulus and diprotodontids Nimbadon lavarackorum, Neohelos tirarensis, Neohelos stirtoni and Ngapakaldia bonythoni. A new vombatomorphian family, Maradidae, known from a single species at Riversleigh, is recognised as the sister-group of a vombatid-diprotodontoid clade.  New abundant, exceptionally well-preserved cranial material of the zygomaturine Nimbadon lavarackorum enables characterisation of intraspecific variation and ontogenetic development. The results of these analyses have been used to discriminate species boundaries throughout this work.  Consequently: Nimbadon whitelawi is now considered a junior synonym of Ni. lavarackorum; Nimbadon scottorrorum is a junior synonym of Neohelos tirarensis; and Bematherium angulum is a synonym of Ngapakaldia bonythoni. The new Riversleigh diprotodontoids clarify phylogenetic relationships within and between diprotodontoid families.  The monophyly of both Palorchestidae and Diprotodontidae is strongly supported as is their union in the superfamily Diprotodontoidea. Monophyly of the Zygomaturinae and Diprotodontinae is not supported, primarily due to the unstable position of Alkwertatherium webbi as well as the high degree of homoplasy in cranial morphology of the more derived members of each subfamily.  Overall phylogenetic and distribution patterns for diprotodontoids is generally consistent with current interpretations of Riversleigh's stratigraphy.  Five diprotodontoid species allow direct biocorrelation with other Australian Tertiary mammal faunas. Riversleigh's basal System A deposits correlate with late Oligocene deposits of the Etadunna Formation of South Australia. Riversleigh's low-mid System C deposits correlate with the middle Miocene Bullock Creek Local Fauna of the Northern Territory. Riversleigh's high System C Jaw Junction and Encore Local Faunas contain diprotodontoid taxa antecedent to diprotodontoids of the late Miocene Alcoota Local Fauna of the Northern Territory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systematics.</field><field name="subject">Diprotodontoidea.</field><field name="subject">Ontogeny.</field><field name="subject">Maradidae.</field><field name="subject">Oligocene.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collaboration and international trade</field><field name="creator">Luechaikajohnpan, Pinijsorn, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Over the last two decades there has been a tremendous increase in collaboration among competing firms. A significant number of these collaborations are international. This thesis explores the incentives and welfare consequences of collaboration in the context of international trade. We consider two types of cross-border collaborations. The first is collaboration by sharing a part of firms' value creating activities, such as technology development, product design and distribution. This saves on production costs but reduces product distinctiveness. Firms collaborate if and only if the reduction in product distinctiveness is lower than a threshold level. We find that the threshold increases with an increase in trade costs. That is, an increase in trade costs makes collaboration more likely. Higher trade cost lowers competition, which in turn enables the firms to save on fixed costs while forgoing some product distinctiveness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that contrary to standard intuition, higher trade cost could enhance consumers' welfare by inducing competitors to collaborate. We extend our model to endogenise location choice by the firms where collaboration requires co-location (due to the benefit of local spillovers or joint investment in key infrastructures). Unlike the original model, we find that an increase in trade costs can discourage collaboration. In both circumstances, we find that an increase in trade cost can improve consumer surplus. The second type of collaboration considered in this thesis is licensing. We extend the standard licensing literature to an environment where firms compete in the domestic as well as foreign market. We examine how trade cost affects the licensing decision as well as the optimal payment mechanism. We find that an increase in trade costs reduces the possibility of licensing. Concerning the payment mechanism, we find that (i) either royalty or (ii) a two-part tariff (involving a fixed fee as well as royalty payments) is optimal. An increase in trade costs reduces the likelihood of royalty only being the optimal payment mechanism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">licensing</field><field name="subject">competitor collaboration</field><field name="subject">trade cost</field><field name="subject">product distinctiveness</field><field name="subject">location choice</field><field name="subject">International trade</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances (Business) -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated methodology for assessing physical and technological life of products for reuse</field><field name="creator">Rugrungruang, Fatida, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Strategies for reuse of components are important in order to create a closed loop manufacturing system.  Over decades, the notion has been gaining ground due to environmental and legislative reasons. Reuse of components is desirable and in many cases might be economically beneficial. However, the implementation of reuse strategies has been hindered by the requirement of reliable methodologies to assess the remaining life and reuse potential of used components. The estimation of the remaining life is problematic as the useful life of a component is affected by several causes of obsolescence. The common causes are due to physical and technological issues. So far, little research has attempted to address these issues simultaneously, and integrating them. This thesis seeks to develop methodologies that aid in predicting the integrated remaining lifetime of used components. There are three core parts of this research. First, the methodology determines the remaining life of used components from the physical lifetime perspective. This was derived from the estimation of physical failure using failure rate data, and the statistical analysis of usage intensity age as obtained from customers survey. Second, the research presents the use of the technological forecasting technique to predict the remaining technological life. As it is influenced by the technology progress, the forecast was developed on the basis of product technology clusters and market trend extrapolation analysis. Finally, the resulting estimations from the two aspects were combined to obtain an integrated assessment for estimating the remaining life of components. The potential for components in a product to be reused is justified when the remaining life is greater than the average expected lifespan of the product. Two cases of domestic appliances &#150; televisions and washing machines were used to highlight and demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology. The results show that the proposed method provides the practitioners with a promising tool for end-of-life decision making. This is in particularly attractive when used as a preliminary decision support tool prior to the time consuming and costly processes such as disassembly and quality testing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Component Reuse</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Manufacturing</field><field name="subject">Life Cycle Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A knowledge-based engineering tool for aiding in the conceptual design of composite yachts</field><field name="creator">Payne, Rozetta Mary, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Proposed in this thesis is a methodology to enable yacht designers to develop innovative structural concepts, even when the loads experienced by the yacht are highly uncertain, and has been implemented in sufficient detail to confirm the feasibility of this new approach. The new approach is required because today??s yachts are generally lighter, getting larger and going faster. The question arises as to how far the design envelope can be pushed with the highly uncertain loads experienced by the structure? What are the effects of this uncertainty and what trade-offs in the structural design will best meet the overall design objectives?  The new approach provides yacht designers with a means of developing innovative structural solutions that accommodate high levels of uncertainty, but still focus on best meeting design objectives constrained by trade-offs in weight, safety and cost. The designer??s preferences have a large, and not always intuitive, influence on the necessary design trade-offs. This in turn invites research into ways to formally integrate decision algorithms into knowledge-based design systems.  A lean and robust design system has been achieved by developing a set of tools which are blanketed by a fuzzy decision algorithm. The underlying tool set includes costing, material optimisation and safety analysis. Central to this is the innovative way in which the system allows non-discrete variables to be utilized along with new subjective measures of structural reliability based on load path algorithms and topological (shape) optimisation.  The originality in this work is the development of a knowledge-based framework and methodology that uses a fuzzy decision making tool to navigate through a design space and address trade-offs between high level objectives when faced with limited design detail and uncertainty. In so doing, this work introduces the use of topological optimisation and load path theory to the structural design of yachts as a means of overcoming the historical focus of knowledge-based systems and to ensure that innovative solutions can still evolve. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which can quantify a design??s robustness in a system that focuses on a global approach to the measurement of objectives such as cost, weight and safety. Results from the application of this system show new and innovative structural solutions evolving that take into account the designers preferences regarding cost, weight and safety while accommodating uncertain parameters such as the loading experienced by the hull.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Yacht Design</field><field name="subject">Knowledge-Based Engineering</field><field name="subject">Composite Structures</field><field name="subject">Load Path Theory</field><field name="subject">Topological Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Process Based Costing</field><field name="subject">Genetic Plystack Optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aberations of self : manifestations in cinema histories</field><field name="creator">Douglas, John Anthony, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Screen Test (Americana/Australiana) project is a collection of works that re-makes selected fragments of film spanning cinema history. Through a process of selectively slowing and stilling this form, of what Laura Mulvey  calls Delayed Cinema, opens up new possibilities for interpreting and understanding cinema and the photographic. The aesthetic qualities and repetition of the scene or shot are re-created and re-performed, allowing an alternate form of cinema to take place. This alternate cinema takes on the characteristic of the Hollywood screen test and thus we can see each piece as the artist performing the screen test for each film. However, over time the screen test becomes the site for shifting the aesthetic elements within the film and shaping the narrative as a form of aesthetic building block. The viewing of each fragment allows for a new reading of film that suspends or subverts the temporal narrative and allows the contained segment to exist outside of the film opening up the possibility of constructing and emphasizing new iconic images and meanings. Each video piece is supplemented with a photographic still in tableaux form that further explores the aesthetic material of the film or shot raising the aesthetic components of the film ( props, locations etc) to the level of fetishism that may have been missed in the original version. This photographic rendering of the film fragment rethinks the possibilities of photographic tableaux and its relation to the iconic and indexical of photomedia art practice. Similarly, each photographic work is informed by theories of film analysis and psychology that has examined the primacy of the film still with Freudian notions of the primal scene and the uncanny.  We are after all bringing to life the graveyard of cinema history. These photographic qualities of the mis en scene and the indexical of metonymy allow a heightened aesthetic experience, which transforms itself into an aberration of the director&#146;s intended meaning, thereby reconstructing this meaning within the context of camp humour and irony. The work also acts as a playful and absurd interpretation of the cult of celebrity within cinema and the art world, which frees up of the interpretation of the film&#146;s meaning and becomes the site for contemporary re-readings of film culture.  The juxtaposition of the American Hollywood film and its emphasis on studio lighting, props, character and dialogue against the outdoor location of the Australian films conflates the two cultural imperatives, allowing for the examination of cultural myth through cinema. American cinema is revealed as the dominant culture whose imperialism dogs Australian film  and fosters a culture of low self-esteem. Further, the Americana works become the site for cultural examinations of gender, narcissism and war - both real and imagined &#150; and Hollywood is explored in terms of its social imaginings and how they play into real life events. The Australiana component explores the mythology of the Australian landscape with an emphasis on the culture of masculinity and self-destructive violence. However, each work is the result of a conflation of both cultures and other films, or parts of the same film, shifted within the fragment. The production of each photographic and video piece requires the taking on of the role of director, cinematographer, actor and producer. Through the use of interactive technologies such as DVD and the Internet not only am I able to experience a new subjective relationship with the intricacies of cinema but also by recreating these cinematic fragments I am able to bring into being and transform the spectre of cinema into the realm of contemporary art practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contemporary art</field><field name="subject">Cinema</field><field name="subject">Photomedia</field><field name="subject">Film psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">Video art</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures -- Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Motion picture plays -- History and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Channel shortening equalizers for UWB receiver design simplification</field><field name="creator">Syed, Imtiaz Husain, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ultra Wideband (UWB) communication systems occupy large bandwidths with very low power spectral densities. This feature makes UWB channels highly rich in multipaths. To exploit the temporal diversity, a UWB receiver usually incorporates Rake reception. Each multipath in the channel carries just a fraction of the signal energy. This phenomenon dictates a Rake receiver with a large number of fingers to achieve good energy capture and output signal to noise ratio (SNR). Eventually, the Rake structure becomes very complex from analysis and design perspectives and incurs higher manufacturing cost. The first contribution of this thesis is to propose channel shortening or time domain equalization as a technique to reduce the complexity of the UWB Rake receiver. It is analyzed that most of the existing channel shortening equalizer (CSE) designs are either system specific or optimize a parameter not critical or even available in UWB systems. The CSE designs which are more generic and use commonly critical cost functions may perform poorly due to particular UWB channel profiles and related statistical properties. Consequently, the main contribution of the thesis is to propose several CSE designs to address the specific needs of UWB systems. These CSE designs not only exploit some general but also some UWB specific features to perform the task more efficiently. The comparative analysis of the proposed CSEs, some existing designs and the conventional Rake structures leads towards the conclusion. It is finally shown that the use of CSE at the receiver front end greatly simplifies the Rake structure and the associated signal processing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rake receivers</field><field name="subject">UWB</field><field name="subject">Channel shortening</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A participatory, action-oriented and youth-led investigation into child domestic work in Iringa, Tanzania</field><field name="creator">Klocker, Natascha, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has two distinct yet interrelated parts. In the first instance, it investigates child domestic work in Iringa ? a small town in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Second, it examines the participatory action research methodology that was adopted as part of that investigation. Data were collected by a team of researchers that included children and young people who had themselves been domestic workers. A questionnaire, interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with local leaders, employers of child domestic workers and (both current and former) child domestic workers themselves. An agenda for change - that aimed towards the redistribution of power within domestic working arrangements - was developed on the basis of those data and presented to local government authorities in Iringa. This research makes a number of contributions to understandings of both child domestic work and participatory action research methodologies. First, the thesis contends that child domestic work is a complex activity which (despite its frequently exploitative and abusive character) should not be identified as a purely harmful force in the lives of young employees. The multiplicity of ways in which that occupation is experienced can only be uncovered through the incorporation of a range of stakeholders? perspectives. Second, this research found that notions of ?family? were discursively linked to child domestic working arrangements in Iringa. This has inhibited recognition of child domestic work as ?real work?, and contributed to the exploitation of these young employees. This thesis contends that increased formalisation and regulation of child domestic work would offer an opportunity to reconstruct child domestic workers as ?employees? and thereby improve their circumstances. This research has also challenged prevalent notions of children?s incompetence and shown that young people with minimal formal education can (and should) participate as co-researchers in academic endeavours investigating their lives. However, it has also found that young people?s competencies and interests vary, and that notions of appropriate participatory processes have often failed to take such diversity into account. This thesis contends that more participatory forms of evaluation may allow greater flexibility (and relevance) to be fostered when assessing the ?success? of participatory processes. Academics need to be alert to the alienating effects that (unwittingly) ?judgemental? and (unrealistically) ?perfect? accounts of participatory and action-oriented research processes can have on young scholars.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">domestic work</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">Domestics</field><field name="subject">Participant observation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overt and covert partcipation of learners in Japanese language classrooms</field><field name="creator">Yoshida, Reiko, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates corrective-feedback episodes and learners?? private speech in Japanese language classrooms at a university to examine both overt and covert speech of the adult learners in relation to their target language learning. Corrective-feedback episodes between teachers and learners in language classrooms have been focused on as typical interactions in the classrooms and a factor that contributes to learning of target languages. Ohta (2001) found that learners noticed their teachers?? corrective feedback to the other learners and responded to the feedback in their private speech, and that they also repeated others or manipulated sounds or forms by using their private speech. As learners notice a gap between what they actually can produce and what they want to say, when they produce target languages, even without feedback (Swain, 1985; Swain and Lapkin, 1995), learners?? private speech should be examined as well as their corrective-feedback episodes in classrooms. The data were collected from six learners and two teachers at a Level 2 (upper beginning) Japanese course for two semesters (throughout a year). The data are composed of classroom observations, audio and video-recordings of the classrooms, and stimulated recall interviews with both the teachers and the learners following the classroom recordings. All corrective-feedback episodes and the learners?? private speech were transcribed and coded according to error type, corrective-feedback type, types of response to the feedback, and types of the learners?? private speech. The teachers tended to use recasts often because of the time limitation of the classroom teaching and their teaching policy. However, all the learners preferred to be given opportunities to self-correct their own errors before being provided with correct answers by recasts. Private speech had functions of cognitive/metacognitive, affective/social, and self-regulation, which overlapped with each other. The learners were aware of their use of private speech in the classrooms. The teachers sometimes noticed their learners?? use of private speech in the classes. The learners used both Japanese and English as cognitive tools as well as communicative tools. The learners used every opportunity for their learning, by overtly and covertly participating, in the class.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Private speech</field><field name="subject">Classroom speech</field><field name="subject">Corrective feedback</field><field name="subject">Japanese language -- Study and teaching -- English speakers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multi-channel real-time GPS position location system</field><field name="creator">Parkinson, Kevin James, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since its introduction in the early 1980??s, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become an important worldwide resource. Although the primary use of GPS is for position location, the inherent timing accuracy built into the system has allowed it become an important synchronisation resource for other systems. In most cases the GPS end user only requires a position estimate without awareness of the timing and synchronisation aspects of the system. A low accuracy position (at the several-metre level) with a low update rate of about 1Hz is often acceptable. However, obtaining more accurate position estimates (at the sub-metre level) at higher update rates requires the use of differential correction signals (DGPS) and greater processing power in the receiver.  Furthermore, some extra challenges arise when simultaneously gathering information from a group of independently moving remote GPS receivers (rovers) at increased sampling rates (10Hz). This creates the need for a high bandwidth telemetry system and techniques to synchronise the position measurements for tracking each rover. This thesis investigates and develops an overall solution to these problems using GPS for both position location and synchronisation. A system is designed to generate relative position information from 30 or more rovers in real-time. The important contributions of this research are as follows: a) A GPS synchronised telemetry system is developed to transport GPS data from each rover. Proof of concept experiments show why a conventional RF Local Area Network (LAN) is not suitable for this application. The new telemetry system is developed using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices to embed both the synchronising logic and the central processor. b) A new system architecture is developed to reduce the processing load of the GPS receiver. Furthermore, the need to transfer the DGPS correction data to the rover is eliminated. Instead, the receiver raw data is processed in a centralised Kalman filter to produce multiple position estimates in real-time. c) Steps are taken to optimise the telemetry data stream by using only the bare essential data from each rover. A custom protocol is developed to deliver the GPS receiver raw data to the central point with minimal latency. The central software is designed to extract and manage common elements such as satellite ephemeris data from the central reference receiver only. d) Methods are developed to make the overall system more robust by identifying and understanding the points of failure, providing fallback options to allow recovery with minimal impact. Based on the above a system is designed and integrated using a mixture of custom hardware, custom software and off-the-shelf hardware. Overall tests show that efforts to minimise latency, minimise power requirements and improve reliability have delivered good results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TDMA</field><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">GPS receivers</field><field name="subject">Synchronization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equivocal empire: British community development in Central Africa, 1945-55</field><field name="creator">Kark, Daniel, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis resituates the Community Development programme as the key social intervention attempted by the British Colonial Office in Africa in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A preference for planning, growing confidence in metropolitan intervention, and the gradualist determination of Fabian socialist politicians and experts resulted in a programme that stressed modernity, progressive individualism, initiative, cooperative communities and a new type of responsible citizenship. Eventual self-rule would be well-served by this new contract between colonial administrations and African citizens.  The thesis focuses on the implementation of the Mass Education programme in Nyasaland, and, more specifically, on a small but significant Mass Education scheme at Domasi, that operated between 1949 and 1954 in Nyasaland??s south. The political and social context in which the Mass Education scheme was implemented in Nyasaland is important. The approach taken by the government of the Protectorate before the mid-1940s is discussed, and previous welfare interventions described and critically assessed. The initial approach to Mass Education in Nyasaland is also dwelt upon in some detail. The narrative concentrates upon the scheme itself. Three themes emerge and are discussed successively ?? the provision of social services adapted to the perceived needs of Africans, the enforcement of environmental restrictions and inappropriate social and agricultural models, and the attempted introduction of representative local government. All three interventions were intended to promote the precepts of Mass Education, but instead resulted in the extension of state administrative power. The manner in which this occurred is explored throughout the thesis.  Mass Education at Domasi did not result in the creation of a new form of citizenship in Nyasaland. It contributed instead to a breakdown in the narrative of social development and eventual self-rule that had legitimised British rule. The riots that occurred in 1953 tore at the precepts that underpinned the Mass Education programme. The immediacy of self-rule and independence resulted in a shift in emphasis within the Colonial Office and the colonial government in Nyasaland from social intervention and to constitutional reform and political development. There simultaneously emerged a new rural transcript, one that privileged open opposition to the colonial social prescription over subtle and hidden rural resistance. At a time when nationalist politics was in disarray in Nyasaland, rural Africans spoke back to colonial power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">British Africa</field><field name="subject">Mass Education</field><field name="subject">Community Development</field><field name="subject">colonial</field><field name="subject">malawi</field><field name="subject">Community development -- Africa</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- Social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional and metabolic responses of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the addition of L-serine</field><field name="creator">Lee, Johnny Chien-Yi, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sudden changes in nutrient resources are common in the natural environment. Cells are able to adapt and propagate under changing environmental conditions by making adjustments in their cellular processes. These cellular adaptations involve genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming that results in the induction or repression of metabolic pathways. Specific enzymes are then synthesised and activated to maximise the use of the newly available nutrient sources.             L-serine is one of the twenty proteinogenic amino acids, and can be synthesised in yeast by the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways when growing on fermentable or non-fermentable carbon sources or taken up from the environment when available. L-serine is metabolically linked to glycine and is a predominant donor of one-carbon units in one-carbon metabolism. L-serine is also a source of pyruvate and ammonia and contributes to other cellular processes including the biosynthesis of cysteine and phospholipids.             Previous work has shown that yeast cells exhibit transcriptional induction of the one-carbon pathway and the genes involved in the synthesis of purine and methionine after the addition of 10 mM glycine. Here it is shown that addition of 10 mM L-serine did not, however,  elicit the same transcriptional response. This is primarily due to differences in the uptake of glycine and L-serine in yeast. High concentrations of extracellular L-serine were required for yeast to show an increase in intracellular L-serine concentration of the magnitude required to trigger a noticeable cellular response. Despite L-serine and glycine being interconvertable via the SHMT isozymes and being a one-carbon donor, the genome-wide transcriptional response exhibited by cells in response to L-serine addition was markedly different to that seen for glycine. The predominant response to an increase in intracellular L-serine was the induction of the general amino acid control system and the CHA1 gene encoding the serine (threonine) dehydratase. Unlike glycine, addition of L-serine triggered only minor induction of the one-carbon pathway. A large portion of intracellular L-serine was converted to pyruvate and ammonia in the mitochondrion as the result of induction of CHA1. The high intracellular concentration of L-serine stimulated the cell to increase the production of oxaloacetate and to increase the biosynthesis of L-aspartate. Transient increases in the intracellular L-glutamate and L-glutamine were also observed after the addition of L-serine.             The work presented in this study shows that large increase in the intracellular concentration of amino acid is required to trigger a significant transcriptional response. Yeast cells exhibit different transcriptional and metabolic responses to the addition of L-serine and glycine even though these two amino acids are closely metabolically linked. Addition of L-serine provokes the GAAC response, expression of the CHA1 gene and stimulates the biosynthesis of L-aspartate in yeast whereas addition of glycine induces the one-carbon pathway which leads to the biosynthesis of the purine nucleotides.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yeast.</field><field name="subject">L-serine.</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</field><field name="subject">Amino acids -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Amino acids -- Biosynthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A simulation model for quantifying and reducing the bullwhip effect</field><field name="creator">Wangphanich, Pilada, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Over the past of decade, the bullwhip effect has increasingly become a popular topic for researchers and practitioners in the area of supply chain management since it negatively influences cost, inventory, reliability and other important business processes in supply chain agents. Although there are many remedies for the bullwhip effect summarised in existing literature, it still occurs in several industries. This is partly because it is difficult to apply the results from existing research which analyse the bullwhip effect mainly in a simple supply chain. In addition, several tools and methodologies developed are used for analysing the bullwhip effect in a simple supply chain with several constraints.  Therefore, this research aims to develop a unique simulation approach based on system dynamics modelling and Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for quantifying and reducing the bullwhip effect in a multi-product, multi-stage supply chain. System dynamics modelling which is a powerful simulation approach for studying and managing complex feedback system was selected as a main tool in this research. In addition, ANFIS was implemented in system dynamics modelling in order to increase the reliability of a system dynamics model for modelling soft variables. The proposed model covers variables influencing the bullwhip effect which are the structure of supply chain network, supply chain contributions and supply chain performances. As a result, a two layer simulation with three generic models was developed. The flexibility of this proposed model is the ability to model various types of ordering policies which are basic inventory policies, Material requirement planning (MRP) system and Just in time (JIT) approach. Three actual manufacturing supply chains were used as case studies to validate and demonstrate the flexibility of the model developed in this research. This model satisfactorily quantifies the bullwhip effect and the bullwhip effect levels identified in these case studies are significantly decreased by using the proposed simulation model. The successful results indicate that the model can be a useful alternative tool for supply chain managers to quantify and reduce the bullwhip effect in multi-product, multi-stage supply chains.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANFIS</field><field name="subject">Bullwhip Effect</field><field name="subject">System dynamics</field><field name="subject">Business logistics</field><field name="subject">Supply and demand</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust state estimation and model validation techniques in computer vision</field><field name="creator">Al-Takrouri, Saleh Othman Saleh, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to apply ideas and techniques from modern control theory, especially from robust state estimation and model validation, to various important problems in computer vision.  Robust model validation is used in texture recognition where new approaches for classifying texture samples and segmenting textured images are developed. Also, a new model validation approach to motion primitive recognition is demonstrated by considering the motion segmentation problem for a mobile wheeled robot.  A new approach to image inpainting based on robust state estimation is proposed where the implementation presented here concerns with recovering corrupted frames in video sequences. Another application addressed in this thesis based on robust state estimation is video-based tracking. A new tracking system is proposed to follow connected regions in video frames representing the objects in consideration. The system accommodates tracking multiple objects and is designed to be robust towards occlusions.  To demonstrate the performance of the proposed solutions, examples are provided where the developed methods are applied to various gray-scale images, colored images, gray-scale videos and colored videos.  In addition, a new algorithm is introduced for motion estimation via inverse polynomial interpolation. Motion estimation plays a primary role within the video-based tracking system proposed in this thesis. The proposed motion estimation algorithm is also applied to medical image sequences. Motion estimation results presented in this thesis include pairs of images from a echocardiography video and a robot-assisted surgery video.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer vision.</field><field name="subject">Robust state estimation.</field><field name="subject">Robust model validation.</field><field name="subject">Control theory .</field><field name="subject">Robust control .</field><field name="subject">Estimation theory .</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidative, inflammatory and vascular factors in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">Poljak, Anne, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In spite of impressive recent progress, the aetiopathogenesis of Alzheimer&#146;s disease (AD) remains incompletely understood. The distinctive neuropathological features of AD, in particular the plaques and tangles, have been the particular focus of most aetiological theories.  It is well accepted that AD is a multifactorial disease, with alterations to a variety of brain structures and cell types, including neurons, glia and the brain vasculature. Studies of risk factors have revealed a diversity of genetic variables that interact with health, diet and lifestyle-related factors in the causation of AD.  These factors influence the structure, aggregation and function of a set of proteins that are increasingly the focus of research.  The work in this thesis has focused on the pathophysiological aspects of some of these proteins in a number of cellular compartments and brain. Several assays have been established and techniques utilized in the completion of this work, including; differential detergent fractionation of brain tissue, 1D and 2D PAGE, western blotting with chemiluminescence detection, ELISA assays of Abeta 1-40 and 1-42, quantitative ECNI GCMS of o- and m-tyrosine as well as metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, quantitative MALDI-TOF assay of hemorphins and LCMSMS based proteomics, to identify proteins with altered expression levels in AD relative to control brain tissue. A variety of regional differences have been observed in the biochemistry of the AD cortex which are probably the outcome of local response variations to AD pathology. One of the most consistent threads throughout this work has been an apparent resilience of the occipital lobe relative to the other brain regions, as reflected in lower overall levels of oxidative stress and increased levels of proteins associated with metabolic processes, neuronal remodeling and stress reduction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oxidative Stress</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Vascular</field><field name="subject">Mass Spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="subject">Metabolomics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???The monsters next door???: representations of whiteness and monstrosity in contemporary culture</field><field name="creator">Tyrrell, Kimberley, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is the examination of whiteness as a dominant identity and subject position.  Whiteness has conventionally assumed a normative, monolithic status as the template of humanity.  Recent theorising has attempted to specify and denaturalise whiteness.  In order to participate in this fracturing of whiteness, I analyse examples in which it functions as a site of contested and ambiguous contradiction.  To this end, I use contemporary monstrosity to examine whiteness.  Monstrosity is a malleable and culturally specific category of difference that measures alterity, and by displaying discursive functions in an extreme form offers insight into the ways in which deviance and normativity operate.  I argue that the conjunction of whiteness and monstrosity, through displaying whiteness in a negative register, depicts some of the discursive operations that enable whiteness to attain such hegemonic dominance.  I deploy theories of marginalisation and subjectivation drawn from a variety of feminist, critical race, and philosophical perspectives in order to further an understanding of the discursive operations of hegemonic and normative subject positions. I offer a brief history and overview of both the history and prior conceptualisations of monstrosity and whiteness, and then focus on two particular examples of contemporary white monstrosity.  I closely examine the representation of monstrosity in serial killer films.  The figure of the serial killer is typically a white, heterosexual, middle class male whose monstrosity is implicitly reliant upon these elements.  In my discussion of the recent phenomenon of fatal shootings at high schools in North America, I investigate the way the massacre at Columbine High School functions as the public face of the phenomenon and for the unique interest it generated in the mass media.  I focus on a Time magazine cover that featured a photograph of the adolescent perpetrators under the heading The Monsters Next Door, which condensed and emblematised the tension that they generated.  It is through the perpetrators uneasy occupation of dual subject positions???namely the unassuming all American boy and the contemporary face of evil???that their simultaneous representation as average and alien undermines the notion of whiteness as neutral and invisible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monsters in literature.</field><field name="subject">Horror films -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Serial murderers.</field><field name="subject">whites.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interplay between sexual selection, inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="creator">Zajitschek, Susanne, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Inbreeding can have profound negative effects on individuals by reducing fertility and viability. In populations, inbreeding depression can reduce growth rates and increases extinction risk. The aims of this thesis are to investigate inbreeding depression in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and to study the evolution of mechanisms for inbreeding avoidance in females, using guppies from a feral population in Queensland, Australia. Male guppies are highly polymorphic in their sexual ornamentation, indeed they show one of the most extreme polymorphisms observed in nature. Female guppies exhibit complex mate choice based on preferences for ornamentation, as well as social context.  I aim is to examine how these factors of inbreeding avoidance alter sexual selection.   In male guppies I found strong inbreeding depression in male sperm numbers, which is amplified under semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Chapter 2). Moreover, inbreeding depression results in low fertility under sperm competition: an experiment using artificial insemination techniques reveals that highly inbred males are heavily disadvantaged in gaining paternity (Chapter 3). On population level, inbreeding depression is manifest in reduced growth rates, predominantly in the early stages of inbreeding (Chapter 4). Population growth at inbreeding coefficients f=0.375-0.59 did not seem to lead to inbreeding depression, whereas lower levels of inbreeding reduced population growth. Although the growth rates in inbred populations appear normal, severe inbreeding depression is uncovered after outbred immigrants are added.  Specifically, male immigrants are most efficient in short-term genetic rescue, probably due to insemination of large numbers of females whereas females are limited in the number of eggs they can produce (Chapter 4).  Male ornamental traits show significant inbreeding depression in semi-natural conditions only (Chapters 2 &amp; 3). Inbreeding avoidance mechanisms seem to have evolved in females: they prefer courtship displays of non-inbred males (Chapter 2), unfamiliar males (Chapter 5) and males with rare patterns (Chapter 6). This preference might increase the mating success of immigrants, and may have evolved to facilitate the avoidance of inbreeding. Together with context-independent preferences for ornament combinations (Chapter 6), it also offers an explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism in this species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guppy</field><field name="subject">sexual selection</field><field name="subject">inbreeding avoidance</field><field name="subject">Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="subject">mate choice</field><field name="subject">familiarity</field><field name="subject">female preference</field><field name="subject">inbreeding depression</field><field name="subject">sperm competition,</field><field name="subject">complex traits</field><field name="subject">selection analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The responses of C4 invasive grass Eragrostis curvula and C3 native grass Austrodanthonia Racemosa under elevated CO2 and water limitation</field><field name="creator">Hely, Sara Elizabeth Lorraine, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased by 35% since pre-industrial levels. Projections for the next 100 years indicate an increase to levels between 490 and 1260 parts per million by volume (ppm) of CO2, equating to a 75 % to 350 % increase in concentration since the year 1750. Associated with this increase in [CO2] will be a 1.4 to 5.8?? C increase in lower atmospheric temperature. While past research has attempted to address the effects of such climatic changes on individual plant responses, predictions of plant responses at the ecosystem level are still highly uncertain. Difficulties lie in the enormous variation of plant responses to climate change variables among and within species, and between and within environmental conditions. Past research assumed that plants using either the C3 or C4 metabolic pathways would respond differently but predictably to climate-change variables based on their metabolic pathway. Recent evidence has suggested however, that the added interactions of external environmental variables and species-specific sensitivities to climate change make it difficult to predict plant and ecosystem responses to climate change. To investigate the mechanisms behind responses of Australian grasses to climate change, 2 pot experiments was conducted using growth cabinets to compare the effect of elevated CO2 and water-limitation on the invasive C4 grassland plant, Eragrostis curvula (E. curvula), native Australian C3 grassland plant, Austrodanthonia racemosa (A. racemosa), and wheat species, Triticum aestivum (T. aestivum). The experiment was run at ambient levels of CO2 maintained at 390 ppm compared to elevated levels of 740 ppm. Imposed restrictions to water supply consisted of gradually drying the soil down to 30 % available soil water (ASW) followed by re-wetting to 50 % ASW.  Well-watered conditions for the experiment consisted of gradually drying the soil down to 50 % ASW, followed by rewetting to 95 % ASW. Plants were grown in mixtures and monocultures, consisting of 9 plants equally spaced in a grid design. The three significant findings of the thesis were that: 1)	the metabolic pathway (C3 versus C4) was not always an accurate predictor of biomass accumulation under elevated CO2 in the plants studied. Previous research suggested that CO2-stimulation of photosynthesis in C3 plants would lead to greater increases in biomass under elevated CO2 compared to C4 plants, though both C3 and C4 plants could benefit from any reduction in stomatal conductance under dry conditions at elevated CO2. The results from the experiments in this thesis showed a strongly significant biomass response to elevated CO2 in both dry and wet conditions for C4 grass E. curvula. The C3 grass A. racemosa in dry conditions, did not. It was speculated that without the CO2-induced water conservation effect, the C3 grass experienced photosynthetic down-regulation and this precluded a positive biomass response under elevated CO2. 2)	the magnitude and direction of biomass response to elevated CO2 was dependant on factors such as resource-availability and the phenotypic variability of the plants species. 3)	critical analysis of results from this thesis, combined with past research on plant responses under elevated CO2 showed a tendency for researchers to repeatedly test plants from the Poaceae family, or close relatives of the Poaceae family. As a result, when past data were corrected for this lack of independence, there was no relationship between the evolution of the C3 and C4 metabolic pathway and biomass response to elevated CO2. Instead, other factors (such as growth rate, plant height, leaf number, etc) were presented as being more important in determining biomass response. These observations were supported by results found in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water limitation</field><field name="subject">Elevated CO2</field><field name="subject">Australian Grasses</field><field name="subject">Competition</field><field name="subject">Weeds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimates and projections of HIV and Hepatitis C virus in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region</field><field name="creator">Razali, Karina, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of mathematical models in studying disease epidemics can be diverse, from the focused study of the role of a single determinant of the epidemic, or to the overall estimation of morbidity and mortality.  In using simple deterministic models, a balance is struck between biological and social complexities, and the high data input demands of mathematical models.  This thesis aims to apply the use of deterministic mathematical models to the studies of HIV and hepatitis C epidemiology in the Asia-Pacific region.  In Australia, about 85% of reported HIV cases are among homosexual men.  Casual homosexual partnerships made up 40% of incident HIV cases in 1995 increasing to 65% in 2004.  In the state of New South Wales, it was estimated that over 7,500 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005, increasing to over 10,000 by 2016 with existing levels of intervention.  Intervention measures were estimated to have prevented some 44,500 cases, the majority being among injecting drug users through the Needle and Syringe Programmes.  Models for the HIV epidemics in developing countries were also developed incorporating multiple routes of HIV transmission.  For Papua New Guinea, it was estimated 64,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005, rising to over 500,000 by 2025 with current levels of intervention.  High levels of interventions, in particular increased condom use, will be required to achieve a stabilisation or reduction in HIV prevalence.  In East Timor, the HIV epidemic is still in the early stages with 138 people estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS, rising to 5,000 by 2025 with minimal intervention.  For HCV, models of the epidemic in Australia showed HCV incidence peaking in 1999, followed by a decline reaching 9,700 incident cases in 2005.  Of 197,000 estimated chronic HCV cases in 2005, 58% had stage F 0/1 liver disease, 15% F 2/3 liver disease, and 2% HCV-related cirrhosis.  Models estimated 210 and 105 people developed HCV-related liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively.  Comparisons of modelled HCV long-term sequelae projections with linkage data showed relatively good agreement, despite discrepancies in liver-related deaths.  To decrease the number of chronic HCV, at least a tripling of treatment coverage would be required.  These models provide estimates of the current levels of epidemics as well as projections of future scenarios under different intervention strategies, which have an important role in the planning of strategies, as well as assessment of previous epidemic conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematical modelling.</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C Virus.</field><field name="subject">HIV (Viruses) -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">HIV (Viruses) -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remembering polishness: articulating and maintaining identity through turbulent times</field><field name="creator">Drozdzewski, Danielle, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis details the maintenance of Polish identities through acts of memory: the  (re)production, transmission and reception of Polish cultural practices.

Their performances are fluid: they move through time and across spaces.  The active maintenance of Polish identity developed as a result of foreign occupations.  The partitioning of Poland by the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian Empires lasted 123 years.  From 1795 to 1918 the Polish nation was expunged.  Following a brief period of independence between World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII), Poland was again occupied by Nazi and Soviet regimes during WWII (1939-1945).  The Soviet occupation continued after WWII with the Soviet-supported Polish government that lasted until 1989.  Under occupation ?? particularly during WWII ?? Poland suffered events that have been indelibly imprinted within Polish cultural memory.  The macabre nature of this era included the incursion of hegemonic regimes on political and everyday social life, as well as the atrocities for which it is well known.  An important outcome of these occupations has been the division of discourses of Polishness, and their remembrances, into distinctly public and private spheres.  These periods of foreign occupation brought various attempts to suppress and eliminate Polishness: the cultures and identifications of Polish people.  Suppression particularly occurred in public spheres through the prohibition of the Polish language, and by investing the public memory landscape with ideologies that represented the new regimes.  By repressing public commemorations of Polish cultural narratives, a new history was written at the expense of the Polish experience.  There have been two primary responses to these repressions of Polishness.  These responses initially developed during the partitioned period to ensure that Polish language and cultural practices were maintained.  First, a narrative and tradition of resistance emerged in reaction to the Russian, Prussian and Austrian partitions.  It was enacted through military participation in insurrections and through the production of patriotic Romantic Era cultural artefacts, both of which strengthened linkages to the Polish Catholic faith.  Second, Polish cultural practices and language were safeguarded in the private spheres of home.  It was in private settings, in Poland and within the diaspora in Australia, that memories and experiences of occupation were passed on and through generations.  In Poland, such narratives were often maintained in resistance to those imposed by foreign occupiers and because of the inability to commemorate events of Poland??s macabre past in public.  In Australia, identity maintenance has occurred to resist the dissolution of Polishness in a diasporic and multicultural environment.  This thesis demonstrates the utility of studying cultural memories as a means of understanding how identity maintenance can occur in the face of adversities, such as the multiple foreign occupations that occurred in Poland, and in diaspora.  Moreover, it exemplifies the diverse paths of identity maintenance in different contexts.  This thesis shows that despite the distinctive character of both Polish public and private spheres, Polish identities have been informed, shaped and maintained through culturally-enacted memory (re)production.  This process is exhibited in the present ?? in Poland and through the diaspora ?? and it occurred despite the repressive aims of various foreign occupiers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polishness</field><field name="subject">Cultural Memory</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Diaspora</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Polish -- Ethnic identity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory-based description of Australian franchising regulation</field><field name="creator">Moore, Gregory Allison, Business Law &amp; Taxation, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This paper examines franchising regulation in Australia as a case study for the analysis of regulation based on established regulatory theory. A literature review is conducted to establish and critique the theory of regulation based on the four main areas of established theory; regulatory purpose, regulatory strategies, rulemaking and enforcement. Case study data is drawn from primary source material and academic commentary on franchising regulation and presented according to the eras of franchising regulation in Australia, moving from the first proposals for legislation in the 1970s to the prescribed mandatory Franchising Code of Conduct model adopted in 1998 and refinements made to that scheme up to 2006. An analysis is then conducted on each major aspect of Australian franchising regulation using the established theoretical principles and analytical constructs available in the literature. The study concludes that the Franchising Code of Conduct regime, as a culmination of the experience gained and study undertaken in the preceding eras, is characterised by the availability of a broad range of enforcement options from harsh deterrence-oriented measures to more gentle and cooperative compliance-oriented options constituting an effective regulatory pyramid. The effectiveness of the regime is further bolstered by the presence of a credible regulatory strategy pyramid which emphasises the real possibility of escalated intervention, coupled with skilful deployment by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as enforcement agency. The principal weakness of the scheme is identified as unnecessarily ambiguous drafting in some areas, which compromises the quality of the otherwise highly transparent ruleset. It is suggested that the choice of regulatory strategy, often a focus of superficial examinations of regulation, is largely irrelevant to the nature of the regulation, with other features such as enforcement strategy, legitimacy, and availability of credible sanctions proving much more important. A proposal for an analytical framework based on the established theory is developed based on the experience of applying that theory to the case study. While this outlined framework assists in broadening focus across the entire regulatory regime to encourage assessment of the component parts, a lack of cohesion and linkage amongst the components highlights a shortcoming in the development of regulatory theory and an opportunity for further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code of Conduct</field><field name="subject">Regulation</field><field name="subject">Franchising</field><field name="subject">Franchises (Retail trade) -- Law and legislation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Trade regulation -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of mechanisms that impact trust: a domain study of online auctions</field><field name="creator">Bewsell, Glenn Robert, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated trust over the Internet to seek a better understanding of trust and ways to increase trust in online transactions. The focus of this investigation was consumer-to-consumer transactions at online auctions where key actors were virtually anonymous to each other. The perceptions of a broad range of online auction community members support this thesis. Normative and grounded theoretical perspectives of trust and factors that affected trust were considered, compared and contrasted as part of this research. Concept mapping and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) were used to underpin the grounded theoretical perspective of trust developed as part of this thesis. Online auction cases were selected and analysed to check the grounded theoretical perspective of trust developed. This thesis provided a better understanding of trust, provided new insights into trust and distrust, added to the body of theory for trust and identified ways to increase trust in online transactions. This thesis provided better understandings of: trust; moral obligations; network decision structures; power; fairness; and perceived behavioural controls at online auctions. A grounded theoretical model of trust based in TPB was developed that was specific to online auctions. This model of trust developed appeared to provide clearer and richer insights into online auction trust. The model of trust developed identified factors and constructs that affected trust rather than the magnitude of any affects. The model developed and findings of this thesis can be applied to new or specific online auction sites to help practitioners build better online environments to encourage more people to transact rather than just browse online. The grounded theoretical perspective of trust and findings of this thesis may be relevant to other online consumer-to-consumer transactional environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online trust</field><field name="subject">Auctions</field><field name="subject">Online auctions</field><field name="subject">eTrust</field><field name="subject">eBusiness</field><field name="subject">eCommerce</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"More than a liver" - the role of the social work practitioner in hepatitis C treatment centres</field><field name="creator">Mouton, Marlize, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hepatitis C is a fast growing infectious disease in Australia and is often associated with related psycho-social and mental health problems.  The conventional treatment process for hepatitis C is challenging due to a number of reasons.  This study explored social workers&#146; perceptions of the contribution of their role in hepatitis C treatment centres in relation to the treatment experience of patients.  The roles that social workers fulfill, their contribution to the multidisciplinary team and towards a culturally competent service, were explored.  Furthermore the knowledge, skills and values required for providing a competent service in a hepatitis C treatment setting was explored.  The broad theoretical frameworks that inform social work practice were considered, especially the biopsycho-social model, the strengths perspective, the critically reflexive approach and communications theory.  This qualitative study used a semi-structured interview method for data collection.  Ten social workers in hepatitis C treatment clinics participated in the study.  The findings highlight the needs of patients and how social worker participants described helping to address and meet these needs by employing their knowledge, skills and values through their social work roles and interventions in a team context in a multicultural and multi-faceted work environment.  A major challenge that social workers described was to keep patients on treatment despite debilitating side effects that diminish patients' motivation to complete treatment.  A shortcoming in the service was described to be the limited psychiatric support available at many treatment centres.  The findings lead to a number of recommendations to improve social work services in hepatitis C treatment settings.  More research was recommended in areas such as motivational techniques, psychiatric support, and effective group work strategies.  The need for increased funding for social work positions in the hepatitis C field was also highlighted.  It is anticipated that findings of this study can be applied to hepatitis C treatment in broader settings such as prisons, drug and alcohol settings and general practice.  This research will contribute to literature in the field of hepatitis C treatment models and in the field of social work practice in hepatitis C contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interferon treatment compliance</field><field name="subject">Social Work</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Treatment -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Multi disciplinary team</field><field name="subject">Chronic illness</field><field name="subject">Psycho social assessments</field><field name="subject">Social workers</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Patients</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of heterocyclic analogues of phytoestrogens</field><field name="creator">Leu, Chao-Wei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-6-one ring system was synthesised from 3-aryl-4,6-dimethoxyindoles and 2,3-disubstituted-4,6-dimethoxyindoles. The reaction of 4,6-dimethoxyindoles under Friedel-Crafts or Vilsmeier-Haack acylation gave the 2- and 7-indolyldeoxybenzoins in good yield. Cyclisation of 7-indolyldeoxybenzoins with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal as a one carbon reagent gave the pyrroloquinolin-6-ones in high yield. Reduction of pyrroloquinolin-6-ones with hydrogen gas and 10% palladium on carbon or lithium aluminium hydride yielded the dihydropyrroloquinolin-6-ones. Demethylation of pyrroloquinolin-6-ones with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid gave a mixture of the monohydroxy and dihydroxy analogues in high yield. The synthesis of quinolin-4-ones using the Conrad-Limpach method was attempted using three different cyclisation conditions such as Dowtherm A, polyphosphoric acid and a mixture of diphenyl ether and methanesulfonic acid. Quinolin-2-ones such as 4-methyl-3-aryl-, 3,4-diaryl- and 3-aryl-4-benzyl-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones could be synthesised from either the N-phenylacetylaniline or the N-trifluoroacetyl aniline strategy. Attempted reduction of the quinolin-2-ones with standard metal hydride reagents was unsuccessful. However reduction was achieved via the conversion of quinolin-2-one to the corresponding 2-chloroquinoline followed by reaction of the chloroquinoline with zinc powder and glacial acetic acid to produce a novel, highly substituted quinoline system. Demethylation was successfully carried out with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid to give the trihydroxyquinolin-2-one in high yield. The reactions of 4-substituted-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones and the corresponding 2-chloroquinolines as potential organic intermediates were explored. Facile formylation of both quinolin-2-ones and 2-chloroquinolines was observed under Vilsmeier-Haack conditions while acetylation was successful under Friedel-Crafts conditions using antimony (V) pentachloride as the Lewis acid. Further reaction of 8-formyl-quinolin-2-one with 1,2-diaminobenzene in N,N-dimethylformamide led to the formation of a new 8-(benzimidazolyl)-quinolin-2-one ring system. The quinolin-2-ones exhibited selective electrophilic substitution at the C8 position for a range of reactions. However, an unexpected nitration occurred at the C3 position for the 4-methoxy and 4-phenyl-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones with good yields. A series of novel 4,6-hydroxylindoles was successfully synthesised from the corresponding methoxy analogues in high yield using anhydrous aluminium chloride. When 3-(4-bromophenyl)-4,6-dimethoxyindole was reacted with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid a 2,2?-indolylindoline dimer was formed. The 5,7-dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones were similarly synthesised in high yield using anhydrous aluminium chloride in chlorobenzene.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytoestrogens</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">System modelling of the compact linear Fresnel reflector</field><field name="creator">Pye, John Downing, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector is a solar thermal energy system currently at prototype stage in Australia. The system uses parallel rows of mirrors lined up underneath a long, elevated thermal absorber. The mirrors move so as to focus solar radiation onto the absorber; the absorber contains a bank of high-pressure water pipes through which water is pumped and gradually boils. The process of ??direct steam generation?? in very long pipes, up to 300 m in a straight run, has not previously been performed at this scale; other systems use shorter pipe runs, or use other fluids such as non-boiling oil. This thesis addresses a broad range of design issues relating to the CLFR prototype and its components. Beam solar radiation at the prototype site is estimated from available data including satellite-derived and ground-based measurements. Existing correlations for the beam component of global radiation do not apply well to Australian conditions so a new correlation is proposed.  Computational fluid dynamics simulations establish radiative heat-loss as the dominant mode for the thermal absorber. Results are gathered for a range of sizes and shapes, and heat-loss correlations are derived for use in subsequent simulation.  Two-phase flow in the absorber direct-steam-generation process is examined, and a detailed model including, pipe-friction pressure drops, flow-boiling heat transfer and cavity heat loss is presented, with validation against the experimental results of other workers. A series of ??performance maps?? give the predicted outlet flow regime for varied inlet conditions, allowing selection of desired operating points.  A full system model is given that integrates this absorber model with ancillary components including the pump and connecting pipework; the model is used to evaluate pumping requirements and to establish expected operating conditions. The inherent pressure instability arising from the two phase flow is examined and orifice plates are sizes to stabilise this effect.  A dynamic model for the absorber pipe flow using fully implicit finite difference techniques and accurate IAPWS-IF97 steam properties gives the predicted behaviour during solar transients at both long and short time-scales.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermal</field><field name="subject">energy</field><field name="subject">solar</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Helping jurors to evaluate eyewitness identifications: the role of expert evidence and judicial instruction</field><field name="creator">Martire, Kristy Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Psychologists, legal practitioners and scholars share the knowledge that honest eyewitnesses can err in their attempts to identify the perpetrator of a crime. This thesis reports an experimental investigation of the extent to which expert evidence and judicial instruction can improve juror ability to discriminate between accurate and inaccurate identifications. Special attention is also paid to the logic of inferences which have been made by psychologists regarding the efficacy of expert evidence, and compares methodologies adopting direct measures of participant Sensitivity to Eyewitness Accuracy (SEA) with those that can only indirectly assess this construct. Study 1 surveys the knowledge and opinions of legal professionals regarding eyewitness identification issues (n = 35), showing that respondents expressed doubts that judicial instructions would exert an effect equivalent to that of eyewitness expert evidence. Accordingly, Experiments 1 to 4 (Experiment 1, n = 104; Experiment 2, n = 238; Experiment 3, n = 228; Experiment 4, n = 297) were conducted to directly assess the relative impacts of judicial instruction and expert evidence on participant juror SEA. The methodology utilised in these investigations incorporated the testimony of real eyewitnesses to a staged crime scenario in order to assess the impact of instruction on juror ability to discriminate between known accurate and known inaccurate eyewitnesses. Overall, little evidence was found to support the notion that expert evidence is more effective than judicial instruction, as no significant association was identified between instruction type and SEA. This result was found to hold irrespective of the objective quality of the expert?s testimony (accurate or erroneous). In light of the results from Experiments 1 to 4, Experiment 5 was designed to investigate why the experts were not able to improve the discrimination accuracy of the jurors. This study focused on the extent to which participants of varying levels of expertise could correctly classify eyewitness accuracy. The results of Experiment 5 (n = 145) suggest that experts were no better able to discriminate between accurate and inaccurate eyewitnesses than novice laypeople. Overall, the evidence reported in this thesis raises serious questions regarding the utility of eyewitness expertise in the completion of eyewitness discrimination tasks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Judicical Instruction</field><field name="subject">Eyewitness</field><field name="subject">Expert Testimony</field><field name="subject">Jurors</field><field name="subject">Eyewitness identification</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectral analysis of arterial blood prssure and stroke volume variability: the role of Calcium channel blockers and sensitizers</field><field name="creator">Alomari, Abdul-Hakeem Hussein, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we included results from two studies. The first one considered the effects of the blood volume changes, during blood donation, on the heart rate variability (HRV) measured, non-invasively, form electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals. Our results showed that, during blood donation, there were no significant changes in the pulsatile area of PPG signal, while heart rate increased. No significant changes were noticed in HRV extracted from both signals. Error analysis between the HRV extracted from ECG and peak interval variability (PIV) suggested that the error during blood donation was increased which means that the use of PIV extracted from PPG signal, used as a replacement diagnostic tool in clinical applications, needs further investigations and should be carefully studied in non-stationary cardiovascular situations such as blood donation.  The imbalance between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic, vagal, may result in a harmful activation of myocardial tissues which cause arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Although the study of the sympathovagal balance have been attracting many researchers, further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of many kinds of drugs on the autonomic modulation of the cardiac muscle, specifically, the cells of sinoatrial (SA) node. The aim of the second part of this thesis was to assess the effects of calcium channel blocker (Verapamil), calcium channel sensitizer (Levosimendan), calcium chloride (CaCl2), the combinations of verapamil/ CaCl2, levosimendan/ CaCl2, and noradrenaline infusion on beat-to-beat cardiovascular variability represented, in this research, by systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV), and stroke volume variability (SVV) signals. We used Fat Fourier Transform (FFT) to evaluate the power spectral density of the fluctuations in both signals to evaluate the effects of short-term treatments with those drugs on the sympathovagal balance in normal rats. Then, we compared the spectra obtained from SBPV and SVV to decide which of these fluctuations along with corresponding spectrum was more able to provide a clear feedback about the autonomic nervous system. Our data suggests that there were a significant correlations between low- (LF), mid- (MF), and high-frequency (HF) spectra obtained from SBPV and SVV except between the HF spectra estimated from after the infusion of levosimendan where a poor correlation (r = 0.530, p = 0.281) was noticed. This that both HF components obtained provide different information regarding the autonomic nervous system modulation of the SA node cells, while the results obtained from the rest of experiments showed that both signals provide same information about the modulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone due to all stages of different drugs infusion studied in this thesis. Besides that, we found that both spectra may be used to track the fluctuations in the cardiac output as a result of the drugs infusion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Levosimendan.</field><field name="subject">Photoplethysmographic signal.</field><field name="subject">Stroke volume variability.</field><field name="subject">Calcium channel sensitizers.</field><field name="subject">Levosimendan.</field><field name="subject">Stroke volume variability.</field><field name="subject">Blood pressure variability.</field><field name="subject">Spectral analysis.</field><field name="subject">Sympathovagal balance.</field><field name="subject">Blood volume.</field><field name="subject">Calcium.</field><field name="subject">Verapamil.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of footwear on balance and gait in older people</field><field name="creator">Menant, Jasmine Charlotte Christiane, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although footwear has been recognised as a risk factor for falls in older people, it remains unclear as to which features of shoes are beneficial or detrimental to balance. This project aimed to systematically investigate the effects of common shoe features, namely: an elevated heel, a soft sole, a hard sole, a flared sole, a bevelled heel, a high-collar and a tread sole, on balance and gait in older community-dwelling people. The experimental shoes were compared to standard shoes in three studies examining: (i) standing balance, leaning balance and stepping in 29 older people, (ii) centre of mass (COM)-base of support (BOS) margins, vertical and braking loading rates, and perceived shoe comfort and stability in 11 young and 15 older people walking on even and uneven surfaces, and (iii) temporal-spatial gait variables, pelvis acceleration, and gait termination in 10 young and 26 older people, on level, irregular and wet surfaces. Elevated heel shoes impaired overall performance in functional tests of balance and stepping. They were also perceived as lacking comfort and stability and led to a conservative walking pattern characterised by increased step width and double-support time, reduced braking and vertical loading rates and medio-lateral (ML) pelvis accelerations on various surfaces. Soft sole shoes increased lateral COM-BOS margin and step width, indicating reduced ML walking stability. When wearing these shoes, subjects had longer total stopping times and on the wet surface, smaller step lengths and shoe/floor angles at heel strike, suggesting a potential risk of slipping. When wearing high-collar shoes, subjects had better balance as demonstrated by small but significant increases in lateral COM-BOS margin, double-support time and step width, and decreases in ML pelvis accelerations on varying surfaces and in total stopping time on the wet surface. Shoes with hard, flared or tread soles or a bevelled heel did not affect balance. In conclusion, providing that they are fitted, have adequate fastening and perhaps a slip-resistant sole, shoes with a low square heel, a sole of medium hardness (shore A-40) and a high-collar provide the greatest stability for older people when walking on dry, wet and irregular surfaces.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Footwear</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="subject">Balance</field><field name="subject">Falls</field><field name="subject">Gait disorders in old age</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informal  and formal caring strategies of female carers in two CALD communities</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Annette Kathy, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study, completed in 2008, aims to address gaps in the literature on caring concerning the reluctance of CALD communities in Australia to use formal care. It hypothesises that broader cultural considerations, rather than merely language barriers and lack of information, are responsible for the preference of CALD communities for informal care. The literature on caring, mediated by certain aspects of Bourdieu??s habitus, is employed as a conceptual framework to analyse the informal and formal strategies employed by carers from the Italian and Greek speaking communities. The study concludes that habitus, informed by cultural factors, influences both the means of access to formal care and the type of formal care acceptable to these communities but differs between communities and between generations within each community.

The latter dominate especially for RO, NF and UF and are the focus of this study. The main difficulty these types of modules face is concentration polarisation. In SWM modules, the spacer meshes that keep the membrane leaves apart also help reduce the effects of concentration polarisation. The spacer filaments act as flow obstructions, and thus encourage flow destabilisation and increase mass transfer enhancement. One of the detrimental aspects of the use of spacers is an increase of pressure losses in SWM modules. This study analyses the mechanisms that give rise to mass transfer enhancement in narrow spacer-filled channels, and investigates the relationship between flow destabilisation, energy losses and mass transfer. It shows that the regions of high mass transfer on the membrane surface correlate mainly with those regions where the fluid flow is towards the membrane. Based on the insights gained from this analysis, a series of multi-layer spacer designs are proposed and evaluated. In this thesis, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to simulate steady and unsteady flows with mass transfer in two- and three-dimensional narrow channels containing spacers. A solute with a Schmidt number of 600 dissolving from the wall and channel Reynolds numbers up to 1683 were considered. A fully-developed concentration profile boundary condition was utilised in order to reduce the computational costs of the simulations. Time averaging and Fourier analysis were performed to gain insight into the dynamics of the different flow regimes encountered, ranging from steady flow to vortex shedding behind the spacer filaments. The relationships between 3D flow effects, vortical flow, pressure drop and mass transfer enhancement were explored. Greater mass transfer enhancement was found for the 3D geometries modelled, when compared with 2D geometries, due to wall shear perpendicular to the bulk flow and streamwise vortices. Form drag was identified as the main component of energy loss for the flow conditions analysed. Implications for the design of improved spacer meshes, such as extra layers of spacer filaments to direct the bulk flow towards the membrane walls, and filament profiles to reduce form drag are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spiral Wound Module</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">Membrane</field><field name="subject">Spacer</field><field name="subject">Mass transfer -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics -- Computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circulating neutrophil activation and recruitment during the systemic inflammatory response to cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation</field><field name="creator">Orr, Yishay, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Circulating neutrophil activation occurs during cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and is implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory tissue injury and peri-operative organ dysfunction. However, neutrophil directed antiinflammatory strategies have failed to demonstrate consistent therapeutic benefit indicating that the nature and significance of peri-operative circulating neutrophil activation remains incompletely defined. In particular, conformational activation of the b2 integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), which is required for neutrophil adhesion competence and facilitation of effector functions, has not previously been investigated during cardiac surgery, and the relative contribution of cellular activation and bone marrow neutrophil recruitment to peri-operative changes in circulating neutrophil phenotype and function is unknown. A novel whole blood flow cytometric technique was used to analyze circulating neutrophil phenotype (total Mac-1, conformationally-active CD11b, CD10, CD16, L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) and function in cardiac surgery patients to characterize the nature of changes in Mac-1 expression and activation status, and the effects of relative neutrophil immaturity on circulating neutrophil phenotype and function. The effect of heparin, a known CD11b ligand, on Mac-1 epitope expression was also investigated. Circulating neutrophil numbers observed during ECC were mathematically modeled to determine the acute response of the bone marrow neutrophil reserve to an inflammatory stimulus. Plasma cytokine, chemokine and acute phase mediators were measured in cardiac and lung surgery patients to determine potential regulators of systemic neutrophil recruitment. Neutrophils newlyemergent from the bone marrow were characterized as CD10-/CD16low and exhibited distinct changes in cell surface markers and enhanced functional responses, relative to their more mature CD10+ counterparts. Conformational activation of CD11b occurred peri-operatively and provided a more sensitive measure of circulating neutrophil activation status than changes in total Mac-1 or L-selectin expression, although detection of Mac-1 epitopes was reduced in the presence of heparin. Modeling of circulating neutrophil numbers predicted that post-mitotic maturation time was acutely abbreviated by 8.4 hours during 71 minutes of ECC. Systemic chemokine release occurred with cardiac but not non-cardiac thoracic surgery indicating some specificity of the acute inflammatory response. These findings expand the understanding of peri-operative circulating neutrophil activation and recruitment, and identify potential therapeutic targets to limit neutrophil injurious potential during cardiac surgery with ECC.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrins</field><field name="subject">Neutrophils</field><field name="subject">Extracorporeal circulation</field><field name="subject">Bone marrow</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel antagonists of bacterial signaling pathways</field><field name="creator">Goh, Wai Kean, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Traditional bacterial disease therapies utilize compounds that ultimately kill the target bacteria but it exerts a strong selective pressure on the bacteria to develop multi-drug resistance mutants. The increasing occurrence of resistance in common pathogens has highlighted the need to identify new anti-microbials that target the control of bacterial pathogenicity in a non-extermination manner to reduce the incidence of bacteria resistance. One new strategy exploits the discrete signaling molecules that regulate the various bacterial signaling pathways, which are responsible for the expression of pathogenicity traits. Halogenated furanones (fimbrolides) from the marine red alga, Delisea pulchra have been shown to interfere with the key signaling pathway present in Gram-negative bacteria by competitively displacing the cognate signaling molecule from the transcription protein. This project focused on the design and synthesis of 1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ones, a new class of fimbrolide derivatives capable of displaying strong antagonistic properties of the fimbrolides. Primary synthetic methodologies examined include the halolactamization of allenamides and the direct lactone-lactam transformation. No doubt, both methodologies yielded the lactam ring, the former failed to introduce the crucial C-5 bromomethylene group essential for bioactivity. A facile high yielding two-step lactone-lactam transformation method was developed and using this method, a wide range of substituted 5-bromomethyl- and 5-dibromomethylene-1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ones were synthesized. Furthermore, a new class of tricyclic crown-ether type compounds with no literature precedent were discovered.  To vary the diversity of the compounds, a related class of compounds, 5,6-dihydroindol-2-ones, were examined.  A general versatile method for the synthesis of 7-substituted 5,6-dihydroindol-2-ones was developed. The synthetic strategy proceeds via the established Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of halogenated dihydroindol-2-ones with arylboronic acids/esters. The Suzuki methodology was found to be reliable in furnishing a wide range of 7-substituted products in high yields. A preliminary molecular modeling approach was used to assist in the design of new anti-microbials via the ligand-docking analyses of the TraR and LasR protein. A positive correlation was observed between the docking scores and biological activity and the methodology was further developed into an initial screening tool to filter potential active and non-active compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were analysed for their efficacy in reducing the expression of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in the presence of natural AHL signaling molecules in an AHL-monitor strain, indicative of the inhibition of bacterial phenotype expression. The dihydropyrrol-2-one class of compounds showed significant biological activity and this highlighted their potential for further development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dihydroindolone</field><field name="subject">Quorum Sensing</field><field name="subject">Dihydropyrrolone</field><field name="subject">Molecular Modeling</field><field name="subject">AHL Receptor Binding</field><field name="subject">TraR</field><field name="subject">LasR</field><field name="subject">Antibacterial agents</field><field name="subject">Chemical inhibitors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbothermal solid state reduction of manganese oxide and ores in different gas atmospheres</field><field name="creator">Kononov, Ring, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of the project was to establish rate and mechanisms of solid state reduction of manganese ores. The project studied carbothermal reduction of manganese oxide MnO, two Groote Eylandt (Australian) and Wessels (South African) manganese ores in hydrogen, helium and argon atmospheres at temperatures up to 1400C for MnO and 1200C for manganese ores. Experiments were conducted in the fixed bed reactor with on-line off-gas analysis. The major findings are as follows. ??	Rate and degree of reduction of MnO and ores increased with increasing temperature. ??	Reduction of MnO and manganese ores at temperatures up to 1200C was faster in helium than in argon, and much faster in hydrogen than in helium. The difference in MnO reduction in hydrogen and helium decreased with increasing temperature to 1400C. ??	Addition of up to 7 vol% of carbon monoxide to hydrogen had no effect on MnO reduction at 1200C. ??	In the process of carbothermal reduction of ores in hydrogen at 1200C, silica was reduced. ??	Reduction of both GE ores was slower than of Wessels ore. This was attributed to high content of iron oxide in the Wessels ore. ??	Carbon content in the graphite-ore mixture had a strong effect on phases formed in the process of reduction; thus, in the reduction of Wessels ore with 12-16 wt% C, a-Mn and Mn23C6 were formed; when carbon content was above 20 wt%, oxides were reduced to carbide (Mn,Fe)7C3. ??	Kinetic analysis showed that mass transfer of intermediate CO2 from oxide to graphite in carbothermal reduction in inert atmosphere was a contributing factor in the rate control. ??	High rate of reduction of manganese oxide in hydrogen was attributed to formation of methane which facilitated mass transfer of carbon from graphite to oxide. Hydrogen was also directly involved in reduction of manganese ore reducing iron oxides to metallic iron and higher manganese oxides to MnO. Reduction of Wessels and Groote Eyland Premium Fines ores in the solid state is feasible at temperatures up to 1200C; while temperature for solid state reduction of Groote Eyland Premium Sands is limited by 1100C.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">manganese oxide</field><field name="subject">carbothermal solid state reduction</field><field name="subject">carbothermal reduction</field><field name="subject">Groote Eylandt</field><field name="subject">Wessels</field><field name="subject">manganese ore</field><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">helium</field><field name="subject">argon</field><field name="subject">manganese carbide</field><field name="subject">manganese iron silicon carbides</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial reuse in TDMA wireless networks</field><field name="creator">Oh, Inhee, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we investigate the performance of spatial reuse in wireless networks. More specifically, we investigate the performance of location-based spatial reuse built upon the identification of links in the network that form Collision-Free Sets (CFSs). We develop algorithms that efficiently find such CFSs. The main focus of this thesis is the application of our CFS-based algorithms to emerging WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) networks. However, we will also apply our CFS-based algorithms to smaller scale networks, as well as to the issue of QoS routing. This thesis makes several contributions. We first show how CFSs can be found within polynomial time in small scale wireless networks. We then probe how CFSs can be used to enhance network efficiency when location is available. We also explore how CFS determination is affected by location error, determining what level of location error renders the use of CFSs ineffective. In this context, we discuss the density of access points required to ensure CFS-based spatial reuse remains effective. We then focus on the use of CFSs in emerging multihop WiMAX networks, showing in detail how enhanced spatial reuse is delivered. The spatial reuse gains are probed both in the presence of realistic channel conditions and realistic location errors. Within the context of the IEEE 802.16 standard we show how CFSs can enhance, by factors of two, the VoIP capacity of multihop WiMAX networks. We also discuss how our CFS algorithms can be applied to other ongoing efforts aimed at improving VoIP capacity in WiMAX networks. Finally, an application of our CFS algorithms in the context of QoS routing is studied. Specifically, we develop a two-hop QoS routing protocol that guarantees QoS specifications by securing higher bandwidth for the chosen routes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">WiMAX</field><field name="subject">Spatial Reuse</field><field name="subject">STDMA</field><field name="subject">Spatial systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for transiting extrasolar planets from the southern hemisphere</field><field name="creator">Hamacher, Duane Willis, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">To date, more than 300 planets orbiting stars other than our sun have been discovered using a range of observing techniques, with new discoveries occuring monthly. The work in this thesis focused on the detection of exoplanets using the transit method. Planets orbiting close to their host stars have a roughly 10 per cent chance of eclipsing (transiting) the star, with Jupiter?sized planets causing a one per cent dip in the flux of the star over a few hours. A wealth of orbital and physical information on the system can be extracted from these systems, including the planet density which is essential in constraining models of planetary formation. To detect these types of planets requires monitoring tens of thousands of stars over a period of months. To accomplish this, we conduct a wide-field survey using the 0.5-meter Automated Patrol Telescope (APT) at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) in NSW, Australia. Once candidates were selected from the data?set, selection criteria were applied to separate the likely planet candidates from the false?positives. For this thesis, the methods and instrumentation used in attaining data and selecting planet candidates are discussed, as well as the results and analysis of the planet candidates selected from star fields observed from 2004?2007. Of the 65 planet candidates initially selected from the 25 target fields observed, only two were consistent with a planet transit. These candidates were later determined to be eclipsing binary stars based on follow up observations using the 40-inch telescope, 2.3-m telescope, and the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope, all located at SSO. Additionally, two planet candidates from the SuperWASP-North consortium were observed on the 40-inch telescope. Both proved to be eclipsing binary stars. While no planets were found, our search methods and results are consistent with successful transit surveys targeting similar fields with stars in a similar magnitude range and using similar methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transit method</field><field name="subject">extrasolar planets</field><field name="subject">exoplanets</field><field name="subject">observational astronomy</field><field name="subject">automated patrol telescope</field><field name="subject">Extrasolar planets</field><field name="subject">Southern Hemisphere</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on testing some predictions of RBC models and the stationarity of real interest rates</field><field name="creator">Ji, Inyeob, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains a series of essays that provide empirical evidence for Australia on some fundamental predictions of real business cycle models and on the convergence and persistence of real interest rates. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the issues examined in each chapter and provides an overview of the methodologies that are used. Tests of various basic predictions of standard real business cycle models for Australia are presented in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. Chapter 2 considers the question of great ratios for Australia. These are ratios of macroeconomic variables that are predicted by standard models to be stationary in the steady state. Using time series econometric techniques (unit root tests and cointegration tests) Australia great ratios are examined. In Chapter 3 a more restrictive implication of real business cycle models than the existence of great ratios is considered.  Following the methodology proposed by Canova, Finn and Pagan (1994) the equilibrium decision rules for some standard real business cycle are tested on Australian data. The final essay on this topic is presented in Chapter 4.  In this chapter a large-country, small-country is used to try and understand the reason for the sharp rise in Australia??s share of world output that began around 1990.  Chapter 5 discusses real interest rate linkages in the Pacific Basin region. Vector autoregressive models and bootstrap methods are adopted to study financial linkages between East Asian markets, Japan and US. Given the apparent non-stationarity of real interest rates a related issue is examined in Chapter 6, viz. the persistence of international real interest rates and estimation of their half-life. Half-life is selected as a means of measuring persistence of real rates. Bootstrap methods are employed to overcome small sample issues in the estimation and a non-standard statistical inference methodology (Highest Density Regions) is adopted. Chapter 7 reapplies the High Density Regions methodology and bootstrap half-life estimation to the data used in Chapters 2 and 5. This provides a robustness check on the results of standard unit root tests that were applied to the data in those chapters.    Main findings of the thesis are as follows. The long run implications of real business cycle models are largely rejected by the Australia data. This finding holds for both the existence of great ratios and when the explicit decision rules are employed. When the small open economy features of the Australian economy are incorporated in a two country RBC model, a country-specific productivity boom seems to provide a possible explanation for the rise in Australia??s share of world output. The essays that examine real interest rates suggest the following results. Following the East Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 there appears to have been a decline in the importance of Japan in influencing developments in the Pacific Basin region. In addition there is evidence that following the crisis Korea??s financial market became less insular and more integrated with the US. Finally results obtained from the half-life estimators suggest that despite the usual findings from unit root tests, real interest rates may in fact exhibit mean-reversion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Real interest rate</field><field name="subject">RBC</field><field name="subject">Small open economy</field><field name="subject">Interest rates -- Australia -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Macroeconomics -- Econometric models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unobtrusive monitoring of health status of elderly people living alone at home</field><field name="creator">Kaushik, Alka Rani, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the hypothesis that unobtrusive monitoring of daily living could be used to evaluate changes in the health status of frail elderly people living alone at home. Low cost motion sensors can be used for monitoring the long term trends in occupant?s well-being in terms of physical, mental, social and environmental factors. The monitored data can be used to quantitatively measure parameters that can provide insight into the level of activity and functional ability of the subject.  Any deviations in these parameters can provide information on the changing health status of the subject.  This thesis attempts for the first time to establish a mathematical and statistical framework for the monitoring of functional health status in the home using a network of wireless sensors to monitor occupancy in each room of the house. A low power and low cost, unobtrusive occupancy monitoring system using ZigBee wireless technology and passive infrared sensors has been developed by the Biomedical Systems Laboratory at the University of New South Wales. The essence of the occupancy monitoring system is to detect variations in the activities of daily living (ADL) of elderly people living alone at home.  The finite state, discrete parameter, time homogeneous Markov chain represents a theoretical framework for an unobtrusive occupancy monitoring system. An implementation of this framework for monitoring occupancy pattern is presented in real time use. The system was evaluated in a series of field studies in laboratory and home environment, in supervised and unsupervised settings, using cohorts of healthy elderly subjects living alone in their homes in community dwelling setting. A pilot trial was conducted in which four healthy elderly subjects living alone had PIR motion sensors installed in their homes at strategic points for a period of up to 13 weeks. The functionality of the system was evaluated over a domain of basic daily activities. A profile of the activities, in real time environment, for different times and days was stored as transition probability matrices. Automatic techniques for interpreting the test data captured by the system in terms of human movements were evaluated and compared with the wellness profile of the subject. Trial results exhibited that clinically significant model parameters were able to detect longitudinal deviations in the functional health status of elderly people.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monitoring Health Status.</field><field name="subject">Older people.</field><field name="subject">Detectors.</field><field name="subject">Health.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in beta-cell lipoapoptosis</field><field name="creator">Preston, Amanda Miriam, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Beta-cell failure is a key step in the progression from metabolic disorder to overt type 2 diabetes (T2D). This failure is characterised by both secretory defects and loss of beta-cell mass, the latter most likely through increases in the rate of apoptosis. Although the mechanisms underlying these beta-cell defects are unclear, evidence suggests that chronic exposure of beta-cells to elevated fatty acid (FA) plays a role in disease development in genetically susceptible individuals. Furthermore, it has been postulated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signalling pathways (the unfolded protein response; UPR) play a role in FA-induced beta-cell dysfunction. The broad aim of this thesis was to explore the nature of these relationships.  Experiments detailed in this thesis demonstrate that MIN6 beta-cells mount a comprehensive ER stress response with exposure to elevated saturated fatty acid palmitate, but not the unsaturated fatty acid, oleate, within the low elevated physiological range. This response was time-dependent and involved both transcriptional and translational changes in UPR transducers and targets. The differential activation of ER stress in MIN6 beta-cells by saturated, but not unsaturated FA species may represent a mechanism of differential beta-cell death described in many studies with these FA. Furthermore, these experiments describe defects in ER to Golgi trafficking with chronic palmitate treatment, but not oleate or thapsigagin treatment, identifying this as a potential mechanism by which palmitate treatment induces ER stress. Moreover, these studies have shown the relevance to ER stress to a whole body model of T2D by demonstrating UPR activation in the islets of the db/db mouse. In conclusion, studies detailed in this thesis have demonstrated that ER stress occurs in in vitro and in vivo models of beta-cell lipotoxicity and apoptosis. In addition, these studies have identified defects in ER to Golgi trafficking as a mechanism by which palmitate treatment induces ER stress. These studies highlight the importance of ER stress in the development of T2D.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fatty acid</field><field name="subject">Endoplasmic reticulum stress</field><field name="subject">Type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">Pancreatic beta-cell</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opioid dependence: associations with suicidal behaviour and other psychiatric comorbidity</field><field name="creator">Maloney, Elizabeth Ann, National Drug &amp; Alcohol Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Suicide attempts and opioid dependence are important clinical issues, as both are associated with a high degree of psychiatric morbidity and elevated risk of mortality. Research has identified a number of risk factors for suicide attempts among the general population, and to a lesser extent, among heroin users. Due to a lack of case-control studies, however, it is still not known to what extent opioid dependence per se is a risk factor for suicide attempts. This thesis comprised the first study to directly examine whether opioid dependence is a unique risk factor of suicide attempts. This thesis examined suicide attempts, associated risk factors, and related comorbidity among an opioid-dependent case group and a non-opioid-dependent control group. A structured interview was used to collect data from 726 opioid-dependent cases and 399 non-opioid-dependent controls. This thesis identified a number of important findings. Firstly, although opioid-dependent individuals were more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts compared to controls, the risk factors were largely the same for both groups. It appeared that opioid-dependent individuals were characterised by a higher likelihood of the same risk factors for suicide attempts, rather than having different risks. Cases appeared to be at increased risk of suicide attempts because of increased levels of multiple risk factors. Secondly, borderline personality disorder (BPD) and impulsivity were identified as important risk markers for suicidal behaviour, especially among opioid-dependent individuals. The study concluded that the treatment of BPD should be prioritised among this group. Third, self-mutilation was identified as a clinically significant problem in its own right, however, when combined with a history of attempted suicide, the psychological dysfunction observed was found to be very high. Fourth, non-fatal opioid overdose and suicide attempts were found to be distinct behaviours. The risk factors for each were completely different. While drug-related risks were associated with non-fatal overdose, the risk markers for suicide attempts were related to the presence of psychological disorders. This thesis has highlighted important areas of concern for clinical interventions as well as for future research to explore. Considering this is the first study of its kind, future research should focus on its replication.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comorbidity</field><field name="subject">Opioid dependence</field><field name="subject">Suicidal behaviour</field><field name="subject">Personality disorders</field><field name="subject">Opioid habit</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screen and stencil print technologies for  industrial N-type silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Matthew Bruce, ARC Centre of Excellence in Advanced Silicon Photovoltaics &amp; Photonics, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">To ensure that photovoltaics contributes significantly to future world energy production, the cost per watt of producing solar cells needs to be drastically reduced. The use of n-type silicon wafers in conjunction with industrial print technology has the potential to lower the cost per watt of solar cells. The use of n-type silicon is expected to allow the use of cheaper Cz substrates, without a corresponding loss in device efficiency. Printed metallisation is well utilised by the PV industry due to its low cost, yet there are few examples of its application to n-type solar cells. This thesis explores the use of n-type Cz silicon with printed metallisation and diffusion from printed sources in creating industrially applicable solar cell structures. 	The thesis begins with an overview of existing n-type solar cell structures, previous printed thick film metallisation research and previous research into printed dopant sources. A study of printed thick-film metallisation for n-type solar cells is then presented, which details the fabrication of boron doped p-type emitters followed by a survey of thick film Ag, Al, and Ag/Al inks for making contact to a p-emitter layer. Drawbacks of the various inks include high contact resistance, low metal conductivity or both. A cofire regime for front and rear contacts is established and an optimal emitter selected. A study of printed dopant pastes is presented, with an objective to achieve selective, heavily doped regions under metal contacts without significantly compromising minority carrier lifetime in solar cells. It is found that heavily doped regions are achievable with both boron and phosphorus, but that only phosphorus paste was capable of post-processing lifetime compatible with good efficiencies. The effect of belt furnace processing on n-type silicon wafers is explored, with large losses in implied voltage observed due to contamination of Si wafers from transition metals present in the belt furnace. Due to exposure to chromium in the belt furnace, no significant advantage in using n-type wafers instead of p-type is observed during the belt furnace processing step. Finally, working solar cells with efficiencies up to 16.1% are fabricated utilising knowledge acquired in the earlier chapters. The solar cells are characterised using several new photoluminescence techniques, including photoluminescence with current extraction to measure the quality of metal contacts. The work in this thesis indicates that n-type printed silicon solar cell technology shows potential for good performance at low cost.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">screen printing</field><field name="subject">n-type silicon</field><field name="subject">n-type solar cells</field><field name="subject">stencil printing</field><field name="subject">screen print dopant sources</field><field name="subject">photoluminescence</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Solar cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anchor free localization for ad-hoc wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Nawaz, Sarfraz, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wireless sensor networks allow us to instrument our world in novel ways providing detailed insight that had not been possible earlier. Since these networks provide an interface to the physical world, it is necessary for each sensor node to learn its location in the physical space. The availability of location information at individual sensor nodes allows the network to provide higher layer services such as location stamped event reporting, geographic routing, in-network processing etc. A wide range of these sensor network protocols do not require absolute node coordinates and can work with relative node positions. This motivates for the need of anchor free localization algorithms that localize the individual sensor nodes with respect to each other in a local coordinate system. Such algorithms allow the sensor networks to be decoupled from external infrastructure and become truly place and play systems.  The primary contributions of this thesis include two anchor free localization algorithms and one location refinement algorithm for ad-hoc wireless sensor networks. Our distributed anchor free localization algorithms do not require any external infrastructure in the form of landmark or manually initialized anchor nodes. These algorithms use measured inter-node distances among some node pairs and localize the entire network in a local coordinate system up to a global translation, rotation and reflection. The relative or virtual coordinates assigned by these algorithms can be readily used with a range of sensor network services like geographic routing, data aggregation, topology control etc.  Our first localization algorithm is based on a distributed collaborative approach where all of the nodes in the network collaborate with each other to select a set of nodes. These nodes are localized and then used as reference nodes for the remaining sensor nodes. The novelty of this approach is that instead of solving the localization problem for the entire network upfront, first a small well-formed localization problem is solved and then these results are used to solve the localization problem for the remaining nodes in the network.  Our second localization algorithm borrows ideas from the data visualization field and exploits the general undirected graph drawing theory to solve the sensor network localization problem. This algorithm divides the network into a large number of small overlapping clusters and creates local coordinate systems for each of the clusters. These clusters are then merged together in a single coordinate system using a novel distributed algorithm that seeks to minimize the error during this merge process.  Our final contribution is a distributed location refinement algorithm that can be used with any of the range based localization algorithms to refine the sensor node coordinates to conform to the measured inter-node distances. We model this coordinate refinement problem as an unconstrained non-linear optimization problem and then transform this optimization problem into an aggregate computation problem. We propose two different approaches to solve this aggregate computation problem in a distributed manner.  We evaluate our algorithms with detailed simulations using both Matlab and TinyOS simulator TOSSIM. We also validate our simulation results with experimentation carried out on a real network of MIT Cricket motes. We conclude this thesis with lessons learned during this research and discuss some future directions which can be explored to advance the research in sensor network localization.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Location</field><field name="subject">Localization</field><field name="subject">Wireless networks</field><field name="subject">Localization theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling 802.11 networks for multimedia applications</field><field name="creator">Dao, Trong Nghia, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the development of new mathematical models for the IEEE 802.11??s access mechanisms, with a particular focus on DCF and EDCA. Accurate mathematical models for the DCF and EDCA access mechanisms provide many benefits, such as improved performance analysis, easier network capacity planning, and robust network design. A feature that permeates the work presented in this thesis is the application of our new models to network environments where both saturated and non-saturated traffic sources are present. The scenario in which multiple traffic sources are present is more technically challenging, but provides for a more realistic setting.  Our first contribution is the development of a new Markov model for non-saturated DCF in order to predict the network throughput. This model takes into account several details of the protocol that have been hitherto neglected. In addition, we apply a novel treatment of the packet service time within our model. We show how the inclusion of these effects provides more accurate predictions of network throughput than earlier works.  Our second contribution is the development of a new analytical model for EDCA, again in order to predict network throughput. Our new EDCA model is based on a replacement of the normal AIFS parameter of EDCA with a new parameter more closely associated with DCF. This novel procedure allows EDCA to be viewed as a modified multi-mode version of DCF.  Our third contribution is the simultaneous application of our new Markov models to both the non-saturated and the saturated regime. Hitherto, network throughput predictions for these regimes have required completely separate mathematical models. The convergence property of our model in the two regimes provides a new method to estimate the network capacity of the network.  Our fourth contribution relates to predictions for the multimedia capacity of 802.11 networks. Our multimedia capacity analysis, which is based on modifications to our Markov model, is new in that it can be applied to a broad range of quality of service requirements. Finally, we highlight the use of our analysis in the context of emerging location-enabled networks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modelling, Markov chain</field><field name="subject">802.11, CSMA/CA</field><field name="subject">Non-saturated traffic, Multimedia applications</field><field name="subject">IEEE 802.11 (Standard)</field><field name="subject">Multimedia systems</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extinction of conditioned fear in the developing rat</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jee Hyun, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present thesis examined extinction of conditioned fear in the developing rat. In the adult rat, the hippocampus is thought to be important for the context-specificity of extinction. Because the hippocampus is a late-maturing structure, it was hypothesised that context-modulation of extinction may be different across development. The first series of experiments investigated reinstatement of extinguished fear in the developing rat (Chapter 2). The results showed that P24 rats exhibited context-specific reinstatement. On the other hand, P17 rats did not exhibit reinstatement of extinguished fear following a US reminder treatment. The failure to see reinstatement in P17 rats was not due to the reminder treatment being ineffective in these rats because the same treatment alleviated spontaneous forgetting in rat this age. The second series of experiments then examined the renewal effect and GABAergic involvement in extinction in P24 and P17 rats (Chapter 3). It was observed that P24 rats displayed renewal whereas P17 rats did not. Also, pre-test injection of FG7142 recovered extinguished fear in P24 rats but not in P17 rats, even across a range of doses. This failure to see any FG7142 effect on extinction in P17 rats was not due to the lack of responsiveness to this drug in these rats because FG7142 was found to be effective in alleviating spontaneous forgetting in rats this age. The third series of experiments then examined the effect of temporary inactivation of the amygdala on extinction and re-extinction in the developing rat (Chapter 4). It was observed that extinction retention is impaired in both P24 and P17 rats if the amygdala is inactivated during extinction training. Interestingly, when a CS that had been previously extinguished and then re-trained was re-extinguished, re-extinction was amygdala-independent if initial extinction occurred at 24 days of age but amygdala-dependent if initial extinction occurred at 17 days of age.

This is the first study on managerial benefits that considers all federal taxes in the Australian context.  While the managerial benefits of tax compliance were first identified by Sandford in the 1980s, there is only limited evidence to date about their perception by business taxpayers and no evidence at all about their actual occurrence. The work undertaken by Sandford together with the findings of empirical research on accounting in small businesses, provide the framework for the development of research hypotheses. With the purpose of testing these hypotheses, the research examines concurrently a sample of small businesses located in a regional area of Australia, and a sample of similar entities located in an external territory of Australia exempt from federal taxes and with minimal tax compliance obligations. The thesis adopts a mixed research method which combines a survey and a case study component from which a number of convergent results emerge.  Results show that bookkeeping requirements imposed by tax compliance compel small businesses to upgrade their accounting systems, typically in the form of computerisation. The increased sophistication of the accounting system following this upgrade allows small businesses to derive managerial benefits in the form of a better knowledge of their financial affairs. The study also demonstrates that when small businesses seek the assistance of an accountant to comply with their tax compliance obligations, managerial benefits may be derived in the form of informal business advice and other services that come as a spin-off from tax compliance work. The findings of the research also indicate that a majority of small businesses value positively the accounting information generated as a result of tax imposed record keeping requirements, however further studies are required to establish the extent to which the additional information has a positive effect on decision making.  Finally, the study identifies various possible approaches to quantify managerial benefits including a method based on the costs of alternative resources, and a valuation based on what owner-managers would be prepared to pay for the information.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small business -- Accounting.</field><field name="subject">Tax compliance costs.</field><field name="subject">Tax compliance benefits.</field><field name="subject">Tax accounting -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Tax accounting -- Law and legislation -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises -- Finance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods for training people's decision-making judgment: a review</field><field name="creator">Moulton, Bruce David, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The subject of enquiry is the variation seen in the results of a specific set of studies about methods for training people&#146;s judgment. This review attempts to synthesise the studies&#146; findings, and tests hypotheses about the causes of the variation. Research questions ask if variation is attributable to differences in participant characteristics, different aspects of judgment having been targeted, different tasks having been performed or different training strategies having been used. Relevant literature was reviewed, and studies that reported a method for training an aspect of judgment were selected for further quantitative analysis if at least two groups had been randomly selected from a larger set of human adults, one of which received training that another did not, and where, during the test phase, members of no group had access to tools or resources, performed tasks, or received feedback which members of another group did not. A meta-analysis of statistical data from 39 published studies was conducted. The findings are interpreted as indicating variation in the effect of training is attributable to differences in task type and differences in training strategy. The effect of training is greatest in the studies that have diagnostic tasks (p&lt;0.05). The studies that trained participants with examples have, on average, greater effect sizes than studies that did not (p&lt;0.05). Implications, limitations, and avenues for further research are discussed. It is concluded that the findings indicate that different tasks and different training strategies account for a significant proportion of the variation in training effect seen between the selected studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice</field><field name="subject">Judgement</field><field name="subject">Decision</field><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algebraic aspects of integrability and reversibility in maps</field><field name="creator">Jogia, Danesh Michael, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">We study the cause of the signature over finite fields of integrability in two dimensional discrete dynamical systems by using theory from algebraic geometry. In particular the theory of elliptic curves is used to prove the major result of the thesis: that all birational maps that preserve an elliptic curve necessarily act on that elliptic curve as addition under the associated group law. Our result generalises special cases previously given in the literature. We apply this theorem to the specific cases when the ground fields are finite fields of prime order and the function field $mathbb{C}(t)$. In the former case, this yields an explanation of the aforementioned signature over finite fields of integrability. In the latter case we arrive at an analogue of the Arnol'd-Liouville theorem. Other results that are related to this approach to integrability are also proven and their consequences considered in examples. Of particular importance are two separate items: (i) we define a generalization of integrability called mixing and examine its relation to integrability; and (ii) we use the concept of rotation number to study differences and similarities between birational integrable maps that preserve the same foliation. The final chapter is given over to considering the existence of the signature of reversibility in higher (three and four) dimensional maps. A conjecture regarding the distribution of periodic orbits generated by such maps when considered over finite fields is given along with numerical evidence to support the conjecture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">maps over finite fields</field><field name="subject">integrability</field><field name="subject">reversibility</field><field name="subject">algebraic dynamics</field><field name="subject">Geometry, Algebraic</field><field name="subject">Finite fields (Algebra)</field><field name="subject">Maps</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and curriculum design in community health nurse education: a picture of a journey on the river Gambia</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Angela Jane, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thirty years after the concept of primary health care (PHC) was declared the path to health for all, a crisis continues in human resources for health in Africa. This involves the low prioritisation of education and training for primary health care personnel (PHCP) which is crucial to effective practice in severely under-resourced settings. The curriculum required for this education, involving pictures and textual materials, must meet the needs and capacities of the learners so that learning transfer can occur and community health needs are met. This research set out to establish the basis upon which text and pictures should be incorporated into curriculum to address the requirements of community health nurses (CHNs) in The Gambia. A pragmatic, three phased, mixed methodological design was selected for this study. Curricula for African PHCP were first collected and examined using content analysis to determine the rationale for pictures and text. The second phase employed psychometric testing and statistical analysis to establish if learning style preferences for pictures and text were important in Gambian CHN learning. In the final phase, interviews with CHN students explored their preferences for pictures and text and how these preferences should be accommodated in curriculum.  The research found that much of the PHCP curriculum analysed was generic, used traditional didactic approaches and focused on written knowledge-based assessment. Learning style preferences were not found to be a consideration and were unidentifiable in this context. Socio-cultural factors significantly impacted upon student CHN learning, but were not adequately addressed in the curriculum materials examined. In addition, CHNs preferred practical learning through primary, multi-sensory experiences.  These findings support the conclusion that the localisation of CHN curriculum is required in order to provide a socio-cultural context for learning that is meaningful, rich, interactive and responsive to learner needs. This demands a reconnection with PHC principles of equity and participation which should underpin this curriculum. The thesis argues that an ecological framework better articulates the link between PHCP education and training, practice, and community needs, and should serve to guide curriculum design. Six strategies are identified that could be extended to African PHCP course design.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary health care</field><field name="subject">Nurse education</field><field name="subject">Africa</field><field name="subject">Community health nursing -- Gambia</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of human cytomegalovirus susceptibility to novel antiviral agents</field><field name="creator">Jun, Min, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant infectious agent causing disease in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients, transplant recipients, and neonates.  The current antiviral therapeutic strategy against CMV is limited in its utility due to the inherent toxicity and lack of bioavailability of currently available anti-CMV agents, ganciclovir (GCV), cidofovir (CDV), and foscarnet (FOS). The development of the prodrug of GCV, valganciclovir (val-GCV), has vastly improved the bioavailability profile of GCV. However, val-GCV demonstrates limited effectiveness against tissue-invasive CMV diseases as side effects involved with traditional intravenously administered GCV such as haematologic and reproductive toxicities remain. In addition, the emergence of antiviral resistant CMV mutant strains due to prolonged treatment with currently available antivirals necessitates the development of novel anti-CMV agents with reduced toxicity and improved bioavailability. In this study, select groups of novel compounds were analysed for their potential for further development as anti-CMV agents. Three groups of compounds were identified based on two screening methods which included the computer simulated screening process of compounds known as in silico screening and the traditional method of random screening. The first group of compounds (CATi) were identified by in silico screening against the CMV DNA polymerase catalytic aspartate triad, resulting in the identification of 31 compounds with the potential for inhibitory activity against CMV. The second group of compounds (PRO-i) were identified through in silico screening against the CMV protease, identifying a total of 18 lead compounds exhibiting structural complementarity with CMV protease. The third and final group of compounds (TPEX) were identified through random screening and consisted of plant extracts purified from tropical plants. All three compounds were initially screened for cytotoxicity against human fibroblasts. Plaque reduction assays were performed using compounds with acceptable levels of cytotoxicity to determine the ability of the compounds to inhibit the replication of the laboratory antiviral sensitive CMV strain, Towne. Two of the PRO-i compounds demonstrated good antiviral activity against CMV. Eleven percent (2/18) of the PRO-i compounds inhibited CMV replication, with PRO-i-43 and PRO-i??-44 displaying mean 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 4.8 ?? 1.2 ??M and 8.04 ??M, respectively. PRO-i-43 and PRO-i-44 are thus good candidates for further development as novel antiviral agents against CMV. The majority of CATi and TPEX compounds displayed significant cytotoxicity against human fibroblasts and compounds with acceptable levels of cytotoxicities did not significantly inhibit CMV replication. However, the identification of compounds with low cytotoxicities provides a good foundation for further development of novel anti-CMV agents with superior antiviral activity. In silico screening against three-dimensional viral protein models is a useful strategy for the identification of novel antiviral agents with the potential for inhibitory activity against CMV. Structural modification to produce potent derivatives of the identified anti-CMV compounds (PRO-i-43 and PRO-i-44) is a good option for the further development of novel antiviral agents against CMV. Such further examination of the identified compounds with anti-CMV activity is required to investigate their activity against not only antiviral sensitive CMV strains but also resistant CMV strains. Further investigations will yield new insights into their target, allowing further identification of compounds with potential anti-CMV activity with pharmaceutical application.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plaque reduction assay</field><field name="subject">In silico screening</field><field name="subject">Cytomegaloviruses</field><field name="subject">Human cytomegalovirus</field><field name="subject">Antivirals</field><field name="subject">Antiviral agents</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A vision prosthesis neurostimulator: progress towards the realisation of a neural prosthesis for the blind</field><field name="creator">Dommel, Norbert Brian, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Restoring vision to the blind has been an objective of several research teams for a number of years. It is known that spots of light -- phosphenes -- can be elicited by way of electrical stimulation of surviving retinal neurons. Beyond this, however, our understanding of prosthetic vision remains rudimentary.  To advance the realisation of a clinically viable prosthesis for the blind, a versatile integrated circuit neurostimulator was designed, manufactured, and verified. The neurostimulator provides electrical stimuli to surviving neurons in the visual pathway, affording blind patients some form of patterned vision; besides other benefits (independence), this limited vision would let patients distinguish between day and night (resetting their circadian rhythm).  This thesis presents the development of the neurostimulator, an interdisciplinary work bridging engineering and medicine. Features of the neurostimulator include: high-voltage CMOS transistors in key circuits, to prevent voltage compliance issues due to an unknown or changing combined tissue and electrode/tissue interface impedance; simultaneous stimulation using current sources and sinks, with return electrodes configured to provide maximum charge containment at each stimulation site; stimuli delivered to a two dimensional mosaic of hexagonally packed electrodes, multiplexing current sources and sinks to allow each electrode in the whole mosaic to become a stimulation site; electrode shorting to remove excess charge accumulated during each stimulation phase.  Detailed electrical testing and characterisation verified that the neurostimulator performed as specified, and comparable to, or better than, other vision prostheses neurostimulators. In addition, results from several animal experiments verified that the neurostimulator can elicit electrically evoked visual responses. The features of the neurostimulator enable research into how simultaneous electrical stimulation affects the visual neural pathways; those research results could impact other neural prosthetics research and devices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neural prosthesis</field><field name="subject">vision prosthesis</field><field name="subject">neurostimulator</field><field name="subject">retinal prosthesis</field><field name="subject">ASIC</field><field name="subject">CMOS</field><field name="subject">Blind</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibrational characteristics of structures with uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Geoffrey Iain, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the prediction of the vibro-acoustic response of structures with uncertain properties in the mid frequency region. The motivation for this research is the growing need of engineers to understand the responses of a group of similar structures ranging from vehicles, aircraft and aerospace structures, to household whitegood appliances. These structures are complex in geometry and may possess variability in their material or geometric properties, as well as variation arising from the assembly and manufacturing processes. Small variations can have a significant effect on a dynamic response of a structure, and the effect of structural uncertainties increases as the frequency increases. Deterministic modelling techniques such as finite element analysis are only suitable to model complex structures at low frequencies. Furthermore, FEA cannot easily account for uncertainty or randomness in structural parameters. High frequency dynamic predictive techniques such as Statistical Energy Analysis can account for structural uncertainty but is limited to structures with high modal density. There exists a frequency range between the two methods in which neither technique can be applied with great confidence. The objective of this thesis is to investigate predictive techniques for mid frequency vibration analysis of dynamic systems with structural uncertainties.  The first part of this work is to numerically characterise the effect of a range of uncertainties on the modal statistics of structures. The degree of uncertainty required to achieve universality of the statistical properties is investigated. This is achieved by examining the modal statistics of dynamic systems with a range of uncertainty, corresponding to uncertainty due to mass and stiffness perturbations, uncertainty at the boundaries of a structure, uncertainty in the coupling between structures, uncertainty in the material properties of a structure and uncertainty in the geometry of a structure. Several structures are examined corresponding to a plate with masses and/or linear springs added at random locations, a plate with torsional springs attached at random locations along its boundary edges, two plates coupled by linear springs at random locations, a mass-loaded coupled L-shaped plate, a mass-loaded frame-plate structure, and a plate with varying Young's modulus, density and thickness. The natural frequencies of the aforementioned structures have been derived using either the Lagrange-Rayleigh-Ritz technique, finite element analysis, or the use of interval analysis in conjunction with FEA.  The natural frequency statistics of structures with uncertain properties are observed using two statistical measures; the statistical overlap factor and the probability density function of the spacing between successive natural frequencies. The statistical overlap factor is defined by the variation in a natural frequency from its mean value measured across an ensemble of nominally identical structures with uncertainty. For a single ensemble member, the probability density function of the spacing between successive natural frequencies is compared to a Rayleigh distribution of the mean frequency spacing. A Rayleigh distribution of modal spacings is a feature of the universality exhibited by structures with uncertainty. To further investigate the effect of structural uncertainty on the vibrational characteristics of structures, the interval analysis is applied to finite element models of a plate with uncertainty in its material properties and dimensions. Using this method, the Young's modulus, density and thickness of a rectangular plate were set to vary by a small amount within predefined bounds. Using finite element equations, the natural frequencies and modeshapes of the structure were then determined in terms of the Young's modulus, density and plate thickness. For the mass and spring loaded plates, the springs were shown to affect the lower order modes while the masses had a significant effect on the higher order modes. As the frequency increased, only a small amount of perturbation was sufficient to affect the natural frequencies of a structure. Using the interval analysis method, the variation of the natural frequencies from their deterministic value increased as the frequency increased.  An ergodic hypothesis was used to examine the responses statistics of structures with uncertainty. Three structures have been computationally studied corresponding to two plates coupled by springs, an L-shaped plate and a frame plate structure. Uncertainty has been generated for the two coupled plates by locating the springs randomly across the surface of the two plates. For the L-shaped plate and a frame plate structure, uncertainty was generated by randomly positioning small masses across the plates. Using the ergodic hypothesis, the frequency averaged response on one member of an ensemble is compare with the ensemble averaged response. It was found that the ensemble averaged response was well predicted by a frequency averaged response of a single ensemble member. The width of the frequency averaging band was shown to have a large influence on the quality of the match between the frequency and ensemble averaged responses. Results were significantly improved using a frequency averaging bandwidth which varies proportionally to frequency.  Finally, experiments have been conducted on an L-shaped plate, a frame plate structure and a vehicle to validate the computational results for the natural frequency and response statistics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mid frequency.</field><field name="subject">Vibration.</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty.</field><field name="subject">Dynamics -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagnosis of human sub-telomeric chromosomal deletions by Microarray</field><field name="creator">Darmanian, Artur Pavlovich, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  A major cause of genetic disease is associated with chromosomal imbalances, such as deletions (subtelomeric, terminal and interstitial), duplications, and unbalanced translocations present in a particular chromosome segment. The diagnosis of many genetic diseases remains problematic. This is due in part to difficulty in detection of DNA copy number changes, when these are either too small (for conventional cytogenetics) or too large, for standard molecular approaches. From this viewpoint, the development of new screening methods with improvement of resolution is very important. Genome-wide screening at a molecular level began to appear feasible with the completion of the human genome sequence. From this beginning, high-resolution whole-genome technologies could be envisaged, to improve the diagnostic detection rate for even the smallest of chromosomal imbalances.  The technique known as ???array-based comparative genomic hybridization??? (array-CGH) does allow such a high-resolution screening, by use of reference DNA probes, printed onto arrays, thus consisting of thousands of genomic clones. In this study we extensively investigated many major aspects of array-CGH technology from preparation of microarray probes and printing microarray slides, to a development of custom protocols and custom softwares for data processing and analysis. We have trailed several array types and protocols, direct and indirect DNA labelling techniques and, as a result, we have achieved the practical application which was our target at the onset of this work. This was to use a modified array-CGH method, as a robust and economical diagnostic test in detection of deletions and duplications within the human genome. The project has been successful, in terms of one very important outcome: The laboratory in which this work was done is now the leading clinical diagnostic lab in this field, in Australia???s most populous state of New South Wales. That achievement would not have been possible without a very lengthy period of developmental work, including that which comprises much of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Diagnostics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being somewhere: young homeless people in inner-city Sydney</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Catherine , Social Policy Research Centre, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Drawing on in-depth interviews, participant observation and my experiences of working with young homeless people in refuges, in this thesis I develop an analysis which identifies some key spatial practices through which young people negotiate the field of homelessness in inner-city Sydney. The particular contribution of this work is to consider homelessness in terms of a theorised understanding of the broader role of place within homelessness, rather than in terms of the immediacy of cause or solution. While acknowledging the importance of the large body of work which has focused on the structural causes of homelessness and the need for a clear policy-oriented definition of homelessness, I develop an alternative agenda for a focus on young homeless people's struggles to feel 'in place' and 'at home'. These struggles throw into relief the need to understand young people???s homelessness in terms of a search, not just for a place to stay, but for a place to belong. Utilising the rich body of work which explores the important relation of place and subjectivity, I connect young people???s experiences of place within homelessness with the broader social and phenomenological concepts of ???displacement??? and ???implacement???. In particular, I focus on the spatial relations through which young people construct and organise their daily paths and begin to make sense of their often painful and chaotic lives and their fears about the future. I contextualise their fragile experiences of being somewhere in a broader spatial structure of constant movement and grief and feelings of alienation from the wider community. I consider the enduring role of past homes in their continuing struggle to piece together a way of ???being at home??? both in terms of drawing together a network of physical places of safety and in terms of experiencing a sense of acceptance, recognition and rootedness through place. I point to the critical need to include broader understandings of both home and homelessness in addressing the displacement which shapes the experience of homelessness for young people and impacts on the success of immediate measures developed to respond to it.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homeless youth -- New South Wales -- Sydney -- Social conditions.</field><field name="subject">Homelessness -- New South Wales -- Sydney.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peacock pilgrimage: an ode to India</field><field name="creator">Fowler-Smith, Penelope Jane, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The project entitled PEACOCK PILGRIMAGE comprises two components: the screenplay for a feature film, entitled Peacock Angel, and an exegesis, which explores the underlying influences on the screenplay. Peacock Angel is the story of a young girl, Deva, who grew up in India with a fascination for peacocks, especially the fictional peacock angel. After a time of isolation as a teenager in the West, she returns to India to reconcile with a tragic past and reconnect with her true longings. India is the place that mends her wounded heart. Within the symbolic realms of the screenplay Deva, as the central character, becomes the peacock &#145;goddess&#146;. Her journey allows us to explore layers within the themes of identity, memory and fantasy. The project holds an East/West theme, of disillusionment with Western material values and appreciation of the depth of Indian culture, of &#147;the land where the heart is king&#148;. Field research on the peacock, the key motif of the project, has led me on a journey through India that has been full of synchronicity and given me a particularly rich taste of her timeless culture. The exegesis elaborates on aspects of my journey, on the concepts of synchronicity and pilgrimage, and on the motif of peacock &#150; highlighting its symbolic and mythical meanings.

Because practice is self-directed, motivational effects on its efficiency are especially salient. One construct that has received little attention in relation to practising is self-determination theory, which interprets motivation as lying along a continuum of perceived autonomy. This mixed-methods study investigated links between motivational beliefs and self-regulated practising behaviour through a two-phase design. In Phase One, 677 music examination candidates aged 8-19 completed a questionnaire consisting of items addressing practising behaviour and perceived musical competence; in addition, the Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ; Ryan &amp; Connell, 1989) was adapted to explore intrinsic-extrinsic motives for learning an instrument. Factor analysis of the SRQ revealed five dimensions with partial correspondence to earlier research: internal, external, social, shame-related, and exam-related motives. Three practice behaviour factors consistent with self-regulated learning theory emerged: effort management, monitoring, and strategy use. Results of structural equation modelling showed that internal motivation accounted best for variance in these three types of practising behaviour, with a small added effect from competence beliefs and exam-related motivation. Phase Two consisted of observational case studies of four of the questionnaire participants preparing for their subsequent annual examination. Adolescent, intermediate-level musicians were recorded while practising at home; immediately afterwards, they watched the videotape and verbalised any recollected thoughts. The procedure concluded with a semi-structured interview and debriefing. The videotapes were analysed with The Observer Video-Pro and combined with verbal data; emerging themes were then compared with issues arising from the interviews. The observational aspect of the case studies largely confirmed the importance of three cyclical self-regulatory processes emerging from Phase One: (a) effort management and motivational self-regulation, (b) the role of self-monitoring of accuracy, and (c) the use of corrective strategies, such as structured repetition, task simplification, and vocalisation. The mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods used in the study has uncovered a rich body of information that begins to clarify the complex motivational and behavioural nature of young people practising a musical instrument.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Self-regulated learning theory</field><field name="subject">Music education</field><field name="subject">Achievement motivation</field><field name="subject">Self-determination theory</field><field name="subject">Musicians</field><field name="subject">Motivation in education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Settlement of marine fouling organisms in response to novel antifouling coatings</field><field name="creator">Afsar, Anisul, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surfaces submerged in marine environments rapidly get colonized by marine organisms, a process known as biofouling. Fouling costs maritime industries billions of dollars annually. The most common methods of combating marine biofouling are toxin containing antifouling coatings which often have detrimental non-target environmental effects. These effects and proposed bans on harmful substances in antifouling coatings, mandates development of more environmentally friendly antifouling technologies. Of these, foul-release coatings, which minimize attachment and adhesion of fouling organisms (rather than killing them) are promising alternatives. Here I explored the utility of petroleum waxes as novel antifouling/foul-release coatings. I first investigated the responses of propagules (larvae or spores) of six common fouling organisms to wax coatings in the laboratory. A wide variation in the response of these different organisms, and in the different types of response (settlement, adhesion, etc.) by the same organism, was observed, but the most inhibitory coatings were those made from microcrystalline wax and silicone oil. However, in field trials in Sydney Harbour, paraffin waxes had the strongest antifouling performance, with activity up to one year (the trial duration). These waxes also had strong foul-release effects, with fouling that did attach mostly removed by a low pressure water jet. Composition of fouling communities on paraffin waxes differed significantly from other waxes or controls, with little or no hard fouling organisms (barnacles, bivalves) on paraffin. The mechanisms of antifouling and foul-release actions of paraffin waxes appear to be due to changes in surface properties. The surfaces of the paraffin waxes changed noticeably after 4 - 8 weeks immersion in the sea or in seawater aquaria. Antibiotic treatments showed that this change in surface appearance was due to biological (microbial) activity. Bacteria appear to remove the amorphous phase from the surface of the paraffin waxes, revealing an underlying crystalline phase, which is less affected by bacterial action. I suggest that these crystals form a microstructured ?bed of nails? of crystals of varying shapes and sizes which inhibit settlement and reduce adhesion strength of those organisms which do settle.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foul-release</field><field name="subject">Biofouling</field><field name="subject">Antifouling</field><field name="subject">Wax</field><field name="subject">Marine fouling organisms</field><field name="subject">Coatings</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transmission power control in body-wearable sensor devices for healthcare monitoring</field><field name="creator">Xiao, Shuo, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Emerging body-wearable sensor devices for continuous health monitoring are severely energy constrained and yet required to offer high communication reliability under fluctuating channel conditions. This thesis aims at investigating the opportunities and challenges in the use of dynamic radio transmit power control for prolonging the lifetime of such devices. We first present extensive empirical evidence that the wireless link quality can change rapidly in body area networks, and a fixed transmit power results in either wasted energy (when the link is good) or low reliability (when the link is bad). We then propose a class of schemes feasible for practical implementation that adapt transmit power in real-time based on feedback information from the receiver. We show conservative, balanced, and aggressive adaptations of our scheme that progressively achieve higher energy savings of 14%-30% in exchange for higher potential packet losses (up to 10%). We also provide guidelines on how the parameters can be tuned to achieve the desired trade-off between energy savings and reliability within the chosen operating environment. Finally, we implement and profile our scheme on a MicaZ mote based platform, demonstrating that energy savings are achievable even with imperfect feedback information, and report preliminary results on the ultra-low-power integrated healthcare monitoring platform from our collaborating partner Toumaz Technology. In conclusion, our work shows adaptive radio transmit power control as a low-cost way of extending the battery-life of severely energy constrained body wearable devices, and opens the door to further optimizations customized for specific deployment scenarios.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transmission Power Control</field><field name="subject">Body Sensor Network</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contact resistance study on polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass</field><field name="creator">Shi, Lei, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin-film solar cells are widely recognised to have the potential to compete with fossil fuels in the electricity market due to their low cost per peak Watt. The Thin-Film Group at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) is engaged in developing polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film solar cells on glass using e-beam evaporation technology. We believe our solar cells have the potential of significantly lowering the manufacturing cost compared to conventional, PECVD-fabricated thin-film solar cells. After years of materials research, the focus of the Group??s work is now moving to the metallisation of evaporated solar cells. Minimising various kinds of losses is the main challenge of the cell metallisation procedure, within which the contact resistance is always a big issue. In this thesis, the contact resistance of aluminium contacts on poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass is investigated. To the best of the author??s knowledge, this is the first ever contact resistance investigation of Al contacts on evaporated poly-Si material for photovoltaic applications. Various transmission line models (TLM) are employed to measure the contact resistance. An improved TLM model is developed to increase the measurement precision and, simultaneously, to simplify the TLM pattern fabrication process. In order to accommodate the particular requirements of poly-Si coated glass substrates, a TLM pattern fabrication process using photolithography is established. Furthermore, a Kelvin sense tester is set up to ensure an accurate measurement of the contact resistance. After establishment of the TLM technique at UNSW, it is successfully tested on singlecrystalline silicon wafer samples. The thermal annealing process of the contacts is also optimised. Then, the general behaviour of Al contacts on uniformly doped poly-Si films (i.e., no p-n junction) is investigated using the verified TLM technique. The long-term stability of the contacts is also studied. This is followed by an investigation of the contact resistance of the back surface field and emitter layers of different types of poly-Si thin-film solar cells. Finally, a novel contact resistance measurement model is proposed that is believed to be able to overcome the measurement bottleneck of the transmission line models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poly-Si</field><field name="subject">Contact resistance</field><field name="subject">Thin-film solar cells</field><field name="subject">Transmission line model</field><field name="subject">Polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">Solar cells</field><field name="subject">Glass</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Downstream targets of the oestrogen receptor and endocrine resistance</field><field name="creator">McNeil, Catriona Mairi, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The transcription factor c-Myc is an early downstream target of oestrogen action in breast cancer cells in culture and it has been speculated that aberrant c-Myc expression may mediate antioestrogen resistance. However, studies of c-Myc protein expression as either a prognostic or predictive marker in human breast cancer have been limited and contradictory, as have been studies of c-Myc expression during breast cancer evolution. In order to assess the relationship between c-Myc protein expression and outcome from breast cancer, a representative cohort of 292 women with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and linked clinicopathological data was assembled and tissue microarrays (TMA) generated from the archived breast cancer specimens. Detailed assessments of the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 were also conducted and analysed in relation to c-Myc expression using immunohistochemistry. Changes in c-Myc protein expression in a TMA model of breast cancer evolution were also conducted. Finally the cell-cycle effects of low-level constitutive c-Myc expression and high-level inducible c-Myc expression were evaluated in MCF-7 cells in vitro. Key novel results obtained were that c-Myc protein expression changed from preferentially nuclear to preferentially cytoplasmic during the evolution of breast cancer. In women with early invasive breast carcinoma, a "high-risk" cytoplasmic predominant c-Myc expression pattern was defined (~13% of cases) that independently predicted for poor outcome generally, among ER positive cases and in ER postive cases treated with endocrine therapy. In vitro studies confirmed that c-Myc overexpression was associated with resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of anti-oestrogens with persistence of both cyclin D1-cdk4 and cyclin E-cdk2 activities in the face of anti-oestrogen treatment. Further novel findings were that high cyclin D1 expression (upper 10% of expressors) was an independent predictor of poor outcome among ER positive breast cancer cases. Amongst ER + PR positive cases, both "high-risk" c-Myc expression and high level cyclin D1 expression were independent predictors of poor outcome. In summary, these data indicate that aberrant expression of the cell cycle proteins c-Myc and cyclin D1 may result in poor breast cancer outcomes in hormone receptor positive breast cancer and reinforces the importance of the cell cycle as a potential site of therapeutic manipulation in endocrine-resistant breast cancer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer.</field><field name="subject">C-Myc.</field><field name="subject">Endocrine resistance.</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aboriginal Australian heritage in the postcolonial city: sites of anti-colonial resistance and continuing presence</field><field name="creator">Gandhi, Vidhu, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aboriginal Australian heritage forms a significant and celebrated part of Australian heritage. Set within the institutional frameworks of a predominantly ??white?? European Australian heritage practice, Aboriginal heritage has been promoted as the heritage of a people who belonged to the distant, pre-colonial past and who were an integral and sustainable part of the natural environment. These controlled and carefully packaged meanings of Aboriginal heritage have underwritten aspects of urban Aboriginal presence and history that prevail in the (previously) colonial city. In the midst of the city which seeks to cling to selected images of its colonial past urban Aboriginal heritage emerges as a significant challenge to a largely ??white??, (post)colonial Australian heritage practice. The distinctively Aboriginal sense of anti-colonialism that underlines claims to urban sites of Aboriginal significance unsettles the colonial stereotypes that are associated with Aboriginal heritage and disrupts the ??purity?? of the city by penetrating the stronghold of colonial heritage. However, despite the challenge to the colonising imperatives of heritage practice, the fact that urban Aboriginal heritage continues to be a deeply contested reality indicates that heritage practice has failed to move beyond its predominantly colonial legacy. It knowingly or unwittingly maintains the stronghold of colonial heritage in the city by selectively and often with reluctance, recognising a few sites of contested Aboriginal heritage such as the Old Swan Brewery and Bennett House in Perth. Furthermore, the listing of these sites according to very narrow and largely Eurocentric perceptions of Aboriginal heritage makes it quite difficult for other sites which fall outside these considerations to be included as part of the urban built environment. Importantly this thesis demonstrates that it is most often in the case of Aboriginal sites of political resistance such as The Block in Redfern, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra and Australian Hall in Sydney, that heritage practice tends to maintain its hegemony as these sites are a reminder of the continuing disenfranchised condition of Aboriginal peoples, in a nation which considers itself to be postcolonial.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urban</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Antiquities</field><field name="subject">Heritage</field><field name="subject">Postcolonial</field><field name="subject">Historic sites -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telomeres and telomerase in haematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow endothelial cells</field><field name="creator">Schuller, Christine, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In normal human somatic cells, the length of telomeres (chromosomal end structures) decreases with each cell division until reaching a critically short length, which halts cell proliferation and induces senescence. The enzyme telomerase, which functions to maintain telomeres at a length that is permissive for cell division, is expressed in approximately 85% of cancer cells and some stem and progenitor cells, including haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), but not most other normal somatic cells. Previous investigations have demonstrated that ectopic expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) reconstitutes telomerase activity, resulting in telomere elongation in some normal human cell types. However, similar experiments performed in HPCs and endothelial cells have demonstrated a dissociation between the expression of telomerase activity and telomere lengthening. This thesis is focussed on further investigating telomerase-mediated telomere length regulation in HPCs and endothelial cells.  Short telomeres in bone marrow and blood leukocytes are associated with the development of disorders linked to bone marrow failure. However, to date a relationship between telomere length and myeloid cell proliferative potential has not been demonstrated. In the current investigations, the telomere length and proliferative potential of 31 cord blood-derived HPCs was determined. Regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between mean telomere length and erythroid cell expansion, but not expansion of other myeloid lineage cells. Another novel finding was that telomerase activity was upregulated in lineage-committed CD34- erythroid cells that were positive for the erythroid-specific lineage marker glycophorin A. It was also functionally demonstrated that telomerase activity facilitates the maximum expansion of erythroid cells.  To address the dissociation between telomerase activity and telomere maintenance in BMECs, a dominant negative mutant of the telomere binding protein TRF1, which functions to regulate telomere accessibility, was over-expressed in hTERT-transduced BMECs. These studies showed that telomere access, as well as oncogene expression and exposure to oxidative stress, contribute to telomere length regulation in BMECs. Overall, the results from these investigations demonstrate for the first time the functional significance of telomere length and telomerase activity in ex vivo expansion of erythroid cells, and provide novel insight to the molecular complexity of telomere length maintenance in endothelial cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endothelial cells.</field><field name="subject">Telomeres.</field><field name="subject">Haematopoiesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transparent large-page support for Itanium linux</field><field name="creator">Wienand, Ian Raymond, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The abstraction provided by virtual memory is central to the operation of modern operating systems. Making the most efficient use of the available translation hardware is critical to achieving high performance. The multiple page-size support provided by almost all architectures promises considerable benefits but poses a number of implementation challenges.  This thesis presents a minimally-invasive approach to transparent multiple page-size support for Itanium Linux. In particular, it examines the interaction between supporting large pages and Itanium's two inbuilt hardware page-table walkers; one being a virtual linear page-table with limited support for storing different page-size translations and the other a more flexible but higher overhead hash table based translation cache.  Compared to a single-page-size kernel, a range of benchmarks show performance improvements when multiple page-sizes are available, generally large working sets that stress the TLB. However, other benchmarks are negatively impacted. Analysis shows that the increased TLB coverage, resulting from the use of large pages, frequently does not reduce TLB miss rates sufficiently to make up for the increased cost of TLB reloads. These results, which are specific to the Itanium architecture, suggest that large-page support for Itanium Linux is best enabled selectively with insight into application behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Superpage</field><field name="subject">Itanium</field><field name="subject">Large-Page</field><field name="subject">Linux</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determinants of supervisory risk ratings of Australian deposit-taking institutions</field><field name="creator">Coleman, Anthony Dale Franklin, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">A key feature of best practice prudential supervision of financial institutions is the use of a risk rating system to formalise the outcome of supervisory reviews and ongoing monitoring processes. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) implemented the Probability and Impact Rating System (PAIRS) in 2002. Given the favourable economic conditions in which PAIRS was developed and has so far operated, any form of validation using backtesting methods is prevented. Consequently, this thesis seeks to develop a framework with which to evaluate and better understand the PAIRS risk rating system for authorised deposit-taking institutions. Specifically, we specify and estimate models in which the risk ratings are related to the statistical data that supervisors have access to when forming their expert judgement assessments of the PAIRS risk components. Whereas prior studies have generally focused on the overall supervisory rating, we model the primary components of the PAIRS rating (inherent risk, management and control risk, and capital support risk) as well as the aggregate risk of failure rating. Using a sample of ratings from 2002 to 2006, we find that the statistical data is able to explain much of the variability in ratings for credit unions and building societies (CUBS) and Australian and foreign subsidiary banks but not foreign bank branches. As expected, the regressions are stronger for inherent risk and capital support risk ratings than management and control risk ratings. However, supervisors?? consideration of adverse qualitative factors adds considerable explanatory power to a model based solely on statistical data, particularly for management and control risk ratings. We also model the determinants of supervisory exceptions and capital adequacy breaches over 1992 to 2006 and find that the risk indicators associated with a higher likelihood of an exception and/or breach are generally consistent with the risk indicators associated with supervisory risk ratings.  The outcomes of the thesis have a number of policy implications and practical applications. For example, the estimated models have the potential to be used as a quality and consistency tool to detect rating outliers within PAIRS. We also propose some improvements to APRA??s exception reporting system for CUBS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deposit-taking institutions</field><field name="subject">prudential supervision</field><field name="subject">risk ratings</field><field name="subject">Banks and banking</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations on beta 2-glycoprotein I and antiphospholipid antibodies</field><field name="creator">Giannakopoulos, Bill, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">An outline of the work contained in this thesis is presented. The first chapter is a critical review of the literature pertaining to the pathophysiological mechanisms operational with regards to the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The syndrome is characterised by venous and arterial thrombosis, and recurrent fetal loss, in association with the persistent presence of antibodies targeting the main autoantigen beta 2-glycoprotein I (&#946;2GPI). The second chapter reviews the literature delineating the diverse physiological functions of &#946;2GPI, and then relates them to its role in our current understanding of the pathophysiology of APS. The third chapter presents a critical review of the evidence base for the diagnosis and management of APS. The fourth chapter describes the interaction between &#946;2GPI and the glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIb&#945;) subunit of the platelet receptor GPIb-IX-V. GPIb&#945; is an important platelet adhesion receptor, which mediates multiple additional functions on the platelet surface, including binding coagulation factor XI (FXI). The implication of the interaction between &#946;2GPI and GPIb&#945; on platelet activation and the release of thromboxane in the presence of anti-&#946;2GPI antibodies is explored, as well as the intracellular pathways via which this activation occurs. The relevance of these findings to understanding APS pathogenesis, in particular thrombosis, is discussed. The fifth chapter delineates the interaction between the fifth domain of &#946;2GPI and FXI and its activated form factor XIa (FXIa). The ability of FXIa to cleave &#946;2GPI between lysine (Lys) 317 and threonine (Thr) 318, and modulate its function is reported.   The sixth chapter describes the ability of &#946;2GPI to inhibit FXIa autoproteolytic hydrolysis at the specific FXIa residues arginine (Arg) 507, Arg532 and Lys539. This interaction with &#946;2GPI stabilizes FXIa activity over time, and leads to enhanced FXIa mediated fibrin formation. This is a novel physiological function of &#946;2GPI with important implications. Recent epidemiological studies by others have emphasized the critical role of FXIa in pathological thrombus propagation. The seventh chapter defines the relevance of the FXIa residues Arg507, Arg532 and Lys539 to FXIa mediated inactivation by the main FXIa inhibitor Protease Nexin 2 (PN2), and by Antithrombin III (ATIII).           Insights into future directions for research are presented and discussed within each individual chapter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beta 2-glycoprotein I</field><field name="subject">Antiphospholipid syndrome</field><field name="subject">Phospholipid antibodies</field><field name="subject">Antiphospholipid syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Riding for the disabled: an analysis of the experiences and perceptions of riders and their parents</field><field name="creator">Dinning, Brooke Louise, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The benefits of horse riding for people with disabilities have been recognised for centuries, however, there has been very little research that explores the significance and meaning of Riding for the Disabled (RDA) for riders and there are no studies of parents of riders. This thesis is based upon ethnography and interviews with riders and riders' parents at a Riding for the Disabled Centre in Sydney, Australia. It explores the perceptions and experiences of riders and also analyses the role of parents in influencing their child's experience of the RDA. It examines parents' experiences of the RDA and the impact that it has had on them and their family. This thesis is premised on three research questions. The three questions are; 'how do riders perceive and experience the RDA and how and why do these perceptions differ?', 'how do parents perceive the RDA and its impact on their child with an impairment' and 'how do parents perceive the RDA's impact on their family and themselves?'  The study draws on a feminist framework and utilises the work of feminist theorists working in Disability Studies to 'broaden' the social model of disability. This framework facilitates the exploration of personal experiences of riding as it privileges the voice of the participants and also acknowledges the diversity of RDA experiences that exist amongst them. It also allows room for the physical, bodily experience of riding to be investigated. Furthermore, this research responds to Shakespeare's (2006) call for further research on the 'social relations of disability' - it investigates the relationships between volunteers who do not have an impairment, and the riders who have an impairment. The central argument that emerges is that Riding for the Disabled is a unique individual experience that holds varied meanings for riders. For some Riding for the Disabled is a central feature of their lives and has altered their world. For others, it is one activity among many and its impact is limited. The type of impairment an individual rider had was often a key determinant of how they experienced the RDA. For parents of riders the RDA exposes them to parents with similar experiences and enables practical knowledge and information to be exchanged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Riding for the disabled.</field><field name="subject">Disability studies.</field><field name="subject">Coaching (Transportation)</field><field name="subject">Horsemanship.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Troubling spaces: The politics of ???New??? community-based guerrilla performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Caines, Rebecca , English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the politics of twenty-first century ???guerrilla??? performance. It historicises site-specific, political performance by examining ???guerrilla??? art forms from the 1960s to the present. It argues that recent community-based, site-specific performance events can be seen as a ???new??? type of guerrilla work, as they utilise techniques which challenge public space, authorship and control without resorting to traditional guerrilla forms of didactic street protest.  The author establishes two main political tactics of the community-based guerrilla artist. The first is the utilisation of a problematised definition of ???community??? and the second is an understanding of physical, conceptual and experiential ???space??? as open to intervention. Community-based performance and site-specific art practices are investigated and space and community are placed into critical theoretical frameworks using post-structural and spatiality theory. The author then argues that post-structured communities which are based on an ethics of difference can trouble and create site, conceptual space and place (site/concept/place) through contemporary guerrilla performance events.  Three examples of community-based guerrilla performance in Australia are examined. The first case study explores Western Sydney based Urban Theatre Projects and their 1997 performance event TrackWork. The second focuses on community-based hip-hop artist Morganics and his facilitation of two hip-hop tracks Down River and The Block in 2001. The third considers US theatre director Peter Sellars??? problematic curation of the 2002 Adelaide Festival of the Arts. In all three case studies, guerrilla artists are shown working with post-structured communities to challenge and trouble site/concept/place in order to improve the lives of their participants and audiences. This thesis proposes new post-structural frameworks for the powerful presence of community and site in performance events, thus contributing to performance and cultural studies and to the emerging field of community-based performance scholarship.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance.</field><field name="subject">Artists and community -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular expression analyses of mice treated with antipsychotic drugs</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Carlotta, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population. The main treatments for schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs that target dopamine receptors, yet the underlying biological mechanisms through which they alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia remain ill defined. In this study, we used microarray analysis to profile the expression changes of thousands of genes simultaneously, following antipsychotic drug treatment of mice. Mice were treated chronically (28 days), or for a novel intermediate time-point (7 days), with one of three antipsychotic drugs: clozapine, haloperidol or olanzapine. The use of three drugs enabled us to discern antipsychotic-specific effects co-regulated by multiple drugs, rather than the side effects of individual compounds. Transcript profiling and validation by quantitative PCR of whole brain tissue revealed antipsychotic drug regulation of genes in diverse biological pathways, including: dopamine metabolism, neuropeptide and second-messenger signalling, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, cell adhesion, myelination, and voltage-gated ion channels. The regulation of voltage-gated channels by antipsychotic drugs has been suggested previously by electrophysiological studies, although thorough analysis has not been undertaken in vivo. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to characterise the regional mRNA and protein expression of two genes altered by multiple APDs, the voltage-gated potassium channel ??-subunit (Kcna1) and voltage-gated potassium channel interacting protein (Kchip3). Regional characterisation and expression analyses were carried out by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridisation, and Western blot analysis of mouse brain regions of interest to schizophrenia and its treatment. Following 7-day haloperidol treatment we observed up-regulation of Kcna1 in the striatum and dentate gyrus, with increased protein in the striatum, hippocampus and midbrain; and down-regulation of Kchip3 in the striatum, with decreased protein in the cortex, hippocampus and midbrain. These studies implicate voltage-gated potassium channels in the antipsychotic drug regulation of midbrain dopaminergic neuronal activity, adult neurogenesis and/or striatothalamic GABAergic neuronal inhibition. These findings indicate that regulation of potassium channels may underlie some of the mechanisms of action of antipsychotic drugs, and that voltage-gated ion channels may provide alternative drug targets for the treatment of schizophrenia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mouse brain</field><field name="subject">Antipsychotic drugs</field><field name="subject">Microarray analysis</field><field name="subject">Potassium channels</field><field name="subject">Mice as laboratory animals</field><field name="subject">Molecular genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular insights into the biological role / mechanisms of GATA-4 and FOG-2 in normal cardiac function and in cardiac hypertrophy.</field><field name="creator">Philips, Alana Sara, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The regulation of cardiac-specific genes such as GATA-4 and its co-factor FOG-2 is paramount for normal heart development and function. Indeed, those mechanisms that regulate GATA-4 and FOG-2 function, such as nuclear transport and the post-translational modification of SUMOylation, are of critical importance for cardiogenesis. Therefore the aims of this study were to: i) elucidate the nuclear transport mechanisms of GATA-4; ii) determine the function of SUMOylation on the biological activity of both GATA-4 and FOG-2; and iii) examine how these mechanisms impact on the role of GATA-4 and FOG-2 in cardiac hypertrophy.  Firstly, we characterised a non-classical nuclear localisation signal that mediates active import of GATA-4 in both HeLa cells and cardiac myocytes. Fine mapping studies revealed four crucial residues within this region that interacted with importin ?? to mediate GATA-4 import via the non-classical import pathway. In addition, a cardiac myocyte-specific CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal, which consists of three essential leucine residues, was identified. We also investigated the residues of GATA-4 that are responsible for its DNAbinding activity and therefore transcriptional control of cardiac-specific genes. Secondly, we demonstrated that SUMOylation of both GATA-4 and FOG-2 is exclusively carried out by SUMO-2/3. Moreover, SUMOylation is involved in the nuclear localisation of both GATA-4 and FOG-2 in cardiac myocytes as well as the transcriptional regulation of cardiac-specific genes, such as cardiac troponin I. Finally, and perhaps most biologically significant, we showed that nuclear transport as well as SUMOylation of GATA-4 is imperative for the ability of GATA-4 to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, it was determined that FOG-2 SUMOylation is involved in the ability of FOG-2 to protect against cardiac hypertrophy.  In conclusion, the current study provides detailed information on the nuclear transport pathways of GATA-4 as well as the SUMOylation of both GATA-4 and FOG-2 and the role these two mechanisms play in gene transcription and cardiac hypertrophy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac hypertrophy.</field><field name="subject">GATA-4.</field><field name="subject">Nuclear transport.</field><field name="subject">SUMOylation.</field><field name="subject">FOG-2.</field><field name="subject">Genes.</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Hypertrophy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of epiphytic bacteria on the marine red alga Delisea pulchra</field><field name="creator">Longford, Sharon Rae, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bacteria are ubiquitous to marine living surfaces, taking on a broad spectrum of roles from mutualistic to pathogenic. Despite their universality, much remains unknown about their basic ecology and interactions with higher organisms. To address this gap, this thesis firstly examines the bacterial communities associated with three co-occurring marine eukaryote hosts from temperate Australia: the demosponge Cymbastela concentrica, the subtidal red macroalga Delisea pulchra and the intertidal green macroalga Ulva australis. Molecular characterisation of the bacterial communities was undertaken using 16S rRNA gene library analysis to compare within-host (alpha) and between-host (beta) diversity for the three microbial communities. This study highlights the potentially substantial contribution host-associated microorganisms could have on marine microbial diversity. The remaining focus for this thesis was on the bacterial community associated with D. pulchra. This alga produces a suite of biologically active secondary metabolites (furanones) that non-toxically inhibit acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-driven quorum sensing in bacteria, affecting a range of phenotypes including colonisation and virulence traits. The ecology of D. pulchra???s epiphytic bacteria was investigated using a mechanistic approach to explain bacterial colonisation patterns. In particular, concepts and models of ecological succession founded in eukaryote ecology were investigated. The thesis concludes with a study investigating the effect of furanones and elevated temperature on bacteria-induced disease and thallus bleaching of D. pulchra. In the presence of furanones colonisation and infection of two Roseobacter isolates from D. pulchra???s epiphytic bacterial community were inhibited. Ruegeria strain R11 was demonstrated to have temperature regulated virulence, which caused thallus bleaching in furanone-free algae. The implications of elevated sea temperatures resulting from global warming for algal health are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Succession.</field><field name="subject">Delisea pulchra.</field><field name="subject">Epiphytic bacteria.</field><field name="subject">Bacterial community ecology.</field><field name="subject">Epiphytes.</field><field name="subject">Bacteria.</field><field name="subject">Ecology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential features of intrusive memories in depression and the role of cognitive avoidance in intrusion maintenance</field><field name="creator">Williams, Alishia , Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although recent research has demonstrated that intrusive memories of negative autobiographical events are an overlapping cognitive feature of depression and PTSD, there is still a general paucity of research investigating the prevalence and maintenance of these memories in depression. Accordingly, the current thesis represented a much-needed program of empirically-driven research that delineated the cognitive processes that underpin the manifestation, experience, and persistence of intrusive memories in depression. Firstly, Study 1 used descriptive and correlational methodologies to outline the content and features of these memories, and explored whether intrusion characteristics linked to intrusive memories in PTSD are also features of intrusive memories in depression. In accord with studies in PTSD samples, sensory features accounted for unique variance in the prediction of depression severity, over and above that accounted for by intrusion frequency. This commonality raised the possibility that cognitive management strategies linked to the persistence of intrusive memories in PTSD may also play a role in depression. Accordingly, Study 2 utilized a cross-sectional and prospective design to investigate whether negative appraisals and cognitive avoidance strategies, which are key to the persistence of intrusive memories in PTSD, similarly play a role in depression. The results demonstrated that assigning negative appraisals to one???s intrusive memory, and attempts to control the memory, were positively associated with intrusion-related distress, level of depression, and cognitive avoidance mechanisms. Additionally, negative appraisals and the use of cognitive mechanisms were predictive of depression concurrently, but not prospectively. Studies 3, 4, and 5 further investigated avoidant intrusion- response strategies by assessing the role of recall vantage perspective in mediating the effects of intrusion-related distress. Study 3 found that although field memories were not experienced as more distressing than observer memories, the results supported an association between an observer vantage perspective and cognitive avoidance mechanisms. As this study employed a correlational design, Study 4 addressed the question of directionality by experimentally manipulating mode of recall to ascertain whether shifting participants into a converse perspective would have differential effects on the reported experience of their intrusive memory. Results indicated that shifting participants from a field to an observer perspective resulted in decreased experiential ratings; specifically, reduced distress and vividness and increased detachment and observation. Also, as anticipated, the converse shift in perspective (from observer to field) did not lead to a corresponding increase in experiential ratings, but resulted in reduced ratings of observation. Study 5 attempted to investigate the stability of this memory orientation phenomenon by investigating mode of recall vantage perspective prospectively. Attrition of participants across the 12-month study limited analyses to the descriptive level, but illustrated that, at least for some individuals, recall vantage perspective remained stable across assessments periods. Collectively, the findings supported the notion that recall perspective has a functional role in the regulation of intrusion-related distress and represents a cognitive avoidance mechanism. Studies 6 and 7 employed experimental methodologies to investigate whether adopting an abstract/analytical mode of processing following a negative event would result in poor emotional processing, or increased distress associated with intrusive memories. Study 6 found no differences in either intrusion frequency or associated levels of distress across the processing conditions, as hypothesized. The results of Study 6 suggested that the predicted effects of ruminative self-focus on intrusion severity may be dependent upon the self-referential nature of the material being processed. Results of Study 7 indicated that inducing an analytical ruminative mode of processing resulted in participants rating their naturally occurring, self-referential intrusive memories as more negative, more distressing, and evoking a more negative emotional response compared to inducing distraction. Taken together, Studies 6 and 7 suggest the possibility that depressed individuals may get caught up in a ruminative cycle that, due to the documented effects of analytical self-focus, may exacerbate the emotional response elicited by the intrusions and perpetuate biased attentional focus towards them. Finally, Studies 8 and 9 explored suppression as a cognitive avoidance mechanism and addressed some methodological concerns regarding the measurement of this construct. Study 8 investigated the effects of repeated suppression using a method to index the frequency, duration, and associated levels of distress of an experimentally-induced intrusive memory, and assessed whether any observed effects were differentially linked to depressive symptomatology. Results supported a secondary rebound effect in those participants who were most successful at suppressing target intrusions. Study 9 was an investigation of the English version of the TCAQ (Luciano, Algarabel, Tom??s, &amp; Mart??nez, 2005), an index of cognitive control. Study 9 evaluated the association between this measure and performance on a thought suppression task. The results indicated that low TCAQ-20 scorers experienced intrusions of a longer duration and rated these intrusions as more distressing than high TCAQ-20 scorers, supporting the validity of the measure. These findings highlight the role of suppression as a maladaptive mental control strategy and the potential for elevated intrusion-distress to perpetuate its use. Together, the findings of this program of research confirm the importance of intrusive memories in depression, and underscore the need for an empirically-supported model to account for the occurrence and maintenance of these memories.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive avoidance</field><field name="subject">Intrusive memories</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance evaluation of ETX on  grid based wireless mesh networks</field><field name="creator">Ni, Xian, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the past few years Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have developed as a promising technology to provide flexible and low-cost broadband network services. The Expected Transmission Count (ETX) routing metric has been put forward recently as an advanced routing metric to provide high QoS for static WMNs. Most previous research in this area suggests that ETX outperforms other routing metrics in throughput and efficiency. However, it has been determined that ETX is not immune to load sensitivity and route oscillations in a single radio environment. Route oscillations refer to the situation where packet transmission switches between two or more routes due to congestion. This has the effect of degrading performance of the network, as the routing protocol may select a non optimal path. In this thesis we avoided the route oscillation problem by forcing data transmission on fixed routes. This can be implemented in the AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) protocol by disabling both error messages and periodic updating messages (the HELLO scheme). However, a critical factor for our approach is that ETX must determine a high quality initial route in AODV. This thesis investigates whether the ETX metric improves initial route selection in AODV compared to the HOPS metric in two representative client-server applications: the Traffic Control Network (TCN) and the Video Stream (VS) network. We evaluate the ETX and HOPS metrics in a range of scenarios which possess different link qualities and different traffic loads. We find the ETX metric greatly improves initial route selection in AODV compared to the HOPS in the network in which only single flow exists. For networks in which there are multiple simultaneous flows, ETX behaves similar to HOPS in initial route selection. Based on these results, we find the solution of route stabilization to route oscillations in the context of ETX is only useful in the single flow case. To address this problem, we propose a modified solution of repeatedly broadcasting RREQ (Route Request) packets. Simulation results show that our modified solution allows ETX to be useful in the initial route selection in both single flow and multiple simultaneous flows cases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Routing, WMNs, ETX</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Routers (Computer networks)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering antibodies against  complex platelet  antigens using phage display technology</field><field name="creator">De Leon, Ellen Jane, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Platelets are small anucleate cell fragments found in blood whose physiological role is important in maintaining haemostasis. In vivo, platelet surface glycoproteins mediate the mechanistic roles of platelets, and polymorphic changes to these glycoproteins have been observed to have significant effects on the platelet cellular function and such changes may include over-expression, under-expression and antigenicity of the protein. Human platelet antigens (HPA) are a result of polymorphic differences in platelet surface glycoproteins which have been found to be variably expressed in the population. Foetal maternal alloimmune thrombocytopaenia (FMAIT) is a condition that is observed in the unborn foetus and neonates due to HPA incompatibility between the mother and the foetus. HPA incompatibility accounts for a majority of severe thrombocytopaenic cases in neonates, and delayed diagnosis and treatment of such a condition often lead to intracranial haemorrhage. The risk in neonates diagnosed with FMAIT becomes increasingly significant in cases where intra-uterine (during pregnancy) platelet transfusion is the only effective therapeutic option. There are currently no antenatal screening programs for this condition, and laboratory diagnosis of FMAIT relies on the detection of maternal alloantibodies and parental HPA typing. For these reasons a significant amount of research is currently being invested into the isolation of recombinant antibodies with specific reactivity against FMAIT-related platelet antigens. Stable and specific recombinant platelet antibodies have great potential as a diagnostic agent in antenatal screening and broad-scale HPA typing of blood donors for platelet transfusion. Further characterisation of the isolated antibody may lead to a possible therapeutic agent. Studies by previous researchers have shown that the traditional methods (ie. Mouse monoclonal and EBV transformation) of obtaining monoclonal antibodies against FMAIT-related antigens have proven unsuccessful. The continuing progress in the discipline of phage display has produced several novel antibodies against self and non-self antigens. A further advantage in the application of phage display technology for the isolation of novel antibodies is the easy transition from bacterial to mammalian expression for the characterisation of glycosylated antibodies. The main focus of this project was to create and isolate a recombinant human anti-HPA-3a antibody using phage display for its possible application as a therapeutic or diagnostic agent.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phae display.</field><field name="subject">Human platelet antigens.</field><field name="subject">Antigen-antibody reactions.</field><field name="subject">Platelet activating factor.</field><field name="subject">Bacteriophages.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double jeopardy: occupational injury and rehabilitation of temporary agency workers</field><field name="creator">Underhill, Elsa, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the occupational health and safety risks facing labour hire employees (also known as temporary agency workers) in the Australian state of Victoria. Three questions are considered. First do labour hire employees face greater risk of injury and disease than direct hire employees? Second, if so, which characteristics of labour hire employment contribute to a higher rate of injury? Third, what characteristics of labour hire employment reduce the likelihood of injured employees returning to work and being rehabilitated?  The first question is answered by an aggregate analysis of data drawn from all workers' compensation claim files in Victoria between 1994/5 and 2000/1 contrasting the frequency of injury for both temporary agency employees and direct hire employees. Second a unique sub sample of individual investigated claim files was then examined to test employment factors that could account for the higher frequency of injury amongst agency workers. A third data source involved a survey and focus groups of temporary agency workers. This provided supplementary data on the work experiences of labour hire employees.  A number of conclusions are drawn. Labour hire employees are more likely to be injured at work than their direct hire counterparts. Factors explaining this include economic pressures, disorganisation at the host workplace, and regulatory failure for agency employees. Several of these factors are uniquely related to the triangular nature of labour hire arrangements. Once injured at work, labour hire employees are especially disadvantaged relative to direct hire employees through the reluctance of many labour hire employers to offer further employment. This reduces the capacity of labour hire workers to return to meaningful employment. Regulatory failure stemming from both employment and occupational health and safety legislation underpins the greater likelihood of agency workers being injured at work and then dispensed with by employers. Until the uniqueness of their triangular relationship with employers and hosts is recognised through appropriate regulatory intervention, their greater occupational health and safety risks will not be overcome.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workplace injury.</field><field name="subject">Temporary agency workers.</field><field name="subject">Occupational health and safety.</field><field name="subject">Return to work.</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance: issues related to executive compensation, corporate boards and institutional investor monitoring</field><field name="creator">Smith, Gavin Stuart, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains five research projects within the context of two distinctive issues that concern the effectiveness of executive compensation in aligning executive interests with shareholders and how institutional investors play a role in structuring corporate governance mechanisms. The objective of this dissertation is to first determine how institutions should exert their influence if they are serious about alleviating agency problems and improving firm performance. Second, the thesis seeks to determine whether institutional investors use their influence to shape executive compensation and corporate governance mechanisms in a manner consistent with aligning managerial interests with shareholders and increasing shareholder wealth. The thesis finds that CEOs with option incentives increase the likelihood that a firm will increase risk by undertaking both major real investments and acquisitions. Moreover, CEO option grants are positively related to measures of firm valuation and operating performance suggesting option incentives are an important mechanism to align CEO interests with shareholders. This is robust to alternative measures of firm valuation and operating performance, also various estimation techniques. Using these findings to motivate the direction of institutional influence on executive compensation, it is found that institutional investors, particularly smaller activist traders, significantly increase option grant incentives received by executives. Institutional influence also raises CEO pay which is consistent with preservation of reservation CEO utility levels. Addressing the role of institutional investors in the context of other corporate governance mechanisms, it is found that institutional investor influence is also negatively related to board size and positively related to board independence, which is achieved by removal of inside directors. Such actions are consistent with empirical studies that show smaller boards and increased levels of independent directors improve firm performance and board decision making.  The main conclusion from this dissertation is that option incentives are an effective mechanism to align CEO interests with those of shareholders. Institutional investors appear to recognise this importance, and effectively use their influence to increase options received by executives. Combined with institutional investors putting in place corporate boards that provide better oversight of management, institutional investors appear to be effective monitors of the firms in which they invest.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Institutional Investors</field><field name="subject">Corporate Governance</field><field name="subject">Executive Compensation</field><field name="subject">Compensation management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of exercise-based lifestyle interventions on cardiovascular reactivity of untrained premenopausal women</field><field name="creator">Park, Young Jin, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Three studies were designed to investigate the effects of exercise-based lifestyle interventions including diet change and exercise training on cardiovascular and autonomic responses to various physical and mental challenges in untrained premenopausal women. In Study 1, the effects of different tasks designed to activate the sympathetic nervous system on autonomic control of cardiovascular functioning such as the Stroop colour-word task (Stroop) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in 20 untrained premenopausal women (22.6??0.7 years) were determined. In Study 2, a longitudinal exercise intervention strategy was used with 18 untrained premenopausal women (22.5??0.7 years) in order to investigate the effect of 15 weeks of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) training on cardiac autonomic responses to mental challenge (Stroop) and LBNP. In Study 3, the effects of HIIE training combined with a Mediterranean-style eating plan and fish oil supplement (Fish oil, Exercise, Mediterranean diet; FEM) on cardiovascular function during mental challenge (Stroop) and physical tasks (handgrip and reactive hyperaemia) were examined in 32 overweight untrained premenopausal women (22.0??0.6 years).                     In these studies, forearm blood flow (FBF) was assessed using Hokanson Plethysmography with the venous occlusion technique. The surface electrocardiogram and continuous beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure were also monitored. Peak oxygen uptake was assessed using open-circuit spirometry (True Max 2400, ParvoMedics). In addition, body composition was measured using DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; DPX-IQ, Lunar Radiation).	Results from Study 1 indicate that FBF response to mental challenge in young females was smaller compared to previously obtained data from age-matched males. Furthermore, this FBF response to mental challenge was negatively correlated to insulin resistance estimated by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) (r = - .52, p &lt; .05). In addition, when cardiopulmonary baroreceptors were unloaded by a mild level of LBNP (-20 mmHg) during Stoop, FBF response to mental challenge (vasodilation) was abolished suggesting a large dependency of vasodilation response during mental challenge on cardiopulmonary baroreflex.	After 15 weeks of supervised HIIE training, aerobic fitness improved (p &lt; .05) whereas percent of body fat was significantly decreased (p &lt; .05). In addition, recovery BP following Stroop was significantly reduced. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was marginally decreased (p = .056).  Women who had higher insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) lost less fat than women with lower HOMA-IR (r = .60, p = .088). In addition, change in FBF during Stroop after training was directly related to pretest insulin resistance levels (r = .68, p &lt; .05). Therefore, HIIE training had a normalising effect on FBF response to mental challenge. PEP/LVET ratio at rest and during LBNP was also significantly increased in women with higher HOMA-IR suggesting a reduction in cardiac contractility via a decrease in sympathetic stimulation (r = .62, p = .076, r = .62, p = .75 respectively). 	In Study 3 results indicated that 12 weeks of the FEM trial significantly reduced percent of body fat (p &lt; .001), fasting insulin (p &lt; .05), interleukin-6 (p &lt; .05) and cortisol (p  &lt; .05), and significantly improved aerobic fitness ( ; p &lt; .001). With respect to cardiovascular and cardiac autonomic measures, rate pressure product (RPP) was significantly reduced at rest (p &lt; .05) and during recovery after Stoop (p &lt; .05), suggesting decreased myocardial oxygen consumption. In addition, baseline heart rate determined in the sitting position was significantly reduced (p &lt; .05), while both baseline high frequency power (HF) determined in supine (p &lt; .01) and cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) determined in the sitting position (p &lt; .05) were increased after the FEM trial. In addition, BRS determined during mental challenge also marginally increased (p = .051).	In summary, lifestyle intervention including HIIE training, Mediterranean-style eating plan, and a fish oil supplement significantly enhanced parasympathetic influence of the heart and improved fitness, blood profiles, and body composition.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical and mental challenges</field><field name="subject">Exercise-based lifestyle interventions</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular and autonomic response</field><field name="subject">Lifestyles</field><field name="subject">Perimenopause</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photography  as a method of  visual sociology: An investigation of the potential of still photography  as a method of visual sociology</field><field name="creator">Campion, Britta Maree, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ever since the camera was invented people have been using it as a tool to reflect and record the world around them. Photographic images have great potential to investigate different social practices and phenomena in the world.  Photography, in its own right, is an extremely large area of study. Despite its relatively short history, photography has undergone a broad and complex evolution since it was invented in 1840. This paper does not aim to cover the comprehensive history of the development of photography in its many facets, it aims however to concentrate on a specific area of what has come to be termed visual sociology and the potential of the still photographic image as a primary tool within the field.  Visual sociology is a marginal, experimental area of sociology, it is a field which has not been given due consideration by many sociologists due to its unscientific nature and one which remains unfamiliar to many social documentary photographers.  This paper traces the history of visual sociology and explores its roots and links with social documentary photography. It explores the established methods of visual data collection that are utilised within the field of visual sociology. It also explores a further sub-discipline, urban sociology and the role of the image in investigation of urban phenomena.  The resulting practical component of this research is an extensive urban photographic investigation shot over the period of one month in the city of Tokyo. The resulting series of images exist as a type of photographic visual map of &#145;city creatures&#146; ubiquitous in the urban environment. The series aims to constitute as a visual, cultural survey about an aspect of social life within the Japanese urban context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">documentary</field><field name="subject">photography</field><field name="subject">visual sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiconducting properties of polycrystalline titanium dioxide</field><field name="creator">Burg, Tristan Kevin, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Titanium dioxide, TiO2, has potential applications as a photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical generation of hydrogen by splitting water using solar energy and as a photocatalyst for water purification. This study is part of the UNSW research program to process TiO2-based oxide semiconductors as high-performance photoelectrodes and photocatalysts. This study investigates the effect of defect disorder on semiconducting properties of polycrystalline TiO2.  This study involved the processing of high-purity polycrystalline TiO2 and determination of its semiconducting properties through measurement of electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power at elevated temperatures (1073-1323K) in controlled oxygen activities [1x10-13 Pa &lt; p(O2) &lt; 75 kPa].  The study included two types of experiments: Determination of electrical properties under conditions of gas/solid equilibrium. The data obtained was used to derive defect disorder and related semiconducting properties Monitoring of electrical properties during equilibration. This data was used to determine the chemical diffusion coefficient.  The data obtained under equilibrium conditions indicates that oxygen may be used as a dopant to impose controlled semiconducting properties. In reduced conditions TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor and under oxidizing conditions TiO2 is a p-type semiconductor. The n-type behaviour is associated with oxygen vacancies as the predominant defects and titanium interstitials as the minority defects. The p-type behaviour is closely related to titanium vacancies that are formed during prolonged oxidation. Charge transport at elevated temperature was shown to involve substantial contribution from ions.  Analysis of electrical properties enabled determination of several defect-related quantities including the activation enthalpy for oxygen vacancy formation, and the activation energy of the electrical conductivity components related to electrons, holes and ions.  The kinetic data obtained during gas/solid equilibration enabled determination of the chemical diffusion coefficient which exhibited a complex dependence on nonstoichiometry. In addition, prolonged oxidation showed that equilibration occurred in two kinetic regimes. One for highly mobile oxygen vacancies and titanium interstitials which quickly reached an ??operational equilibrium?? within hours and another slow kinetic regime for equilibration of titanium vacancies over many thousand hours. The determined chemical diffusion coefficient data may be used to select the processing conditions required to impose uniform concentration of defects within a TiO2.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">TiO2</field><field name="subject">Conductivity</field><field name="subject">Thermoelectric Power</field><field name="subject">Thermopower</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor</field><field name="subject">Defect</field><field name="subject">Polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On small time asymptotics of solutions of stochastic equations in infinite dimensions</field><field name="creator">Jegaraj, Terence Joseph, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the small time asymptotics of solutions of stochastic equations in infinite dimensions. In this abstract H denotes a separable Hilbert space, A denotes a linear operator on H generating a strongly continuous semigroup and (W(t))t???0 denotes a separable Hilbert space-valued Wiener process. In chapter 2 we consider the mild solution (Xx(t))t???[0,1] of a stochastic initial value problem dX = AX dt + dW t ??? (0, 1] X(0) = x ??? H , where the equation has an invariant measure ??. Under some conditions L(Xx(t)) has a density k(t, x, ??) with respect to ?? and we can find the limit limt???0 t ln k(t, x, y). For infinite dimensional H this limit only provides the lower bound of a large deviation principle (LDP) for the family of continuous trajectory-valued random variables { t ??? [0, 1] ??? Xx(??t) : ?? ??? (0, 1]}. In each of chapters 3, 4 and 5 we find an LDP which describes the small time asymptotics of the continuous trajectories of the solution of a stochastic initial value problem. A crucial role is played by the LDP associated with the Gaussian trajectory-valued random variable of the noise. Chapter 3 considers the initial value problem dX(t) = (AX(t) + F(t,X(t))) dt + G(X(t)) dW(t) t ??? (0, 1] X(0) = x ??? H, where drift function F(t, ??) is Lipschitz continuous on H uniformly in t ???

Chapter 4 considers an equation with dissipative drift function F defined on a separable Banach space continuously embedded in H; the solution has continuous trajectories in the Banach space. Chapter 5 considers a linear initial value problem with fractional Brownian motion noise. In chapter 6 we return to equations with Wiener process noise and find a lower bound for liminft???0 t ln P{X(0) ??? B,X(t) ??? C} for arbitrary L(X(0)) and Borel subsets B and C of H.

Vehicle tracking is used in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and surveillance systems. Its re- liability is critical to the overall performance of these systems. Feature-based methods that are used to represent distinctive content in visual frames are one approach to vehicle tracking. Existing feature-based tracking systems can only track vehicles under ideal conditions. They have difficulties when used under a variety of conditions, for example, during both the day and night. They are highly dependent on stable local features that can be tracked for a long time period. These local features are easily lost because of their local property and image noise caused by factors such as, headlight reflections and sun glare. This thesis presents a new approach, addressing the reliability issues mentioned above, tracking whole feature groups composed of feature points extracted with the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. A feature group in- cludes several features that share a similar property over a time period and can be tracked to the next frame by tracking individual feature points inside it. It is lost only when all of the features in it are lost in the next frame. We cre- ate these feature groups by clustering individual feature points using distance, velocity and acceleration information between two consecutive frames. These feature groups are then hierarchically clustered by their inter-group distance, velocity and acceleration information. Experimental results show that the pro- posed vehicle tracking system can track vehicles with the average accuracy of over 95%, even when the vehicles have complex motions in noisy scenes. It gen- erally works well even in difficult environments, such as for rainy days, windy days, and at night. We are surprised to find that our tracking system locates and tracks motor bikes and pedestrians. This could open up wider opportunities and further investigation and experiments are required to confirm the tracking performance for these objects. Further work is also required to track more com- plex motions, such as rotation and articulated objects with different motions on different parts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grouping</field><field name="subject">Vehicle Tracking</field><field name="subject">Local Features</field><field name="subject">Space vehicle -- Tracking</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The city that never sleeps</field><field name="creator">Furgang, Lynne Eva, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research documentation explores representations of the Holocaust in the visual arts in relation to the post-Holocaust ??ripple effect????the impact of the Holocaust on the world today, in both the wider arena of global political conflicts and in the lives of individuals. In the following chapters, I address the complex ethical and political aspects of representations of the Holocaust in the context of the evolution of Holocaust awareness and memorialisation. I also investigate recent developments in art and theory that challenge prevailing conventions governing Holocaust representation, especially how the relationship between the perceived political exploitation of the Holocaust and the intergenerational effects of Holocaust trauma is addressed.   Given these are sensitive and contentious issues I discuss my studio work in terms of how trauma affects the political rather than as an overt polemically/politically motivated art. I examine my attempts to bypass controversy (maintaining respect for victims and survivors), yet maintain engagement with these issues in my art. In doing this I aim to liberate both my art and the viewer from habits of perception in regard to the subject.  From this principle I propose a ??strategic?? form of self-censorship that paradoxically gives me the freedom to do this. This strategy enables me to create an art of ambiguity, which exists in an amoral zone. The art evokes reflective thought, uncertainty and ambivalence, where references to the Holocaust or political content are often not explicit, leaving room for lateral and open readings.   My work, which incorporates interdisciplinary methods, is often based on photographs from a variety of sources. I also create three dimensional constructions. The sourced images and the constructions are disguised, decontextualised, cropped, erased or digitally altered, and also experiment with optical illusion. Through transformative processes these images are changed into drawings, paintings, photographs.   This research documentation acknowledges the gap between the gravitas of the subject with its ethical and geo-political complexities and my idiosyncratic, subjective, introverted approach to making art. I conclude that there is potential in the exploration of an ??anxiety of representation?? in relation to the Holocaust in the contemporary context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contemporary art</field><field name="subject">Holocaust representation</field><field name="subject">Ambiguity</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Holocaust (Christian theology)</field><field name="subject">Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945), and art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unequal before the law: Questioning the distinction between types of armed conflict in international law</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Emily Jessica Teresa, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis makes the case for eliminating the distinction between types of armed conflict under international humanitarian law (IHL).  Currently, IHL makes the distinction between international and non-international armed conflicts.  International armed conflicts are regulated by more treaties than their non-international counterparts.  Furthermore, the regulation of international armed conflicts is also considerably more comprehensive than that offered for participants in and victims of non-international armed conflicts.  This bifurcation of the law was logical at the time the Geneva Conventions of 1949 were drafted and adopted, as the majority of armed conflicts prior to that point had been international in character.  However, in the years following the adoption of the Conventions, there has been a proliferation of non-international armed conflicts, which presents challenges to a body of law that has few tools to adequately address such occurrences.  The adoption of the Additional Protocols in 1977 went some way to addressing the legal lacunae that existed, but significant gaps still remain.  Mindful this history, this thesis tracks the growth and evolution of the laws of armed conflict in the modern era, since the first document of the laws of war produced for the American Civil War.  In doing so, this thesis demonstrates how the law of armed conflict has become increasingly harmonised in its application, with more rules of IHL being generally applicable in all instances of armed conflict, regardless of characterisation.  This thesis then makes the argument that the time has come for the final step to be taken, the elimination of the distinction between types of armed conflict, and the complete harmonisation of the laws of war.  Focusing specifically on the issue of combatants and POWs in armed conflicts, this thesis draws on considerable legal precedent, legal theory, and policy arguments to make the case that it is time for the law relating to the regulation of armed conflicts to be more uniformly applied.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Armed Conflict</field><field name="subject">International Humanitarian Law</field><field name="subject">International Law</field><field name="subject">War (International law)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aluminium smelting cell control and optimisation</field><field name="creator">Iffert, Martin , Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ideal aluminium smelting cell should operate at a fixed temperature and superheat. However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. Contrasting, in the long term, for mature cells the aluminium fluoride consumption is fairly accurately reflected by the soda and calcium oxide contents of the primary alumina. Therefore the poor control of aluminium fluoride concentration reflects the poor understanding of the causes of variation in aluminium fluoride concentration and molten bath mass within the cell. The aims of this thesis were to i.	Develop a better understanding of how the dynamics of the aluminium smelting process impact process conditions ??? hence bath chemistry ii.	Subsequently develop and evaluate diagnostic models that may be used to minimise the variations in chemistry in individual operating cells The key control feature to minimise adverse effects is Superheat. The ideal aluminium smelting cell should operate at a fixed temperature and superheat. However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. In this thesis industrial aluminium reduction cells and their material handling and dry scrubbing operation were analysed in respect to their energy and material balance. A number of experiments were carried out to study the influence of process parameters and operations on the state and path function of a cell. Bath inventory measurements lead to a better understanding of the underlying process behaviour, and it was obvious that energy and mass balance cannot be controlled independently. With regard to the response of bath inventory, bath and liquidus temperature to pot operation, the following interesting phenomena were identified: -	some cells are active or inactive with respect to their response to aluminium fluoride additions -	positive and negative voltage steps cause non-proportional changes in liquidus and bath temperatures -	the liquidus temperature, bath volume and composition can respond rapidly to changes due to alumina feeding Successful application of the results and understanding developed in this research resulted in an energy requirement reduction of 1 kWh/kg</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium smelting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Face emotion recognition in children and adolescents; effects of puberty and callous unemotional traits in a community sample</field><field name="creator">Merz, Sabine, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous research suggests that as well as behavioural difficulties, a small subset of aggressive and antisocial children show callous unemotional (CU) personality traits (i.e., lack of remorse and absence of empathy) that set them apart from their low-CU peers. These children have been identified as being most at risk to follow a path of severe and persistent antisocial behaviour, showing distinct behavioural patterns, and have been found to respond less to traditional treatment programs. One particular focus of this thesis is that emerging findings have shown emotion recognition deficits within both groups. Whereas children who only show behavioural difficulties (in the absence of CU traits) have been found to misclassify vague and neutral expressions as anger, the presence of CU traits has been associated with an inability to correctly identify fear and to a lesser extend, sadness. Furthermore, emotion recognition competence varies with age and development. In general, emotion recognition improves with age, but interestingly there is some evidence that it may become less efficient during puberty. No research could be located, however, that assessed emotion recognition through childhood and adolescence for children high and low on CU traits and antisocial behaviour.	The primary focus of this study was to investigate the impact of these personality traits and pubertal development on emotion recognition competence in isolation and in combination. A specific aim was to assess if puberty would exacerbate these deficits in children with pre-existing deficits in emotion recognition. The effect of gender, emotion type and measure characteristics, in particular the age of the target face, was also examined. A community sample of 703 children and adolescents aged 7-17 were administered the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire to assess adjustment, the Antisocial Process Screening Device to assess antisocial traits, and the Pubertal Development Scale was administered to evaluate pubertal stage. Empathy was assessed using the Bryant Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents. Parents or caregivers completed parent version of these measures for their children. Emotion recognition ability was measured using the newly developed UNSW FACES task (Dadds, Hawes &amp; Merz, 2004). Description of the development and validation of this measure are included.	Contrary to expectations, emotion recognition accuracy was not negatively affected by puberty. In addition, no overall differences in emotion recognition ability were found due to participant&#146;s gender or target face age group characteristics. The hypothesis that participants would be better at recognising emotions expressed by their own age group was therefore not supported. In line with expectations, significant negative associations between CU traits and fear recognition were found. However, these were small, and contrary to expectations, were found for girls rather than boys. Also, puberty did not exacerbate emotion recognition deficits in high CU children. However, the relationship between CU traits and emotion recognition was affected differently by pubertal status. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to future research into emotion recognition deficits within this population. In addition, theoretical and practical implications of these findings for the development of antisocial behaviour and the treatment of children showing CU traits are explored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Face emotion recognition</field><field name="subject">Antisocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Childhood</field><field name="subject">Puberty</field><field name="subject">Emotional problems of children</field><field name="subject">Emotional problems of teenagers</field><field name="subject">Adjustment disorders in children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of renal haemodynamics in the developing kidney - implications for fetal programming</field><field name="creator">Turner, Anita Jillian, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Renal blood flow and micropuncture studies were conducted in late gestation fetal sheep (gestational age 134 - 141 days; term 150 days) and neonatal lambs (8 - 18 days after birth) to study the forces involved in glomerular filtration (GFR) and characterize the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) system during development. These studies required the kidney to be immobilized so stable models in acutely prepared anaesthetized animals were developed. Fetuses were studied in a heated water bath exteriorized from the uterus but with an intact umbilical circulation. The lower GFR in fetuses than lambs was found to be due to both lower net filtration pressures (P&lt;0.001) and a lower ultrafiltration coefficient (P&lt;0.001). TGF was present at both ages, but in fetuses the sensitivity was higher (P&lt;0.001) and reactivity was lower (P&lt;0.001). The reduction in TGF sensitivity between fetal and neonatal life may facilitate the increase in renal blood flow and GFR which occurs at this time. In both fetuses and lambs the sensitivity of the TGF curve was reduced by volume expansion (P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.05) and reactivity was reduced in lambs (P&lt;0.001). Furosemide abolished TGF at both ages. In both fetuses and lambs, TGF reactivity was increased by inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS; P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.001) and in lambs, TGF sensitivity was increased (P&lt;0.01). This indicates that nitric oxide produced by the macula densa modulates TGF during development. In offspring destined to become hypertensive due to maternal dexamethasone treatment in early gestation TGF sensitivity tended to be enhanced in fetal life and was enhanced in lambs (P&lt;0.01). Increased TGF sensitivity may contribute to the development of hypertension in this model of developmental programming. The effects of nNOS inhibition were attenuated in these animals, suggesting that they have low tonic production of nitric oxide by the macula densa. In fetuses whose mothers had been subtotally nephrectomized prior to mating to induce maternal mild renal impairment, GFR was increased (P&lt;0.01) but net filtration pressure was reduced (P&lt;0.001) so the ultrafiltration coefficient was increased (P&lt;0.001). TGF sensitivity was normal and the effects of nNOS inhibition were similar to normal fetuses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">fetal programming</field><field name="subject">TGF</field><field name="subject">kidney</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural drive to human respiratory muscles</field><field name="creator">Saboisky, Julian Peter, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the organisation of drive to human upper airway and inspiratory pump muscles.  The characterisation of single motor unit activity is important as the discharge frequency or timing of discharge of each motor unit directly reflects the output of single motoneurones.  Thus, the firing properties of a population of motor units is indicative of the neural drive to the motoneurone pool.  The experiments presented in Chapter 2 measured the recruitment time of five inspiratory pump muscles (diaphragm, scalene, second parasternal intercostal, and third and fifth dorsal external intercostal muscles) during normal quiet breathing and quantified the timing and magnitude of drive reaching each muscle.  Chapter 3 examined the EMG activity of a major upper airway muscle (the genioglossus).  The single motor units of the genioglossus display activity that can be grouped into six types based on its association or lack of association with respiration.  The types of activity are termed: Inspiratory Phasic, Inspiratory Tonic, Expiratory Phasic, Expiratory Tonic, Tonic, and Tonic Other.  A new method is presented in Chapter 4 to illustrate large amounts of data from single motor units recorded from respiratory muscles in a concise manner.  This single figure displays for each motor unit, the recruitment time and firing frequency, the peak discharge frequency and its time, and the derecruitment time and its frequency.  This method, termed the time-and-frequency plot, is used to demonstrate differences in behaviour between populations of diaphragm (Chapter 2) and genioglossus (Chapter 3) motoneurones. In Chapter 5, genioglossus activity during quiet breathing is compared between a group of patients with severe OSA and healthy control subjects.   The distribution of central drive is identical between the OSA and control subjects with the same proportion of the six types of motor unit activity in both groups.  However, there are alterations in the onset time of Inspiratory Phasic and Inspiratory Tonic motor units in OSA subjects and their peak discharge rates are also altered.  Single motor unit action potentials in OSA subjects showed an increased area.  This suggests the presence of neurogenic changes and may provide a pathophysiological explanation for the increased multiunit electromyographic activity reported in OSA subjects during wakefulness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obstructive sleep apnoea</field><field name="subject">Motoneurones</field><field name="subject">Breathing</field><field name="subject">Time and Frequency Plot (TAFPLOT)</field><field name="subject">Genioglossus</field><field name="subject">Diaphragm</field><field name="subject">Scalene</field><field name="subject">Parasternal intercostal</field><field name="subject">Dorsal external intercostal</field><field name="subject">internal intercostal</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the audience in product placement: development of an audience engrossment scale</field><field name="creator">Scott, Jane Margaret, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Product placement is now a US$7.76 billion industry, flourishing as advertisers attempt to combat audience sophistication, zipping, zapping, muting of commercials, TiVo, media multi-tasking, the Internet and digital television, all of which may signal the death knell of the interruptive commercial model. Yet whilst research on product placement is growing, it has not kept pace with the practice, and many findings do not converge across studies. This is likely the case because parameters remain undefined and there is no operational framework to describe how product placements are processed, and no agreement as to what effects are possible or how they should be examined. Most effects-based research has focussed on executional factors and what the product placement does to the audience member. This assumes that the recipient is a passive participant. However this thesis argues that the audience member is actually an active processor who should be the focus of research.  This research distinguishes product placement from related activities and develops a new conceptual model of product placement processing. It puts a strong focus on the role of the audience member, stating that their level of familiarity of the placed brands, and their level of engrossment with the entertainment story will impact their recognition of product placements in that story. Applying Rasch Measurement Theory, an Audience Engrossment scale is developed and refined over four stages of data collection, with 1360 respondents across seven films, to capture the quality of people??s interaction with a film.  The result is a scale comprising 19 feeling items, 10 arousal items, 6 appraisal items and 7 cognitive effort items. The scale was then tested as part of the conceptual model, with 191 participants watching The Island and completing questionnaires after the film relating to their recognition of brands within the film and their level of engrossment. Brand familiarity information was collected four weeks earlier. Onset prominence, high plot connection, dual modality and use by star were found to have the strongest direct effects on recognition, with brand familiarity and the four audience engrossment dimensions generally found to interact with the product placement characteristics as hypothesised.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brandcasting</field><field name="subject">product placement</field><field name="subject">audience engrossment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increasing the ability of antibiotics to control S. aureus keratitis</field><field name="creator">Schubert, Tracey Lee, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microbial keratitis is a major cause of avoidable visual impairment worldwide with S. aureus a leading cause of this disease in humans. Recently S. aureus isolated from eye infections have exhibited resistance to many antibiotics with those isolates from more severe infections exhibiting higher rates of antibiotic resistance. New therapies are therefore needed to ensure adequate treatment for these infections. In microbial keratitis the hosts' immune response is responsible for significant disease pathology so development of a therapy which also targets the immune response would be beneficial. The fimbrolides produced by Delisea pulchra are potential candidates as they are both growth inhibitory and immunomodulatory in vitro. The antibiotic susceptibility of clinical S. aureus isolates from ocular infections was determined using the CDS method and similarity of these isolates determined by PFGE and PCR-ribotyping. In addition the effect of fimbrolides on bacterial growth alone or in combination with antibiotics and the immune response to bacterial stimulation in PMNs and HCE cells was determined. Fimbrolides were then topically applied to S. aureus corneal infections and the effect of these compounds on disease progression determined by assessing corneal pathology, bacterial numbers and PMNs recovered from infected corneas. A larger proportion of keratitis isolates exhibited resistance to antibiotics than conjunctivitis isolates. Keratitis isolates were also related within a geographical region. The fimbrolides inhibited bacterial growth and modulated the immune response to bacterial stimulation in vitro. These compounds also exhibited synergy with conventional antimicrobials. In combination with ciprofloxacin the fimbrolides reduced the clinical score and numbers of bacteria recovered from ciprofloxacin-resistant or ciprofloxacin-sensitive S. aureus corneal infections.  This thesis has identified that S. aureus isolates which produce the worst disease pathology in the eye are related and also exhibit higher rates of resistance to antibiotics indicating novel therapies to treat these infections are needed. This thesis demonstrated that fimbrolides inhibit S. aureus growth, exhibit synergy with antibiotics and modulate the immune response in vitro. In combination with ciprofloxacin the fimbrolides also improved disease pathology in keratitis, illustrating the potential of fimbrolides to be used as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of S. aureus keratitis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antibiotics.</field><field name="subject">Keratitis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quinolinic acid and its effect on the astrocyte with relevance to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer??s disease</field><field name="creator">Ting, Ka Ka, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is evidence that the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QUIN) synthesized through the kynurenine pathway (KP) by activated microglia may play a role in the pathogenesis of several major neuroinflammatory diseases and more particularly in Alzheimer??s disease (AD). The hypothesis of this project is QUIN affects the function and morphology of astrocytes. In this study I used human foetal astrocytes stimulated with AD associated cytokines including IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TGF-alpha and different concentrations of QUIN ranging from low physiological to high excitotoxic concentrations. I found that QUIN induces IL-1beta expression in human astrocytes and subsequently, contribute to the inflammatory cascade that is present in AD pathology. Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and vimentin protein expression were complementary in expression to each other after 24 hr stimulation with different QUIN doses. However, there were marked increases in GFAP levels and reduction in vimentin levels compared to controls with QUIN treatment indicating that QUIN can trigger astrogliosis in human astrocytes. Glutamine synthetase (GS) activity was used as a functional metabolic test for astrocytes and I found a dose-dependent inhibition of GS activity by QUIN. This inhibition was inversely correlated with iNOS expression whereby reduced GS activity is accompanied with an increase expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. These results suggest that reduction in GS activity can lead to accumulation of extracellular glutamate then leading to exacerbated excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor over-activation and ultimately neuronal death. PCR array results showed that at least four different pathways were activated with pathological concentration of QUIN including p38 MAPK that is associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine production, ERK/MAPK growth and differentiation that can modulate structural proteins, mitochondrial-induced apoptotic cascade and cell cycle control pathway. QUIN-induced astrogliosis and excitotoxicity could lead to glial scar formation and prevention of axonal growth thus exacerbation of neurodegeneration via synaptosomal NMDA receptor over-activation. All together, this study showed that, in the context of AD, QUIN is an important factor for astroglial activation, dysregulation and death, which can be mediated by the previously mentioned pathways.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Astrocytes</field><field name="subject">Quinolinic acid</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Excitotoxicity</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capability building for the manufacture of photovoltaic system components in developing countries</field><field name="creator">Bruce, Anna Gabrielle, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The manufacture of photovoltaic (PV) system components has a role to play in the industrialisation and poverty reduction strategies of developing countries. It has also been suggested that small scale local manufacture of balance of systems components has the potential to improve the maintenance, installation and use of the technology. However, PV is a complex technology and most developing countries have not been able to build the capabilities required to manufacture PV system components of an appropriate quality and price, either in the modern or small scale sectors. The factors that determine the success of PV manufacturers in developing countries are therefore of interest.  Previous studies on learning in the PV industry have been focused on industry-wide concerns and have not explicitly addressed enterprise-level capability building or challenges specific to developing countries. In particular, there has been very little published about small scale PV manufacture. This thesis therefore aims to improve understanding of the factors that influence capability building, with a view to assisting decision making in relation to PV manufacture in developing countries.  The aims of the study have been fulfilled by the development and assessment of a software simulation training tool for PV cell production line engineers, the development of an analysis framework, and application of it to several case study PV enterprises. Through the application of the framework to the case studies, it has been possible to assess the role of software simulations, the suitability of countries with different types of infrastructure for hosting PV manufacturing and the institutional arrangements or interventions that could be used to promote capability building for PV manufacturers in developing countries.  While further case studies are required to make more than tentative conclusions, the framework developed and tested in this thesis may now be used as a tool to systematically and rapidly analyse the appropriateness of different types of PV manufacture in particular countries, to identify the weaknesses in their PV technological systems and therefore to suggest where resources should be invested and where appropriate institutional changes could be made. The simulation software has been demonstrated to be an effective capability building tool, thus providing one of the key elements required for successful manufacturing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Manufacture.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaics.</field><field name="subject">Development.</field><field name="subject">Capability building.</field><field name="subject">Capacity building.</field><field name="subject">Technological systems.</field><field name="subject">Small-scale manufacture.</field><field name="subject">Simulation software.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic cells.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power generation -- Developing countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pricing and hedging derivative securities in a regime-switching model with state-dependent jumps</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michael Shou-Cheng, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we discuss option pricing and hedging under regime switching models.  To the standard model we add jumps of various types.  In particular, we consider a jump that is synchronous with a change in the regime state.  Thus, for example, we can define a process such that the stock price moves to a high volatility state and simultaneously has a large downward jump in returns.  This type of model is consistent with market experience.  We derive the compensator for our synchronous jumps and price options on such a price process using Fourier transforms.  We also test the model on S&amp;P futures options and show that it performs significantly better than a jump diffusion model.  Furthermore, we look at the problem of hedging options under finitely many regime states and with finitely many possible jump sizes.  We find risk-free hedge portfolios using the risk-free asset, the underlying asset, and finitely many options.  Our risk-free trading strategy is consistent with any equivalent martingale measure, and so does not in itself specify which measure should be used to price options.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hedging.</field><field name="subject">Regime-swiching.</field><field name="subject">Pricing.</field><field name="subject">Derivative.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of Human Papillomavirus promoters to target Cervical Cancer cells</field><field name="creator">Lung, Mandy Siu Yu, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Infections by high-risk HPVs, such as HPV-18, have been associated etiologically with cervical cancer. The successful development of HPV vaccines may be beneficial to the HPV-na??ve population, but women that have already been exposed to the virus are still at risk of developing HPV-associated malignancies. A need for a systemic cure for HPV-infection therefore still exists. Gene therapies using tissue-specific promoters have been reported to be a promising tool for treating cancers; however, few studies have explored this possibility for cervical cancer.	The aim of this project is to construct a gene expression vector that can specifically target HPV-infected cervical cancer cells, by making use of the activity and selectivity of the P105 promoter which is determined by transcription control elements within the HPV-18 long control region (LCR). The first part of this study involved the construction of LCR deletion plasmids, and examining the subsequent level of gene expression induced within different mammalian cell lines. The results suggest the LCR to be capable in achieving cervical cancer-specific gene expression. The 3&#8242;-end of the viral L1 gene upstream of the LCR appeared to have a repressive effect on the promoter and therefore should be excluded for maximum LCR promoter activity. The second part of the project involved site-directed mutagenesis studies performed on selected transcription factor binding sites with an attempt to further increase the level of LCR promoter activity and specificity towards HPV-infected cervical cancer cells. The results suggest that a GRE/YY1 mutation may significantly enhance promoter activity. In terms of promoter regulation, the E2BSs appeared to be responsible for promoter activation in the absence of viral E2 proteins.  	The findings of this study suggest a possible gene therapy approach towards the treatment of cervical cancer. By making use of the activity and specificity of the HPV-18 P105 promoter to induce cervical carcinoma-specific expression of appropriate therapeutic genes, suicidal phenotypes can be introduced selectively within HPV-positive cervical cancer cells while normal HPV-negative cells are unaffected.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Human Papillomavirus</field><field name="subject">HPV-18 LCR</field><field name="subject">Cervical Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pleasure of appearances</field><field name="creator">Zamberlan, Lisa, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Decoration holds a contested position in built environment scholarship.

The first class of model that we use mixes a continuous diffusion process with discrete jumps at random points in time (Poisson Jump Diffusion Model). We also apply a purely discontinuous model that does not contain any continuous component at all in the underlying distribution (Variance Gamma Model). These models have been shown to have some success in capturing certain characteristics of return distributions, a few being leptokurtosis and skewness. Calibrating these models onto the returns of an index of Australian stocks (All Ordinaries Index), we then use the resulting parameters to obtain daily estimates of VaR. In order to obtain the VaR estimates for the Poisson Jump Diffusion Model and the Variance Gamma Model, we introduce the use of an innovation from option pricing techniques, which concentrates on the more tractable characteristic functions of the models. Having then obtained a series of VaR estimates, we then apply a variety of criteria to assess how each model performs and also evaluate these models against the traditional approaches to calculating VaR, such as that suggested by J.P. Morgan???s RiskMetrics. Our results show that whilst the Poisson Jump Diffusion model proved the most accurate at the 95% VaR level, neither the Poisson Jump Diffusion or Variance Gamma models were dominant in the other performance criteria examined. Overall, no model was clearly superior according to all the performance criteria analysed, and it seems that the extra computational time required to calibrate the Poisson Jump Diffusion and Variance Gamma models for the purposes of VaR estimation do not provide sufficient reward for the additional effort than that currently employed by Riskmetrics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Variance Gamma Model.</field><field name="subject">Value at risk.</field><field name="subject">Jump Diffusion Model.</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment.</field><field name="subject">Pricing -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="subject">Poisson distribution.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lexicographic path searches for FPGA routing</field><field name="creator">So, Keith Kam-Ho, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation reports on studies of the application of lexicographic graph searches to solve problems in FPGA detailed routing. Our contributions include the derivation of iteration limits for scalar implementations of negotiation congestion for standard floating point types and the identification of pathological cases for path choice. In the study of the routability-driven detailed FPGA routing problem, we show universal detailed routability is NP-complete based on a related proof by Lee and Wong. We describe the design of a lexicographic composition operator of totally-ordered monoids as path cost metrics and show its optimality under an adapted A* search. Our new router, CornNC, based on lexicographic composition of congestion and wirelength, established a new minimum track count for the FPGA Place and Route Challenge. For the problem of long-path timing-driven FPGA detailed routing, we show that long-path budgeted detailed routability is NP-complete by reduction to universal detailed routability. We generalise the lexicographic composition to any finite length and verify its optimality under A* search. The application of the timing budget solution of Ghiasi et al. is used to solve the long-path timing budget problem for FPGA connections. Our delay-clamped spiral lexicographic composition design, SpiralRoute, ensures connection based budgets are always met, thus achieves timing closure when it successfully routes. For 113 test routing instances derived from standard benchmarks, SpiralRoute found 13 routable instances with timing closure that were unroutable by a scalar negotiated congestion router and achieved timing closure in another 27 cases when the scalar router did not, at the expense of increased runtime.

To investigate these changes, 8 groups of rats in 4 different studies including a control saline group of the same age, gender and strain were evaluated for cardiac morphology and function including: (1) DOX dose response using a cumulative dose of 7.5mg/kg, and 15mg/kg in 8-10 week old female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, (2) strain differences were investigated in response to a cumulative dose of 15mg/kg in 8-10 week old female Fisher (F344) rats compared to the SD rats treated with same dose, (3) the role of gender and aging were studied in response to DOX at a cumulative dose of 3mg/kg in male and female neonates,  and (4) combined losartan and a cumulative dose of 15mg/kg of DOX in 8-10 week old female SD rats compared to controls of saline and 15mg/kg treated SD rats.  Method: Onset of cardiac toxicity was assessed by echocardiography and the rat model of heart failure was developed when the fractional shortening declined &#8804; 40%. The mean arterial pressure and single-photon-emission computer tomography scanning and Tc-99m-HYNIC-Annexin V were performed at week 10 to analyze blood pressure and quantify apoptosis, respectively. All rats were euthanized at week 10 except for the neonates and two of the 7.5mg/kg-treated SD rats that were left alive for study of long -term cardiac side effects. The heart and kidney tissues were harvested for protein isolation and histopathological studies. Blood samples were collected for hematological and lipid profile analysis in all the rats. Results: A dose- and time-dependent increase in LVmass coincided with a parallel increase in MAP, kidney damage, expression of myocardial erbB2, heat shock protein 90 Akt, mTOR, GSK-3&#946;, TGF-&#946;, pSMAD2, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in SD rats treated with 7.5mg/kg and 15mg/kg of DOX at week 10. The 7.5 kg/kg treatment showed adaptive hypertrophy whereas the 15mg/kg treatment group showed maladaptive hypertrophy. However decompensation was apparent by week 14 in other rats treated with 7.5mg/kg. LVmass, FS, MAP, kidney damage, red blood cells and blood lipid levels were not significantly altered in the F344 rats compared to the 15 mg/kg-treated SD rats. Losartan supplementation reduced the left ventricular hypertrophy, improved myocardial contractility, and reduced TGF-&#946; expression compared to the DOX-treated SD rats. The 3mg/kg of DOX in neonates induced cardiac toxicity and deaths in about 60% of males 50 weeks after treatment; the females instead developed mammary tumors. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that age, gender, and strain differences are risks factors for doxorubicin-induced harmful reno-cardiovascular toxicity. The inhibition of TGF-&#946; expression by losartan can be used in prevention of chronic doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity without interfering with its anti-tumor activities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tc-99m-HYNIC-Annexin V</field><field name="subject">Doxorubicin</field><field name="subject">Echocardiography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of energy flow through coupled plate structures</field><field name="creator">Skeen, Michael Berling, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis presents research aims to improving the dynamic modelling of coupled plate structures across a wide frequency range by using analytical, statistical and experimental methods. The analytical waveguide method is used to model the flexural displacement of coupled plate structures which are simply supported along two parallel edges. A method of quickly predicting the average energy level in a plate from details of the waveguide model is described, and used for comparison with SEA models. The Poynting and Impedance methods of predicting the energy flow in coupled plate structures are investigated. Transmission coefficients for coupled plate structures are evaluated using the analytical waveguide method for both semi-infinite and finite coupled plate structures. Finite transmission coefficients have traditionally been more difficult to evaluate due to the presence of a reverberant field, but in this work a novel method of separating the reverberant field using a scattering matrix method is presented. The transmission coefficients for semi-infinite and finite structures are then compared for L-shaped plates. A modal transmission coefficient is also defined and for the cases considered, and is used to develop an alternative method of deriving the transmission coefficient in a finite structure. Frequency averaged transmission coefficients are also considered, and the transmission coefficients derived for finite and semi-infinite structures are found to be very similar after frequency averaging.  Statistical Energy Analysis models of coupled plates are evaluated using transmission coefficients derived from waveguide models. The results of the SEA models are compared to those predicted by the analytical waveguide method. A modal transmission coefficient based SEA model is also investigated. In an attempt to validate the numerical work presented in this thesis, experiments have been conducted. Using a wave extraction technique, both the wave amplitudes and plate properties have been evaluated from experimental data, and are subsequently used to experimentally measure the transmission coefficient for two plates coupled at different angles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plates (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Transmission</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living in public space: a human rights wasteland?</field><field name="creator">Goldie, Cassandra Mary-Ellen, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the extent to which human rights law may be used to challenge the forced eviction of people who live in public space under public space laws.  The specific case study is the operation of Darwin City Council By-law 103, which bans camping, or adults sleeping in a public place between sunset and sunrise.  The by-law is used to criminalise or forcibly evict people who live in public space in Darwin in the Northern Territory.  Darwin has the highest proportionate number of homeless people of any capital city in Australia.  Indigenous people are significantly over-represented.  The thesis charts recent legislative changes across Australia to demonstrate that public space laws, such as Darwin City Council By-law 103, continue to be popular public policy responses to law and order concerns.  This legal regulation is being undertaken without ensuring compliance with international human rights standards.  There has been a marked increase in Australia of the use of available domestic and international human rights tools to raise concerns about the enforcement of these laws against people living in public space.  Through a review of secondary sources, the thesis establishes that some 15 human rights have been identified as potentially engaged by such enforcement but Australian jurisprudence has yet to emerge.  The thesis selects the human right to privacy, family and home for detailed analysis.  It interrogates available evidence from Darwin, international and comparative jurisprudence and secondary sources to determine whether the forced eviction of people living in public space under Darwin City Council By-law 103 may be found to violate the right to respect for privacy, family and home in a particular case.  The study aims to make a specific contribution to growing endeavours to promote the human rights of people who are homeless, including people who live in public space. Its detailed analysis is designed to support a human rights litigation strategy at both domestic and international level, in order to challenge the extent to which people living in public space are subjected to criminalisation and forced eviction when they have nowhere else to live.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public space</field><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="subject">homelessness</field><field name="subject">long grasser</field><field name="subject">right to privacy, family and home</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">Darwin</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal memory models for verifying C systems code</field><field name="creator">Tuch, Harvey, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Systems code is almost universally written in the C programming language or a variant. C has a very low level of type and memory abstraction and formal reasoning about C systems code requires a memory model that is able to capture the semantics of C pointers and types. At the same time, proof-based verification demands abstraction, in particular from the aliasing and frame problems.  In this thesis, we study the mechanisation of a series of models, from semantic to separation logic, for achieving this abstraction when performing interactive theorem-prover based verification of C systems code in higher- order logic. We do not commit common oversimplifications, but correctly deal with C's model of programming language values and the heap, while developing the ability to reason abstractly and efficiently. We validate our work by demonstrating that the models are applicable to real, security- and safety-critical code by formally verifying the memory allocator of the L4 microkernel. All formalisations and proofs have been developed and machine-checked in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Separation logic</field><field name="subject">Formal verification</field><field name="subject">C (Computer program language)</field><field name="subject">Theorem proving</field><field name="subject">Operating systems</field><field name="subject">C++ (Computer program language)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the characterisation, procoagulant activity and Annexin V binding properties of platelet-derived microparticles.</field><field name="creator">Connor, David Ewan, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Platelet-derived microparticles, released as a result of platelet activation, promote coagulation through the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, acting as the catalytic site for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by the activated coagulation factors X and V. Although elevated numbers of circulating platelet-derived microparticles can be detected in a number of clinical disorders, the methods for the detection of these microparticles are far from standardised. In addition, recent reports have also speculated that not all microparticles may expose phosphatidylserine, demonstrating that the binding of Annexin V, a phosphatidylserine-specific binding protein, is not detectable on a population of microparticles. The initial stage of this thesis was to establish a flow cytometric method for the detection and enumeration of microparticles based on their capacity to bind Annexin V and to utilise this assay to investigate a number of the issues that have limited assay standardisation. The assay could be performed on either stimulated or unstimulated plasma or whole blood samples. Interestingly, plasma microparticle counts were significantly higher than whole blood microparticle counts. The effects of centrifugation alone could not be attributed as the sole source of this discrepancy. The antigenic characteristics of platelet-derived microparticles were also investigated, with platelet-derived microparticles demonstrated to express the platelet glycoproteins CD31, CD41a, CD42a and CD61. Platelet-derived microparticles also expressed CD42b, and this expression was significantly decreased when compared to their progenitor platelets. The expression of the platelet activation markers CD62p, CD63, CD40L and PAC-1 was dependent upon the sample milieu, suggesting that the centrifugation conditions required to generate platelet-poor plasma may lead to artefactual increases in the expression of platelet activation markers. An investigation of the role of the GpIIb/IIIa complex on the formation of platelet-derived microparticles was also performed. A monoclonal antibody to the GpIIb/IIIa complex (Abciximab) significantly inhibited in vitro collagen-stimulated platelet-derived microparticle formation. Interestingly, platelets obtained from two subjects with impaired GpIIb/IIIa activation, demonstrated normal microparticle formation following collagen stimulation, suggesting that the presence of GpIIb/IIIa complex, but not its activation, is required for collagen-induced microparticle formation. A novel mechanism for microparticle formation was also investigated, with platelet-derived microparticles demonstrated to form in response to the sclerosing agents sodium-tetradecyl sulphate and polidocanol. Interestingly, the removal of plasma proteins by the washing of platelets left platelets more susceptible to sclerosant-induced microparticle formation, suggesting that plasma proteins may protect platelets from microparticle formation. The procoagulant activity of platelet-derived microparticles was also investigated using a novel coagulation assay (XACT) specific for the procoagulant phospholipid. An evaluation of this assay demonstrated a significant correlation between Annexin V binding microparticle counts and procoagulant activity in both whole blood and plasma samples. There was more procoagulant activity in whole blood samples than in plasma samples, suggesting that the procoagulant phospholipid activity was also associated with erythrocytes or leukocytes. To further investigate this phenomenon, a whole blood flow cytometric assay was developed to assess Annexin V binding to erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets and microparticles. This assay demonstrated that a large proportion of Annexin V binding (51.0%) was associated with erythrocytes. Interestingly, a proportion of the Annexin V binding erythrocytes (24.5%) and leukocytes (78.8%) were also associated with platelet CD61 antigen, suggesting that they also bound a platelet or platelet-derived microparticle. The effect of sample anticoagulant on microparticle procoagulant activity was investigated. Microparticle counts were most stable in EDTA anticoagulated samples, but were stable in sodium citrate for up to 15 minutes following sample collection. The procoagulant activity of microparticles was significantly inhibited by EDTA in collagen-stimulated platelet-rich plasma samples, when compared to sodium citrate anticoagulated samples. Although the initial method used to investigate microparticles was based upon their ability to bind Annexin V, it was consistently observed that a large proportion of events in the size region of a microparticle were Annexin V negative. An investigation was therefore commenced into the procoagulant activity of microparticles based on their capacity to bind Annexin V. The presence of Annexin V negative microparticles was confirmed by flow cytometry and the proportion of microparticles that bound Annexin V was dependent upon type of agonist used to stimulate microparticle formation. Varying the assay constituents (calcium concentration / Annexin V concentration / buffer type) did not alter the proportion of Annexin V binding microparticles. When compared to Annexin V positive microparticles, Annexin V negative microparticles expressed significantly higher levels of CD42b on their surface, but possessed significantly decreased expressions of CD62p, and CD63. A significant correlation between the percentage of Annexin V binding and XACT procoagulant activity was found (p=0.03). Furthermore, Annexin V binding inhibited greater than 98% of procoagulant phospholipid activity, suggesting that Annexin V binding was a true reflection of procoagulant activity. Microparticles could be sorted using either a flow cytometric or magnetic sorting strategy. By electron microscopy, Annexin V negative events isolated following magnetic sorting were vesicular structures and not small platelets or the remnants of activated platelets. In summary, this thesis has demonstrated the ability of the flow cytometer and XACT assays to detect microparticles and their procoagulant activity. It has also shown that the use of Annexin V to detect microparticles may warrant further investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphatidylserine.</field><field name="subject">Platelet.</field><field name="subject">Microparticle.</field><field name="subject">Procoagulant phospholipid.</field><field name="subject">XACT.</field><field name="subject">Platelet-derived growth factor.</field><field name="subject">Plasma.</field><field name="subject">Platelet activating factor.</field><field name="subject">Lipocortins.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of appropriate instructional design to match the ability of the learner</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Elizabeth Anne, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Content analyses of research in the literature of gifted education (Coleman, 2006; Rogers, 1999, 2006) has shown a consistent absence of research investigating methodology for instructing gifted students and for the development of expertise using new technologies. In this study, utilising electronic instructional delivery, an investigation was undertaken of the differential effects and appropriateness of matching the prior knowledge of the learner to the instructional method. Underpinned with a theoretical understanding of gifted education and cognitive load theory, a series of three experiments was designed and implemented to determine whether gifted students learn more effectively under guided discovery design than with example based instruction, while not identified as gifted ability students perform significantly better under direct example based instruction than with guided discovery. Data were collected and analysed in three stages. Experiment 1 was conducted in the novel domain of Boolean switching equations. Experiments 2 and 3 used identical test instruments with novel tasks in the semi-familiar domain of geometry. A total of 155 Years 7, 8 and 9 students at three metropolitan secondary schools participated. The study explored whether the presence of schemas, that facilitated greater problem-solving ability in gifted students, would generate clear evidence of instructional efficiency and preference for either mode of instruction. As students advanced from novice state to expert in particular domains of learning, it was anticipated that gifted students would progress from benefiting from worked example instruction to more efficient learning in guided discovery mode. This hypothesis was rejected as the results from each of the experiments did not confirm the hypothesised outcomes. There was no manifested expertise-reversal effect. The absence of any clear delineation of enhanced learning proficiency mode of instruction for gifted students does, however, contribute to the advancement and understanding of cognitive load theory and the complexity of learning strategies necessary for gifted learners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted children education</field><field name="subject">gifted and talented children</field><field name="subject">cognitive load theory</field><field name="subject">technology study and teaching</field><field name="subject">guided discovery instruction</field><field name="subject">worked examples instruction</field><field name="subject">Ability grouping in education</field><field name="subject">Gifted children -- Education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The generation of monoclonal antibodies to  investigate perlecan turnover in cells and  tissues</field><field name="creator">Ma, Jin, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Perlecan is an important basement membrane heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan that is essential for various cell signaling events involved in tissue development. Heparanase is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the turnover of HS. This project aimed to assist in researching the structure of HS on perlecan and how this structure changes with tissue development. This will be achieved by generating monoclonal antibodies that have an altered affinity for perlecan after heparanase treatment.  Recombinant perlecan domain I was characterized by ELISA and western blotting and used as the antigen for two fusions. The first fusion was focused on the production of IgM the common subtype of anti-glycosaminoglycans antibodies. However, no clones were produced, which may have been due to the lack of feeder layers. In order to address this problem, the fibroblast cell line MRC-5 was used as a feeder layer in the second fusion. From this fusion, we obtained 216 positive cultures, which were screened against full length perlecan from endothelial cells. Of these, 26 cultures were tested against heparanase treated perlecan, and then 2 cultures were chosen for subcloning based on the different immunoreactivity between enzyme treated and nontreated perlecan. From the 2 chosen cultures, 13 sub clones were derived and 10 of them were adapted into a serum free culture environment. The 10 monoclonal antibodies displayed strong immunoreactivity with full length perlecan in ELISA and Western Blotting. When they were used as primary antibodies in Immunocytochemistry, they were able to recognize the native perlecan deposited by human chondrocytes. When the cells were incubated with heparanase, antibody 5D7-2E4 and 13E9-3G5 showed an increase in immunoreactivity while antibody 13E9-3B3 gave a decrease. These three antibodies will be the potential tools used in the future to study perlecan turnover in different cells and tissue. The remaining seven antibodies will also be very useful in the research of perlecan as they have been shown to bind to the protein core. In the future, it will be worth subcloning some of the frozen stored stocks of uncloned hybridomas, where there are potential opportunities to select antibodies, which will react with the carbohydrate chains on perlecan.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heparanase.</field><field name="subject">Perlecan.</field><field name="subject">Heparan sulfate proteoglycan</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal antibody.</field><field name="subject">Basement membrane.</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal antibodies.</field><field name="subject">Hybridomas.</field><field name="subject">Cells.</field><field name="subject">Tissues.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular regulation and enhancement of megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis by the p45 subunit of NF-E2.</field><field name="creator">Fock, Ee-Ling, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Megakaryocytes (MKs) are a rare population of haematopoietic cells, which produce platelets. Platelet production is a complex process that is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level by lineage specific transcription factors such as p45 NF-E2. Understanding how transcriptional regulators operate is imperative to advance our knowledge of disease pathophysiology and to propose novel treatment options. Therefore, the aims of this study were to: i) study the effects of p45 NF-E2 overexpression on various stages of megakaryopoiesis; (ii) elucidate the nuclear transport mechanisms of p45 NF-E2; and iii) determine the impact of a p45 NF-E2 modification called SUMOylation on thrombopoiesis.  Exogenous p45 NF-E2 was overexpressed in haematopoietic cells in culture and various aspects of megakaryopoiesis were examined. Overexpression of p45 NF-E2 enhanced multiple stages of MK differentiation such as colony forming unit (CFU)-MK formation and terminal MK maturation. Most importantly, p45 NF-E2 overexpression resulted in significant increases in proplatelet and functional platelet production in vitro. This latter result was confirmed in vivo using lethally irradiated mice transplanted with cells that overexpressed p45 NF-E2. Unexpectedly, the enhancement of MK differentiation was at the expense of myeloid development and, for the first time, identified p45 NF-E2 as a negative regulator of myeloid differentiation.  Secondly, we determined the nuclear localisation signal of p45-NF-E2 and the pathway responsible for nuclear import. We also investigated the importance of p45 NF-E2 nuclear import in thrombopoiesis. Finally, we showed that p45 NF-E2 is modified mainly by SUMO-2/3 in bone marrow cells and this process is involved in the transcriptional activation of MK-specific genes and platelet release.  Taken together, these results suggest that enforced expression of p45 NF-E2 selectively enhances many aspects of MK differentiation including early and terminal MK maturation, proplatelet formation and platelet release. Equally important, this thesis also indicates that white blood cell differentiation may be inhibited by p45 overexpression, while molecular processes such as the nuclear import and SUMOylation of p45 NF-E2 are vital for thrombopoiesis. These observations will facilitate subsequent studies into the feasibility of manipulating p45 NF-E2 protein levels for the treatment of conditions such as thrombocytopaenia and other platelet disorders.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thrombopoiesis</field><field name="subject">Megakaryocytes</field><field name="subject">NF-E2</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of non-linear features in the business cycle</field><field name="creator">Engel, James, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Writers on the business cycle often emphasize that non-linear models are needed to account for certain of its features. Thus it is often said that either the asymmetry of the duration of business cycle expansions and contractions or the variability of these quantities demand a non-linear model. Such comments are rarely made precise however and mostly consist of references to such assertions from the past. Thus the asymmetry in the cycle is mostly accompanied by references to Keynes (1936) and Burns and Mitchell (1946). But these authors were looking at what we call today the classical cycle i.e. movements in the level of GDP, and so the fact that there are long expansions and short contractions can arise simply due to the presence of long-run growth in the economy, and it is not obvious that it has much to do with non-linearity. This thesis aims to introduce various statistics that can be used to characterise the specific shape of the non-linearity observed in macroeconomic time series. Chapter 2 introduces a range of statistics and presents the dating algorithm used in this thesis, which is based on the BBQ algorithm of Harding and Pagan (2002). Chapter 3 tests the adequacy of linear models versus the SETAR model of van Dijk and Franses(2003) and the bounceback model of Kim, Morley and Piger (2005) in capturing observed non-linear features of the data. Chapter 4 extends this work by examining the three state Markov model of Hamilton (1989), again using the ??bounce-back?? model of Kim C., Morley, J. and J. Piger, (2005), and the more complicated ??tension?? model of DeJong, D., Dharmarajan, H., Liesenfeld, R. and Richard, J., (2005). Chapter 4 also extends Chapter 3 by estimating the above mentioned models on US GDP, Australian non-farm GDP, US investment and Australian dwellings investment. They are then simulated in order to gauge the cycle properties. Chapter 5 analyses the business cycle implications of two related multivariate dynamic factor models presented in papers by Kim and Piger (2001, 2002).

Equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) is a useful process for producing these types of structures whereby the material is deformed to very high plastic strains by passing a billet several times through the ECAP die. This process has an added advantage maintaining the initial dimensions of the billet. SMG materials produced by ECAP and related routes are useful as they usually exhibit excellent properties including high strength and hardness, and excellent superplastic formability: these and other properties make SMG materials useful for industrial and aerospace applications. In this thesis, a binary aluminium alloy containing a very low concentration of scandium (0.1 wt. %) Sc alloy was investigated and compared with higher Sc-containing alloys. The material was deformed by ECAP in the solution treated condition to an equivalent von Mises strain of 9.2 then pre-aged at 250 0C to generate a submicron grained material containing a relatively uniform dispersion of nanosized Al3Sc dispersiods. The thermal stability of this pre-aged microstructure was investigated by annealing at temperatures up to 450 0C resulted in continuous grain coarsening by the process of continuous recrystallization whereby the initial microstructure evolves gradually with no marked change in the grain size distribution, texture and grain boundary character. However, extended annealing (&gt; 1h) at 4500 C resulted in discontinuous grain coarsening (often termed recrystallization) whereby a few grains grow rapidly to eventually produce a coarse-grained final microstructure. Throughout annealing, there was a good correlation between the dispersion parameter, (f/d) where f and d is the volume fraction and the mean diameter of Al3Sc particles in the alloy, respectively, and both the mean grain size (D ) and D /D max where max D is the maximum grain diameter observed in the microstructure. The grain structure was found to undergo moderate coarsening at the high f/d-values but converted to a coarsegrained structure for f/d ~&lt;0.5/&#956;m, and this change occurred when the mean grain diameter was ~ 3-4&#956;m. Hence, the critical value of the dispersion parameter for the transition from continuous to discontinuous coarsening falls between the theoretical value for submicron grain size alloys (f/d ~ 1.5/&#956;m) and the value found for conventionally-deformed alloys (f/d ~ 0.1/&#956;m). This behaviour is the result of the alloy no longer being ultra-fine grained at the onset of discontinuous coarsening.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recrystallization</field><field name="subject">Super Plastic Deformation</field><field name="subject">Submicron grain</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk, efficiency and industry dynamics in the Australian banking sector</field><field name="creator">Pelosi, Tano, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis applies innovative methods to the efficiency and productivity analysis of the Australian banking system. Key areas of investigation include the impact of regulatory reforms on bank performance, the impact of firm entry and exit on industry productivity and the changing nature of banking and the role of risk in measuring bank value-added. The latter leads to the construction of a new bank production model, emphasising risk management as part of a bank??s value-added. As such, the proposed bank output framework views risk as a productive service, rather than a bad output or externality, which is often assumed in the literature. Aided with this new framework, several refinements are suggested for the treatment and measurement of bank output by researchers and statistical agencies. A unified regulatory framework combined with a greater level of harmonisation in rules in the Australian banking sector, has meant that a pooled analysis of all deposit-taking institutions has become feasible for the first time. With an enlarged dataset new insights are gained into the relative performance of deposit-taking institutions in Australia. The results challenge commonly held views of bank efficiency and the relevance of scale, size and incumbency when measuring bank efficiency. The new definition of bank output is also applied across the sector using econometric and non-parametric techniques to gauge productivity. Problems with balanced data sets and aggregation of firm level productivity are examined. A new approach to decomposing aggregate industry level productivity is introduced based on strong axiomatic grounds and its ability to attribute productivity between continuing, exiting and entering firms. The technique is applied for the first time and uses the newly developed bank output production model. The analysis provides key information on the relative performance of firms in the Australian banking sector.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Banking</field><field name="subject">Efficiency</field><field name="subject">Risk</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Undoing theatre: forced entertainment and 'the formless'</field><field name="creator">Williams, David Anthony, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the theatre of Sheffield-based theatre group Forced Entertainment in terms of what art historian Robert Hewison terms 'Social Surrealism'.

While Hewison links these practices to the so-called 'classical' Surrealism theorised by Andr?? Breton, I will argue that a more appropriate and useful Surrealist lineage to account for Forced Entertainment's theatre can be found in the writings of Andr?? Breton's main Surrealist rival, Georges Bataille. This thesis focuses on Bataille's notion of 'the formless' or formlessness, that which undoes and unravels the security and fixity of form, and uses this as a theoretical concept to account for the aesthetics and unravelling theatre practice of Forced Entertainment. This thesis then examines a selection of theatre works by Forced Entertainment, tracing the ways in which these works undo theatre using formlessness.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theater.</field><field name="subject">Forced Entertainment (Theater group)</field><field name="subject">Georges Bataille.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of fuzzy logic, GIS and remote sensing to the assessment of environmental factors for extensive brackishwater aquaculture in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">-, Tarunamulia, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Extensive brackishwater aquaculture, which is a dominant land-based aquaculture system in Indonesia, has experienced variable success in most farming locations in the country due to poor understanding of spatial assessment of environmental factors and rudimentary site selection criteria. Despite tremendous potential, the application of GIS and remote sensing in spatial assessment has tended to focus on Boolean (Crisp) logic that is often unable to effectively handle the complexity and spatial variability of key environmental factors for the development of aquaculture.  This study explored the possibility of integrating fuzzy logic techniques into GIS and remote sensing technology to generate more robust mapping protocols in aquaculture, compensating for the disadvantages of the Crisp method.  Two models were developed in two different provinces in Indonesia to spatially assess soil and hydrological constraints on extensive brackishwater aquaculture. The soil assessment focussed on acid sulfate soils (ASS) and sandy-textured sediments in Aceh, and the hydrological study focused on investigating important wave parameters that influence the suitability of coastal areas for siting extensive pond units in South Sulawesi.  The study showed that fuzzy-based classification methods, integrated into the image analysis, was highly effective in identifying existing and potential pond areas for extensive brackishwater aquaculture compared to the best result of the commonly used Crisp method. By addition of one or more key environmental variables of ASS into the fuzzy-classified existing and potential ponds areas, a very robust predictive tool to identify potential ponds areas affected by ASS in Kembang Tanjung, Aceh was developed.  A more detailed assessment of ASS developed in this study also successfully highlighted the severity of sandy-soils and identified them as another key soil variable that has and will severely impact on pond productivity.  The second model developed by the study enables fuzzy logic to be integrated into GIS to predict the possible areas impacted by moderate to high energy wave conditions and possible ways of minimising their direct and indirect impacts. The models developed in this study were shown to work well in both study sites and can be applied elsewhere. The mapping outputs are easy to interpret even by stakeholders with no prior training in map reading. Overall, the models have the potential to reduce planning errors and to improve decision making in aquaculture provided that quality data sources are used.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquaculture -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">GIS and Remote Sensing</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy logic -- Industrial applications -- Congresses</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Escherichia coli GTPase Der reveals previously unknown regulation by RNA</field><field name="creator">Aung-Htut, May Thandar, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">GTPases are found in all domains of life and are highly conserved. In eukaryotes, they serve as signalling molecules for many cellular processes. However, the prokaryotic GTPases play a very different role and are found to be associated with ribosome function. Among the 11 conserved GTPases, Der is the most interesting in prokaryotes. It possesses a unique structure with two GTPase domains (G-Domains) tethered by a variable length acidic linker and a carboxyl terminal KH-like domain. The exact function of Der is still under investigation and most of the data suggest that it is important for 50S ribosomal assembly or stability. In order to investigate the function of Escherichia coli Der (Ec-Der), expression plasmids for wild-type and mutated proteins were created and the proteins were successfully expressed. The expression of the mutant protein that lacked G-Domain 1 was toxic to the cells and it was found that some large ribosomal proteins were missing from the ribosomes of these cells. In addition, other macromolecular complexes such as the GroEL/GroES chaperonin appeared not to be assembled under these conditions. The activities of both wild-type and mutated proteins were also tested and found to be dependent on potassium ions (K+), which enhanced nucleotide binding. Additionally, intra-molecular control over nucleotide binding and release was also observed for Ec-Der. The in vitro selection of RNA aptamers with nanomolar affinity for Ec-Der produced aptamers that contained short variable sequences. These aptamers affected the growth of the E. coli cells and caused a change in cellular morphology that had been noted previously during Ec-Der over-expression. Ec-Der showed high affinity (nM) to both selected RNA and the unselected RNA library. The activity of Ec-Der and Era was inhibited in the presence of any sequence of RNA that has the length of greater than 16 nucleotides. RNA was also cross-linked to Ec-Der in the presence of GTP, but not GDP, suggesting that RNA was a regulator of the Ec-Der GTPase cycle. Based on these results, it is speculated that Ec-Der might be involved in more than one function. It may be acting at the level of the membrane (based on cellular morphology reported here and by Hwang and Inouye 2001) and may also take part in processes related to ribosome function. Regulation of protein activity by RNA length has not been predicted or described and this may represent a novel mean of regulation of the Era subfamily of GTPases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">control by RNA</field><field name="subject">GTPase</field><field name="subject">Nucleotides binding/release</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of putative functional motifs in viral proteins essential for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA replication</field><field name="creator">Woon, Heng Giap, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous virus that causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Although there are prophylactic treatments available, all current antiviral drugs ultimately target the DNA polymerase, resulting in the increasing emergence of antiviral resistant strains in the clinical setting. There is a fundamental need for understanding the role of other essential genes in DNA replication as a foundation for developing new antiviral treatments that are safe and which utilize a mechanism of action different to existing therapies. In this study we looked at six HCMV replication genes encoding for the DNA polymerase accessory protein (UL44), single stranded DNA binding protein (UL57), primase (UL70), helicase (UL105), primase-helicase associated protein (UL102), and the putative initiator protein (UL84) in order to increase our understanding of their role in DNA replication. The aim of this project was to identify variation within these genes as well as to predict putative domains and motifs in order to ultimately express and study the functional properties of the HCMV primase (UL70) through the use of recombinant mutants. Sequencing of these genes revealed a high degree of conservation between the isolates with amino acid sequence identity of &gt;97% for all genes. Using ScanProsite software from the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) proteomics server, we have mapped putative motifs throughout these HCMV replication genes. In particular, highly conserved putative Nlinked glycosylation sites were identified in UL105 that were also conserved across 33 homologues as well as several unique motifs including casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (CKII) in UL105 and UL84, a microbodies signal motif in UL57 and an integrin binding site in the UL102 helicase-primase associated protein. Our investigations have also elucidated motif-rich regions of the UL44 DNA polymerase accessory protein, mapped functionally important domains of the UL105 helicase and identified cysteine motifs that have implications for folding of the UL70 primase. Taken together, these findings provide insights to regions of these HCMV replication proteins that are important for post-translation modification, activation and overall function, and this information can be utilized to target further research into these proteins and advance the development of novel antiviral agents that target these processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytomegalovirus</field><field name="subject">DNA Replicaiton</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prosocial reasoning and empathy in gifted children</field><field name="creator">Hay, Peta Kerin, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study aimed to enhance understanding of the moral reasoning of gifted children.  While research has explored the justice moral reasoning of gifted children (Arbuthnot, 1973; Chovan &amp; Freeman, 1993; Gross, 1993; Henderson, Gold, &amp; Clarke, 1984; Howard-Hamilton, 1994), this study explored prosocial moral reasoning, moral reasoning which involves conflict between one??s own needs and desires and the needs and desires of others.  In addition, this study sought to gather empirical evidence for literature claims that gifted children have higher levels of empathy than their age peers (Lovecky, 1997; Piechowski, 2003; Silverman, 1993b).  The study aimed to investigate the possible relationships among giftedness, prosocial reasoning and empathy.  Primary (elementary) school students aged between 9 and 12 years in the Sydney Metropolitan area were administered The Prosocial Reasoning Objective Measure (PROM), The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and The Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents (IOE) questionnaires.  The results for gifted students (n = 176) were compared with a control group of students not identified as gifted (n = 128).  The study found that gifted students used more of the highest level of prosocial reasoning in the PROM than their age peers.  Furthermore, gifted students used more empathic concern, fantasy empathy and cognitive empathy than their age peers, although ability was not predictive of the other empathy factors in the instruments.  Small but significant correlations between some types of empathy and some levels of prosocial reasoning were also found, indicating possible relationships between empathy and prosocial reasoning.  Interviews were conducted with selected students (n = 13) from the above sample, along with some of their teachers (n = 5) and parents (n = 2).  Despite the small sample, the interviews seemed to indicate a relationship between experience with bullying and prosocial reasoning.  The study highlights the need for an empathy questionnaire that specifically tests cognitive and affective empathy in children.  A new questionnaire may unravel some of the seemingly contradictory results in the present study.  The study also provides empirical evidence that gifted children use higher levels of prosocial moral reasoning and empathy than their age-peers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moral Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Gifted</field><field name="subject">Empathy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assortment factors and category performance: an empirical investigation of Australian organic retailing</field><field name="creator">Tan, Lay Peng, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The broad objective of this study is to examine how assortment factors and category performance are related within the context of specialty retailing. This study formulates two clusters of research questions. The first cluster of research questions focuses on product assortment in general, for example assortment variety and composition. The second cluster of research questions concentrates on a specific area of product assortment, that is, private label products. An organic retailer in Australia collaborates by providing its assortment records and sales reports. The Australian organic retailing industry is an ideal candidate for this study for 1) it is specialty retailing, and 2) the supply situation allows organic retailers considerable flexibility to experiment with different assortment compositions.  This study analyses store level cross sub category data and, to supplement this, it conducts a qualitative study and collects field data. Included in the cross sub category analyses are approximately 140 to 180 organic sub categories. The results show that assortment variety has a positive influence on sub category sales.  The strength of this positive relationship varies across different sub category types, for example food or non-food. For the private label analyses, the results show that, within the focal store, private label SKUs are more likely to be present in sub categories with larger sales and with supermarket competition present. This study also finds that a deeper manufacturer brand assortment hurts private label performance.  This study contributes to a body of cross category empirical generalisations about the complex decisions retailers face by examining the effects of assortment decisions within the context of specialty retailing. It provides some clear empirical evidence for how assortment factors and sub category performance are related through an empirical investigation in a bricks and mortar retail environment. In addition, it tests the generalisability of extant private label research beyond the much discussed conventional supermarket industry and convenience consumer goods contexts.

Undertaking of a literature survey of corrosion issues involving riveting and welding of aluminium and galvanising of steel ??	Undertaking of stress calculations for all components to ensure compliance with the requirements of design principles ??	Confirmation of the stress calculations through finite element modelling ??

Implementation of these design solutions using novel aerospace materials and methods ??	Prediction of future performance through factorial and matrix method approaches  Outcomes: ??	It is hoped that the text provides a documentary basis for future guidance of designers and engineers working in areas related to the subject of the present work. ??	It also is hoped that the work on aerospace technologies will broaden the scope of designers and engineers in the potential that these materials and processes have in building considerations. ??	The manual stress calculations and finite element modelling confirm that the implemented designs are consistently within design specification and that, from the mechanical perspective, no problems are anticipated. ??	Further, since considerable care was taken to ensure that galvanic and other forms of corrosion were avoided through the appropriate use of design, materials, and implementation approaches, no further corrosion has been observed at the site. ??	The development of a generic factorial approach and a specific matrix method, applied to corrosion and welding considerations, was informative but these still are at speculative stages owing to the difficulty of obtaining relevant meaningful data and the problem of assigning weighting factors on what is viewed as a fairly subjective basis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prosthetic vision : Visual modelling, information theory and neural correlates</field><field name="creator">Hallum, Luke Edward, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Electrical stimulation of the retina affected by photoreceptor loss (e.g., cases of retinitis pigmentosa) elicits the perception of luminous spots (so-called phosphenes) in the visual field. This phenomenon, attributed to the relatively high survival rates of neurons comprising the retina's inner layer, serves as the cornerstone of efforts to provide a microelectronic retinal prosthesis -- a device analogous to the cochlear implant. This thesis concerns phosphenes -- their elicitation and modulation, and, in turn, image analysis for use in a prosthesis.  This thesis begins with a comparative review of visual modelling of electrical epiretinal stimulation and analogous acoustic modelling of electrical cochlear stimulation. The latter models involve coloured noise played to normal listeners so as to investigate speech processing and electrode design for use in cochlear implants. Subsequently, four experiments (three psychophysical and one numerical), and two statistical analyses, are presented. Intrinsic signal optical imaging in cerebral cortex is canvassed appendically.  The first experiment describes a visual tracking task administered to 20 normal observers afforded simulated prosthetic vision. Fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuit, and the effect of practice, were assessed. Further, an image analysis scheme is demonstrated that, compared to existing approaches, assisted fixation and pursuit (but not saccade) accuracy (35.8% and 6.8%, respectively), and required less phosphene array scanning. Subsequently, (numerical) information-theoretic reasoning is provided for the scheme's superiority. This reasoning was then employed to further optimise the scheme (resulting in a filter comprising overlapping Gaussian kernels), and may be readily extended to arbitrary arrangements of many phosphenes.  A face recognition study, wherein stimuli comprised either size- or intensity-modulated phosphenes, is then presented. The study involved unpracticed observers (n=85), and showed no 'size' --versus--'intensity' effect. Overall, a 400-phosphene (100-phosphene) image afforded subjects 89.0% (64.0%) correct recognition (two-interval forced-choice paradigm) when five seconds' scanning was allowed. Performance fell (64.5%) when the 400-phosphene image was stabilised on the retina and presented briefly. Scanning was similar in 400- and 100-phosphene tasks.  The final chapter presents the statistical effects of sampling and rendering jitter on the phosphene image. These results may generalise to low-resolution imaging systems involving loosely packed pixels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low vision</field><field name="subject">vision prosthesis</field><field name="subject">cochlear implant</field><field name="subject">information theory</field><field name="subject">phosphenes</field><field name="subject">Vision -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">acoustic modelling</field><field name="subject">optical imaging</field><field name="subject">visual tracking</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">jitter</field><field name="subject">visual modelling</field><field name="subject">face recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Run-time energy-driven optimisation of embedded systems: a complete solution</field><field name="creator">Peddersen, Jorgen, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Consumption of power and conservation of energy have become two of the biggest design challenges in construction of embedded systems.  Energy is a resource in limited supply, but demands are increasing. Hence, much research is being performed to reduce power and energy usage or optimise performance under energy constraints.  There are very few solutions that try to cater for the applications where the data input is not easily testable before run-time.  These applications require an optimisation procedure that knows the power consumption of the system and is able to dynamically optimise operation to maximise performance while meeting energy constraints.  This thesis provides a complete solution to the problem of run-time energy-driven optimisation of application performance.  The complete system, from a processor that is able to provide feedback of the power consumption in parallel to execution, to applications that exploit the power feedback to provide dynamic optimisation.  A processor that estimates its own power consumption is designed by the addition of small dedicated counters that tally occurrences of power consuming events which are macro modelled. The methodology is demonstrated on a standard processor achieving an average power estimation error of less than 2% while increasing area of the processor by only 5%.  This enables energy-driven optimisation via application adaptation. Modification techniques and low-overhead algorithms are provided to demonstrate how energy feedback can be effectively used to maximise performance of algorithms within given constraints. Applications?? quality is maximised under given energy constraints using less than 0.02% of the execution time. Finally, the dissertation discusses the systems used to demonstrate the methodologies and techniques created throughout the research project. These implementations of the energy-driven optimisation system verify the soundness of the methods and applicability of the approaches used.  This is the first time a complete solution for energy-driven optimisation has been shown, from creation of the processor to analysis of software utilising the approach.  The methodologies and techniques can be applied to a variety of applications in a range of fields such as multimedia and networking that have never been possible before.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">energy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the xanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase of helicobacter pylori as a potential therapeutic target</field><field name="creator">Duckworth, Megan Jane, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Helicobacter pylori infects more than half of the global population and causes gastric disorders. The increasing development of antibiotic resistance by the bacterium continues to limit treatment options. The identification and characterisation of novel therapeutic targets are necessary for successful future treatment of the infection.  One potential target for therapeutic intervention is the gpt gene encoded by hp0735 (jhp0672) in H. pylori strain 26695 (J99). This gene produces a putative xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (XGPRTase), an enzyme of the purine salvage synthesis pathway. This project employed theoretical, molecular and biochemical approaches to investigate features of H. pylori gpt and XGPRTase that will serve to ascertain their therapeutic potential.  The production of a functional XGPRTase by H. pylori was investigated in cell-free extracts, and the kinetic parameters of this activity were compared to those of purified rXGPRTase enzyme. The three 6-oxopurine substrates were recognised by rXGPRTase and allosteric kinetics were observed for some substrates of the enzyme in cell-free extracts and for purified enzyme. These observations indicate complex regulation and an influence of cellular interactions on activity.  Bioinformatics were employed to analyse XGPRTase phylogeny, and threading techniques used to build a structural model of XGPRTase. The enzyme is significantly divergent from the equivalent mammalian enzyme, and modelling identified specific features of the enzyme.  Molecular approaches were utilised to analyse the essential role of gpt in H. pylori survival. These included insertional inactivation of the gpt in wild-type H. pylori strains and in mutants possessing a complementing copy of the gene present at the rdxA locus. No mutants were recovered with inactivated gpt possibly as a result of pleiotropic effects. Plasmid-mediated complementation was attempted employing IPTG-inducible shuttle vectors and did not yield any mutants.  Further characterisation of H. pylori XGPRTase was performed by determining the effects of nucleotide monophosphates and purine analogues on enzyme activity. Inhibition by GMP was observed in all cases, however differences in the inhibition by other nucleotide monophosphates were found between cell-free extracts and the recombinant enzyme. Inhibition of rXGPRTase activity was observed by the purine analogue 6-mercaptopurine ribose, a compound that previously has been shown to inhibit H. pylori growth in culture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori..</field><field name="subject">Xanthines -- therapeutic use.</field><field name="subject">Phosphoribosyltransferase.</field><field name="subject">Xanthines -- therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Phosphoribosyltransferase.</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A landscape of compliance, conflict and invention - an administrative history of the New South Wales Treasury, 1824??1976</field><field name="creator">Carew, Roberta Ann, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ministerial responsibility is a corollary of the democratic process. An administrative component of that democratic expression is the Treasury. Federal, state or national treasuries have always played pivotal roles in the political, economic, social, technical and cultural evolution of the political arenas within which they function. This thesis presents, for the first time, an institutional history of the New South Wales Treasury. It includes an analysis of its British antecedents, its establishment in the penal colony of New South Wales, by way of the Commissariat and Colonial Funds, and its subsequent development into one of the most influential State government departments. What is fundamental to the successful and efficient administration of a Treasury in the twenty-first century was also true five thousand years ago. There is a universality of constant principles applying to the administration of the public purse and those principles have not altered over the millennia: security, accountability, transparency, efficiency and control. A component of a modern Treasury is its advisory capacity in financial matters. This thesis, therefore, examines the application of those constants in the context of New South Wales over the previous one hundred and fifty years, 1824 to 1976. The New South Wales Treasury is examined specifically, as the vehicle for the adaptation and application of those constant principles attaching to the financial administration of the public purse. An examination is also made of the growth of Treasury??s internal structure, leadership, modus operandi, its response to administrative reform and its role in the public service. The inter-play between Treasury, Governors, Colonial Treasurers, and the public service are all vial elements in this exposition of Treasury. This history, therefore, analyses and dissects the influences that provided the impetus for a government agency to develop successfully, from a modest office of three in 1824, into the present day department of state.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative and semi-quantitative modelling and simulation of the software engineering processes</field><field name="creator">Zhang, He, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Software process modelling has been identified as being a vehicle for understanding development processes, controlling development costs, duration, and achieving product quality. In recent years, software process simulation has been becoming one of the essential techniques for effectively investigating and managing software development processes. Till now, most researches focus on the quantitative aspects of process simulation and modelling. Nevertheless, purely quantitative process modelling requires a very detailed understanding and accurate measurement of the software process, which relies on reliable and precise historical data. When such data are lacking or the quality is dubious, quantitative models have to impose severe constraints that restrict the model's value. Unfortunately, these data are not readily available in most cases, especially in the organisations at low process maturity levels. In addition, software development is a highly complex, human-centred endeavour, which involves many uncertain factors in the course of development process. Facing the inherent uncertainty and contingency, though quantitative modelling employs statistic techniques, its conditional capability and underlying assumptions limit its performance on large scale problems.  As the alternatives of quantitative approaches, qualitative modelling can cope with a lack of complete knowledge, and predicts qualitative process behaviours. Furthermore, semi-quantitative modelling offers the capability of handling process uncertainty with limited knowledge, and achieves tradeoff between quantitative and qualitative approaches. However, most previous researches omitted these approaches, and the associated methods and applications are far from developed.  The main contribution of this research lies in the pioneering work on the models, methods, and applications of qualitative and semi-quantitative software process modelling and simulation, and their relations with the conventional, quantitative modelling approaches.  This dissertation produces its novelty from twofold research. Firstly, it explores methods and techniques to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively model and simulate software processes at different levels, i.e. project, portion of development process, and product evolution. Secondly, Some exclusive applications of these modelling approaches are also developed for aspects of software engineering practice. Moreover, a proposed framework integrates these approaches with typical quantitative paradigms to guide the adoption of process simulation modelling in software organisations. As a comprehensive reflection of state-of-the-art of software process simulation modelling, a systematic review is reported in this dissertation as well.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systematic review</field><field name="subject">Software process</field><field name="subject">Modelling and simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Belief driven autonomous manipulator pose selection for less controlled environments</field><field name="creator">Webb, Stephen Scott, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new approach for selecting a manipulator arm configuration (a pose) in an environment where the positions of the work items are not able to be fully controlled. The approach utilizes a belief formed from a priori knowledge, observations and predictive models to select manipulator poses and motions.  Standard methods for manipulator control provide a fully specified Cartesian pose as the input to a robot controller which is assumed to act as an ideal Cartesian motion device. While this approach simplifies the controller and makes it more portable, it is not well suited for less-controlled environments where the work item position or orientation may not be completely observable and where a measure of the accuracy of the available observations is required. The proposed approach suggests selecting a manipulator configuration using two types of rating function. When uncertainty is high, configurations are rated by combining a belief, represented by a probability density function, and a value function in a decision theoretic manner enabling selection of the sensor??s motion based on its probabilistic contribution to information gain. When uncertainty is low the mean or mode of the environment state probability density function is utilized in task specific linear or angular distances constraints to map a configuration to a cost. The contribution of this thesis is in providing two formulations that allow joint configurations to be found using non-linear optimization algorithms. The first formulation shows how task specific linear and angular distance constraints are combined in a cost function to enable a satisfying pose to be selected. The second formulation is based on the probabilistic belief of the predicted environment state. This belief is formed by utilizing a Bayesian estimation framework to combine the a priori knowledge with the output of sensor data processing, a likelihood function over the state space, thereby handling the uncertainty associated with sensing in a less controlled environment. Forward models are used to transform the belief to a predicted state which is utilized in motion selection to provide the benefits of a feedforward control strategy. Extensive numerical analysis of the proposed approach shows that using the fed-forward belief improves tracking performance by up to 19%. It is also shown that motion selection based on the dynamically maintained belief reduces time to target detection by up to 50% compared to two other control approaches. These and other results show how the proposed approach is effectively able to utilize an uncertain environment state belief to select manipulator arm configurations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Belief driven control</field><field name="subject">Manipulator pose selection</field><field name="subject">Bayesian estimation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing brush: an exploration of Taoist aesthetics</field><field name="creator">Yeh, Yi-Lan, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dancing Brush video installation is dedicated to legendary Taiwanese dancer Tsai Jui-Yue (1921-2005) in the memory of her suffering, creativity and faith in life.

The research was conducted in three dimensions: ??non-linear aesthetics?? in Chinese arts as the new media art form, ??unity of emptiness and fullness?? as the animation principle, and ??subtraction aesthetics?? as the principle of creativity. I propose Dancing Brush video installation as a presentation of ??aesthetics of wandering contemplation??. The work suggests a feature of Chinese moving image aesthetics as a ??spatial montage?? form of media arts. I applied the Taoist ??decreative-creative process?? as the creative method in which the ??decreative?? process leads to the ??creative??. The ??decreative-creative process?? is based on the Taoist teachings of zi-ran (spontaneity) and wu-wei (non-action). I interpret it as ??subtraction aesthetics: less is more??. The process is to eliminate interferences with restricted narrative format and visual effects, then to receive the immediate presentation of things as pure materials. Through the subtracting process, it gains not less but more. Kong Bai (emptiness or formless) in Chinese art is the result of subtraction aesthetics. It reveals the creative principle derived from the Taoist idea of ??usefulness of useless??. The ??subtracting process?? in creating animation is to bring ??unknown?? to life. The ??image beyond image?? is the product of ??unity of emptiness and full?? where Chinese artistic realm yi-jing is created.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-linear aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Taoist Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">subtractions aesthetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of order: explorations in digital materiality</field><field name="creator">Ballard, Susan Patricia, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Digital art installation is the result of informatic materials entering gallery spaces and challenging the establishment of media forms. This thesis contends that the open, recursive and recombinatory process of looking at digital installation is in fact the result of noisy relations between information and the spatial temporal contexts of the art gallery. In order to focus on the processes of informatic materials within gallery spaces, this thesis identifies four key modulations of noise and materiality ? emergence, feedback, entropy and delay. I demonstrate how these impact on a range of recent digital installations by Australian and New Zealand artists. The lens of digital materiality shifts from an informational context into that of art history where it is found to highlight the systemic relationality of the installation. The thesis opens with a consideration of histories of media-specificity, and argues for a necessary separation of our concepts of media and materiality. This context provides a set of tools by which the remainder of the thesis investigates a range of digital material flows that are not tied to fixed media definitions. I draw on a range of theorists including Umberto Eco, Gilles Deleuze, Claude Shannon and Jack Burnham to further locate these material flows within two strands: experimental sound and information theory. This discussion forms the basis of the thesis? re-appraisal of media distinctions and highlights the complex relationship of informational materials to both sonic and visual histories. The second half of the thesis undertakes an appraisal of emergence, feedback, entropy and delay in specific works and suggests dimensionality, movement and duration as key determinants of the digital installation. These chapters demonstrate that what is at stake in digital installation is the viewer?s implicit role in the shifting relationships of digital materiality. Overall, this thesis presents a framework for emergent materiality in digital installation. I develop a theory of emergent materiality as a process specific to digital installation, and argue that digital installation is in fact a subject-forming assemblage of information-noise in which relations of dimensionality, movement and duration coalesce without cohering. And, within which gallery spaces begin to get noisy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise</field><field name="subject">Digital materiality</field><field name="subject">Media-specificity</field><field name="subject">Digital installation art</field><field name="subject">Experimental film</field><field name="subject">Experimental music</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Media ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Aotearoa</field><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular typing and evolutionary relationships of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi</field><field name="creator">Octavia, Sophie, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The evolutionary relationship between Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, other typhoid-like enteric fever causing serovars and 10 non-Typhoid serovars from S. enterica subspecies I, could not be determined by comparative nucleotide sequences of six genes. Phylogenetic analyses of the dataset showed that the genes of interest underwent frequent recombination, suggesting a low level of clonality within subspecies I of S. enterica. To establish the evolutionary relationships within serovar Typhi, genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) was explored as a marker for both typing purposes and phylogenetic analysis. Thirty eight SNPs were typed in 73 global Typhi isolates, including 18 isolates expressing the special flagellar antigen z66, using restriction enzyme digestion method. The isolates were differentiated into 23 SNP profiles and grouped into four distinct clusters. The z66 isolates were divided into four SNP profiles and were all grouped into one cluster, suggesting a single origin. An alternative SNP typing method using the hairpin real time PCR assay was investigated to type four additional SNPs, termed as biallelic polymorphisms (BiP). These BiPs were found to classify 481 global Typhi isolates into five major clusters (Roumagnac et al., 2006). Typing four BiPs resulted in the identification of four additional SNP profiles. We proposed nine SNPs were required to type Typhi isolates into 13 subclusters for global epidemiology. An enzymatic-based method using CelI nuclease was evaluated to discover more SNPs from other Typhi genomes. The efficiency of the CelI was shown to be unsatisfactory and we were unable to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Nine Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) were typed in the 73 Typhi isolates using fluorescent-labelled universal primers, and analysed on an automated DNA sequencer. Five isolates were unable to give PCR products in one or more VNTR loci. Nine VNTRs could differentiate 68 Typhi isolates into 65 MLVA profiles, suggesting a higher discriminating power than SNP typing. SNPs were shown to be a more appropriate marker for phylogenetic tracing for Typhi while VNTRs were highly discriminating but could not be used to establish the evolutionary relationships of diverse Typhi isolates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SNP</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">Typhi</field><field name="subject">VNTR</field><field name="subject">Molecular typing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IS project evaluation in practice: an actor-network theory account</field><field name="creator">Nagm, Fouad, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The dominant view in the information systems (IS) and software engineering literature is that the application of a rigorous pre-investment evaluation methodology is the key to ensuring the selection of the best IS projects ?? that is those with the highest expected value for the organisation and with the highest probability of success. While the literature is replete with methodologies that take a narrow view of IS evaluation, there is insufficient attention given to the evaluation process itself and to what constitutes successful IS evaluation. Whilst some within IS argue that the development of more elaborate evaluation methodologies, especially calculations of costs and benefits, is necessary for the advancement of the field, many report that it is not methodologies as such that need improvement. What is missing is an understanding of IS evaluation processes in practice and how organisations can adopt and apply evaluation methodologies so as to improve these processes. This thesis aims to provide in-depth knowledge of IS evaluation processes in practice and re-conceptualise the notion of the IS project proposal, the evaluation process and evaluation methodology that reflect the needs and critical issues in practice. These aims are achieved by conducting an in-depth case study of IS project evaluation processes in a company with a history of high success rates of its IS projects ($3 billion worth of successfully delivered IS projects in the past few years). By adopting Actor-Network Theory as a philosophy, approach and theoretical lens to the investigation of IS project evaluation processes in the case company the thesis demonstrates that: a)	IS project proposals are dynamic, evolving and relational entities that become ??focal?? objects around which the actor-networks of aligned interest tend to emerge; b)	that the evaluation process both creates an IS project proposal and its assessment within a core actor-network within which multiple business realities are enacted and continually negotiated; c)	the evaluation methodology plays an important role of an actant (a non-human actor) by acting from a periphery of the core actor-network of an IS project proposal evaluation d)	the evaluation methodology acts on behalf of management to regulate communication within actor-networks, ensure that company strategy is effectively implemented and that different IS Project Proposals are consistently presented in a mutually comparable manner; e)	by defining a series of processes (steps), inscription aids (inscription forms, norms and rules) and mandated checkpoints the evaluation methodology engenders the evaluation process as ??science??; f)	 by allowing a degree of freedom in conducting the evaluation processes the methodology is also enabling the evaluation processes to emerge as ??art?? thus stimulating creativity and innovation, and finally, g)	by balancing the science and the art of IS project proposal evaluation, the methodology is enabling, assisting and inspiring numerous actors in taking on ??journeys?? of IS project proposals and evaluation and thereby making a difference in their business environments. The thesis makes important contributions to knowledge in the IS discipline. Theoretically, the adoption and use of ANT revealed that the IS Project Proposal is not dormant but rather active, and key to the IS evaluation effort. The IS Project Proposal has thus been re-conceptualised as emerging, relational and dynamic. This thesis also makes a contribution to the re-conceptualisation of the evaluation methodology as being multi-purpose and active as it defines the ??science?? and enables the ??art?? in IS evaluation. The thesis also makes a number of contributions to practice, firstly by showing that documents in IS evaluation are not simply ??outputs?? that are archived away, but are active and are used to attract the right stakeholders. Secondly, it reveals that the ultimate success of the IS Proposal relies on finding a balance between the science and the art in IS evaluation and that the evaluation methodology can play a key role in promoting this balance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IS Investment</field><field name="subject">Project Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Actor-Network Theory</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gold and silver nanoparticles: synthesis, characterization and functional properties</field><field name="creator">Kemal, Lydia, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the shape-controlled metal nanoparticles for functional applications, covering the synthesis, characterization and optical properties. Three parts are mainly involved in this work, including, gold worm-like nanoparticles, silver nanoplates, and silver induced selenium nanowires. The first part focuses on a facile synthesis method for shape control of gold nanoparticles by treating an aqueous solution of chloroauric acid with sodium citrate and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), in which those worm-like nanoparticles were investigated by various advanced experimental characterizations combining density function theory (DFT) calculation. These nanoparticles can be used for optical sensing detection of ions in aqueous system. The second part involves the synthesis, growth, and optical properties of silver nanoplates (triangles and circular discs). Such nanoplates could be synthesized by a self-seeding co-reduction method at ambient conditions. In particular, molecular dynamics simulation is used to quantify the interaction energies between surfactant molecules and different facets of silver crystal. Such molecular information, together with measurements using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ultraviolet??visible (UV??vis) spectroscopy, has proven to be useful for understanding the growth mechanisms of silver nanoplates. The third part focuses on the template of silver nanoparticles for generating trigonal selenium (t-Se) nanowires. This technique exhibits some advantages in fabricating t-Se nanostructures, including no need to use stabilizers and sonichemical process and all operations being proceeded in aqueous media and at room temperature. Particularly it can successfully achieve the transformation from amorphous &#945;-Se to crystalline t-Se in aqueous solution and this method would be useful for generating one-dimensional nanostructures with similar lattice parameter(s). It is considered that the technique for the shape-controlled metal nanoparticles can at least partially, be extended to other nanomaterials for functional applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">Silver</field><field name="subject">properties</field><field name="subject">optical</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">application</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of gruesome evidence on juror emotion and decision making</field><field name="creator">Bright, David Anthony, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The programme of research described in this dissertation examines the potential prejudicial impact of gruesome evidence on mock juror decision making.  The dissertation provides a model of the cognitive and emotional processes by which gruesome evidence can influence mock juror judgments.   Five studies will be presented which have examined the influence of gruesome verbal (written) and visual evidence.  Four studies utilised mock trial or simulation methodology utilising written trial transcripts and undergraduate students as mock jurors.   Results suggest that gruesome evidence can cause emotional reactions in mock jurors and that mock jurors who are exposed to gruesome evidence are more likely to find the defendant culpable (in criminal cases) and liable (in civil cases).  The studies evaluated a model which outlines the cognitive and affective processes by which gruesome evidence might influence juror emotion and decision making.  Gruesome evidence presented verbally, such as verbal descriptions of the victim??s injuries, may bias juror decisions toward conviction. Increased estimates of the guilt of the defendant may result when gruesome information is present, especially when the inculpatory evidence is weak overall.  Photographic evidence, irrespective of whether this evidence is neutral or gruesome, can increase the likelihood of conviction.  Admitting gruesome photographic evidence, rather than excluding this evidence, may increase the inculpatory value that jurors ascribe to prosecutorial evidence via the influence of gruesome evidence on the emotional state of jurors. Further, although exposure to any photographs had similar effects on mock juror affect, emotional reactions to gruesome photographic evidence appeared to lead to changes in the assessment of evidence and to an increased likelihood of conviction or liability when compared with neutral and no photographs.  The implications of the results for policy, practice and research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evidence</field><field name="subject">jury</field><field name="subject">gruesome</field><field name="subject">emotion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of fracture mechanics to predict the growth of single and multi-level delaminations and disbonds in composite structures</field><field name="creator">Mikulik, Zoltan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The high stiffness to weight ratio and fatigue resistance make carbon fibre composites suitable for both military and large civil aircraft. The limited ability of current numerical methods to capture the complex growth of damage in laminated composites leads to a conservative design approach applied in today??s composite aircraft structures. The aim of the presented research was to develop an improved methodology for the failure prediction of laminated composites containing delaminations located between arbitrary layers in the laminate, and to extend the investigations to composite structures subjected to barely visible impact damage (BVID).  The advantages of fracture mechanics-based methodologies to predict interlaminar failure in composite structures were identified, from which the crack tip element (CTE) approach and the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) were selected for assessment. Extensive validation of these fracture mechanics methods is presented on a number of composite structures ranging from coupons to large stiffened panels. It was shown that the VCCT was relatively insensitive to the crack front mesh size, whilst predictions using the CTE methodology were significantly influenced by the element size. Based on the obtained results modelling guidelines for the VCCT and CTE were established. Significant contribution of this research to the field of the analysis of composite structures was the development of a novel test method for the evaluation of embedded single and multi-level delaminations. The test procedure of the single delamination specimen was proposed as an analogous test to conventional compression experiments. The transverse test overcame the inherent problems of in-plane compression testing and produced less scatter of experimental measurements. Quantitative analysis of numerical results employing the validated finite element modelling approaches showed that the failure load and location were in agreement with experiments. Furthermore, new modelling techniques for composite structures containing BVID proposed in this research produced good correlation with test data from the compression after impact (CAI) test. The study of BVID provided a significant contribution toward the knowledge of the applicability of implicit FE solvers to predict failure of CAI specimens as well as the criticality of centrally impacted specimens.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VCCT</field><field name="subject">Composite</field><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">Crack tip element</field><field name="subject">Delamination</field><field name="subject">Finite element analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General equilibrium effects of an alternative social security development in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sudarto, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates general equilibrium effects of an alternative social security policy in Indonesia. The study aims to analyse some financial issues of the proposed policy using a dynamic CGE model. The focus is investigating possible tax scenarios to finance the proposed policy and their impacts on the economy. The simulation results suggest that the consumption tax base should be used as the main financing method. This is because based on various simulations the selected consumption taxes have less negative impacts on the economy than the selected income taxes. Those selected consumption taxes more equitably distribute tax burden and improve income inequality in the long run. However, the increasing price because of this policy selection should also be considered seriously. The simulations also include the study of the demographic transition in Indonesia. A view that is common in the literature is that the rapid increase of labor force in the next three decades could raise the proportion of skilled workers in the labor force and enhance the economic growth. Instead the simulations suggest contrary results. When we repeat the tax/transfer simulations with the demographic transition, real GDP per capita and consumption per capita fall further below the baseline projections. Further simulations are conducted to investigate possible policy actions to mitigate the effects of this demographic transition. This study also covers possible allocation decision trade-offs surrounding the proposed social security policy. That is, the trade-offs between universal social pension insurance and universal social health insurance, and between universal tax-financed social security programs and other important development programs. Given the limitation of our study, that all stakeholders have agreed to develop a universal tax-financed social security program, we conclude that universal tax-financed social health insurance should be given more priority than universal tax-financed social pension insurance. The study concludes with some remarks regarding important areas for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social Security</field><field name="subject">Computable General Equilibrium</field><field name="subject">CGE</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and analysis of a photocatalytic bubble column reactor</field><field name="creator">Cox, Shane Joseph, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current work has developed a CFD model to characterise a pseudo-annular photocatalytic bubble column reactor. The model development was divided into three stages. Firstly, hydrodynamic assessment of the multiphase fluid flow in the  vessel, which incorporated residence time distribution analysis both numerically and experimentally for validation purposes. Secondly, the radiation distribution of the UV source was completed. The final stage incorporated the kinetics for the degradation the model pollutant, sodium oxalate. The hydrodynamics were modelled using an Eulerian-Eulerian approach to the multiphase system with the standard k-  turbulence model. This research established that there was significant deviation in the fluid behaviour in the pseudo-annular reactor when compared with traditional cylindrical columns due to the nature of the internal structure. The residence time distribution study showed almost completely mixed flow in the liquid phase, whereas the gas phase more closely represented plug flow behaviour. Whilst there was significant dependence on the superficial gas flow rate the mixing behaviour demonstrated negligible dependence on the liquid superficial velocity or the liquid flow direction, either co- or counter- current with respect to the gas phase. The light distribution was modelled using a conservative variant of the Discrete Ordinate method. The model examined the contribution to the incident radiation within the reactor of both the gas bubbles and titanium dioxide particles. This work has established the importance of the gas phase in evaluating the light distribution and showed that it should be included when examining the light distribution in a gas-liquid-solid three-phase system. An optimal catalyst loading for the vessel was established to be 1g/L. Integration of the kinetics of sodium oxalate degradation was the final step is developing the complete CFD model. Species transport equations were employed to describe the distribution of pollutant concentration within the vessel. Using a response surface methodology it was shown that the reaction rate exhibited a greater dependency on the lamp power that the lamp length, however, the converse was true with the quantum efficiency. This work highlights the complexity of completely modelling a photocatalytic system and has demonstrated the applicability of CFD for this purpose.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Residence time distribution.</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis.</field><field name="subject">CFD.</field><field name="subject">Computational fluid dynamics.</field><field name="subject">Radiation.</field><field name="subject">Bubbles.</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic membranes: formation and characterisation studies</field><field name="creator">Ip, Anita Wai Ching, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dynamic membranes are considered to be an attractive anti-fouling remedy for membrane filtration, because once fouled, they can be removed and reformed in-situ, thereby prolonging the support membrane???s lifetime.  However, large-scale application of dynamic membranes has been limited due to the numerous formation parameters that influence their properties.  This thesis provides better understanding of the mechanisms of the dynamic membrane formation process through fundamental formation and characterisation studies of dynamically formed titanium dioxide membranes in laboratory scale dead-end and crossflow systems.  The dynamic membranes exhibited water fluxes ranging from 30-1147 L/m2h and dextran (500 kDa) rejections as high as 99.9%.  Of the six formation parameters studied, the pH and constant flux conditions had the greatest influence on dynamic membrane properties.  The pH affects dynamic membrane properties by changing particle aggregation prior to dynamic membrane formation, while constant flux conditions affect the drag force on particles during deposition thereby altering cake compressibility.  The advantage of using the novel concept of constant flux formation over traditional constant pressure formation is that it enables greater control of particle deposition during dynamic membrane formation.  Dextran rejection data also suggested the existence of a critical mass loading, above which dynamic membrane flux and rejection properties are reduced.  This thesis also demonstrated the utility of a factorial design experiment for preliminary identification and evaluation of the critical factors affecting dynamic membrane formation, a method which could be invaluable for tailoring dynamic membranes for use in specific applications.  In addition, cake removal data suggested that more than 80% of the dried cake could be removed providing a high potential for membrane regeneration.  For the formation conditions studied, it was concluded that convection was the dominant mechanism governing particle transport during dynamic membrane formation.  The fluxes and cake properties of the dynamic membranes were best described by the resistance-in-series model for simple dead-end microfiltration.  Furthermore, the higher cake void fraction required to fit the experimental data (at low formation pressure or constant flux conditions) with model predictions suggested that the ratio of shear to convection was an important mechanistic parameter determining dynamic membrane properties.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dynamic membranes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive load theory and mathematics education</field><field name="creator">Khateeb, Majeda, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cognitive load theory uses the immense size of human long-term memory and the significantly limited capacity of working memory to design instructional methods. Five basic principles: information store principle, borrowing and reorganizing principle, randomness as genesis principle, narrow limits of change principle, and environmental linking and organizing principle explain the cognitive basics of this theory.  The theory differentiates between three major types of cognitive load: extraneous load that is caused by instructional strategies, intrinsic cognitive load that results from a high element interactivity material and germane load that is concerned with activities leading to learning. Instructional methods designed in accordance with cognitive load theory rely heavily on the borrowing and reorganizing principle, rather than on the randomness as genesis principle to reduce the imposed cognitive load. As learning fractions incorporates high element interactivity, a high intrinsic cognitive load is imposed. Therefore, learning fractions was studied in the experiments of this thesis.  Knowledge held in long-term memory can be used to reduce working memory load via the environmental linking and organizing principle. It can be suggested that if fractions are presented using familiar objects, many of the interacting elements that constitute a fraction might be embedded in stored knowledge and so can be treated as a single element by working memory. Thus, familiar context can be used to reduce cognitive load and so facilitate learning.  In a series of randomized, controlled experiments, evidence was found to argue for a contextual effect. The first three experiments of this thesis were designed to test the main hypothesis that presenting students with worked examples concerning fractions would enhance learning if a real-life context was used rather than a geometric context. This hypothesis was tested using both a visual and a word-based format and was supported by the results.  The last two experiments were intended to test the context effect using either worked examples or problem solving. The results supported the validity of the previous hypothesis using both instructional methods.  Overall, the thesis sheds some light on the advantages of using familiar objects when mastering complex concepts in mathematics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Context effect</field><field name="subject">Cognitive Load Theory</field><field name="subject">Mathematics education</field><field name="subject">Instructional techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Machine learning for automatic classification of remotely sensed data</field><field name="creator">Milne, Linda, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">As more and more remotely sensed data becomes available it is becoming increasingly harder to analyse it with the more traditional labour intensive, manual methods. The commonly used techniques, that involve expert evaluation, are widely acknowledged as providing inconsistent results, at best. We need more general techniques that can adapt to a given situation and that incorporate the strengths of the traditional methods, human operators and new technologies. The difficulty in interpreting remotely sensed data is that often only a small amount of data is available for classification. It can be noisy, incomplete or contain irrelevant information. Given that the training data may be limited we demonstrate a variety of techniques for highlighting information in the available data and how to select the most relevant information for a given classification task. We show that more consistent results between the training data and an entire image can be obtained, and how misclassification errors can be reduced. Specifically, a new technique for attribute selection in neural networks is demonstrated. Machine learning techniques, in particular, provide us with a means of automating classification using training data from a variety of data sources, including remotely sensed data and expert knowledge. A classification framework is presented in this thesis that can be used with any classifier and any available data. While this was developed in the context of vegetation mapping from remotely sensed data using machine learning classifiers, it is a general technique that can be applied to any domain.

However, commercial exploitation of this process is limited by the fact that titania is only active under UV irradiation (wavelength below about 388 nm), which is only less than 5% of solar light energy. Sol-gel synthesised catalyst specimens were characterised to determine the correlation between preparation conditions on morphology (XRD, SEM), optical (bandgap energy level) and physicochemical properties (BET surface area, pore volume, acid site density, acid site strength and type) of the photocatalysts. These spesific properties would then be linked to their photoactivity using aqueous aliphatic and aromatic model pollutants. This study has demonstrated that sol-gel synthesised doped titania photocatalysts, especially Pt/TiO2, may be used to effectively degrade non-volatile acids (DL-malic acid, dichloroacetic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid) under visible light and UV irradiation with significant photoactivity suitable for the solar light application of photocatalytic wastewater treatment. A significant drop in band-gap energy was found for all titania sol-gel catalysts doped with Pt, Co, and Ce with values between 1.41 to 1.78 eV. The BET areas of the photocatalysts were also higher (65-117 m2/g) than that of Degussa P25 (50 m2/g). The visible-light photomineralisation of the three pollutants with Pt-TiO2 specimen were further extended to evaluate the effects of major variables in a bubble-column photoreactor on the photodegradation activities. Those major variables were lamp intensity, oxygen concentration, initial pH, catalyst dosage, and inital pollutant concentration. All the three pollutants seemed to follow the Langmuir-Hinselwood model with dual adsorption sites which implicated a bimolecular surface rate-limiting step probably between the adsorbed organic substrate and a surface hydroxyl (or peroxy) radical. A study of the CeyCoxTi(1-x)O3+d perovskite was conducted to investigate the influence of metal composition and pH on the intrinsic optophysical attributes as well as p-hydroxybenzoic acid degradation under UV irradiation. The perovskite UV photoactivities were lower than that of pure TiO2 likely due to excessive loading (metal content) creating new oxide phases act as electron-hole recombination center, regardless better physicochemical attributes of some of the perovskite samples. The role of aging time and calcination temperature on the sol-gel synthesised TiO2 was also explored. Higher calcination temperature (from 250 to 700 0C) resulted in TiO2 photocatalysts with better crystallinity, which is important for OH group formation as active sites for photodegradation. Despite of some advantages from higher temperature preparation, some detrimental effects such as decreased acidity attributes, surface area, and pore volume were also observed. The significant red-shift of sol-gel synthesized TiO2 into visible light, especially for 250 0C specimen since 600 or 700 0C had extremely low activities, has promising implications that this specimen might be used for solar application to substitute Pt-doped TiO2 in order to produce a more cost effective photocatalyst. Aging period (1 to 14 days) did not have any discernible effect on the band-gap value and acid-site density. Even so, the highest acid site strength was obtained with an aging time of 10 days. From the overall perspective, aging time longer than 3 days did not bring noticeable benefits to both catalyst attributes and photoactivities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sol-gel</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysts</field><field name="subject">TiO2</field><field name="subject">Photodestruction</field><field name="subject">UV</field><field name="subject">Visible-light</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extraction and characterization of major valuable compounds from prawn waste</field><field name="creator">Karuppuswamy, Renuka, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most prawns are prepared as frozen or canned meat and the remaining waste is used as a feed supplement or directly disposed on to the land, which affects the environment. Fresh prawn bio-waste contains protein, astaxanthin, flavor compounds and chitin. The use of chitin in various applications is limited due to its water insolubility. In this research, a new method is developed to prepare water-soluble colloidal chitin (WSCC) from prawn waste.  WSCC having the percentage of degree of deacetylation same with that of chitin follows non-newtonian shear thinning behaviour. The characteristic study showed that the breakage of polymer chains during processing thus reduced the molecular weight and bulk density of WSCC. Therefore, functional properties of WSCC can be controlled by optimizing the processing conditions.  Astaxanthin complex has attracted considerable interest in relation to its health benefits because of its powerful antioxidant activity. Traditional extraction of astaxanthin complex from prawn waste using organic solvents requires post-purification steps, creates solvent disposal problem and degrades the pigment. This research develops an efficient way of recovering astaxanthin complex from prawn waste that eliminates the problems associated with solvent extraction methods and offers possible recyclability of the solvents used. Post-harvest blackening in prawns adversely affects both quality and consumer acceptability. However, consumer safety over the chemicals, especially sulphites used in inhibiting prawn blackening is of a major concern. This study shows that the antioxidant, astaxanthin complex can inhibit the poly phenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzed blackening reaction in prawns. Although prawns have astaxanthin complex present in their natural state, its concentration in vivo may not be sufficient to act against PPO. Therefore, astaxanthin complex-enriched feed in prawn culture may prevent prawn melanosis and may eliminate the post-harvest handling methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prawn waste management.</field><field name="subject">Astaxanthin.</field><field name="subject">Biopolymer.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blast furnace hearth drainage improvement of the residual - flowout correlation</field><field name="creator">Bean, Ian James, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Experimental cold modelling of hearth drainage was performed at Bluescope Steel Research Laboratories to understand the impact of variable drainage rate on slag removal. These drainage studies were designed to simulate real operational aspects such as: continuous casting, variable tapping rate and inflow liquid distribution. During the analysis of these drainage experiments it was demonstrated that the residual-flowout correlation in use since the 1970??s may possibly be incomplete or inaccurate. The removal of slag from the blast furnace hearth is the greater concern of the two liquids produced in the iron making process. In the 1970??s operational difficulties arose when large volumes of residual slag remained in the furnace after casting. This prompted research related to the flow of viscous liquids through uniformly packed beds providing fundamental insight on the most effective means of removal of slag from the blast furnace hearth. The core subject of this study, the residual-flowout correlation developed by Fukutake and Okabe that is used to predict cast duration and liquid accumulation in the blast furnace hearth is discussed in detail. The residual-flowout correlation is examined for four different sets of conditions based on constant or increasing slag drainage, with and without liquid dripping. The outcome of this study will improve our understanding of the residual-flowout relationship and develop it further, so that drainage conditions whether for constant or increasing drainage rates, with or without dripping, will hold using the one general Fl equation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">residual ratio</field><field name="subject">hearth</field><field name="subject">flowout</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self organization in nature</field><field name="creator">McCrea, Genevieve Rosalind, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sand is an appropriate material to embody and make visible the impulses which may pass through the moving hand and also permeate the universe. Its ability to absorb impressions means it can take on the full range of material states, solid, liquid or vapour, and allows it to speak with the rhythmic language the whole of nature itself uses. Developing a language of forms which more closely speaks this rhythmic language of nature requires an intimate knowledge of the processes of nature.  Sand experiments undertaken show the formation a rich array of dazzling patterns.  Chaos theory explains this self organizing capacity, and reveals the depth of interdependence of systems within nature.  The aspect of self-similarity is also of central significance in appreciating how nature looks and function, and thus how it might be imaged. Drawings from nature were developed using sand as a parameter, starting with the single grain and translating the dynamism of moving sand into mark.  Field trips involved looking for waves and repeated lines in nature, and observing how marks form in nature. Chaos theory provides a ground to bring together different spheres of knowledge ?? science, theology and art.  It reveals the peculiarities of a material??s behaviour as being of critical importance in the mechanism of evolution.  It also provides fresh insight into an incarnational Christian theological perspective, and the relational dynamic within the Trinity.  The unity of far and near is also reflected in chaos theory in the self similarity of images. Romantic artists Turner and Van Gogh both engage in the search for a visual language of transcendence through nature using the use of the themes of chaos and order, with an emphasis on physicality and movement.  Contemporary artists Goldsworthy, Blanchflower and Kirkeby ground their work in knowledge of material. Changes from solid and rigid to shifting and open show in the development of my work. The immediacy and dynamism of mark making in drawing and staining, ripping and sanding in painting gives process and materiality greater weight.

It comprises two behavioural experiments undertaken in the context of: (i) wording changes to the audit report (developed product) using shareholders as participants; and (ii) the role of assurance and type of assurance provider for corporate social responsibility reporting (evolving product), using financial analysts as participants. In both studies effectiveness of communication is examined in terms of report users?? perceptions and investment decision-making. The theoretical framework used in these studies is adapted from a communications model developed by Shannon and Weaver (1949), and supplemented by psychology research focused on source credibility (Birnbaum and Stegner, 1979). Two key elements of the communication process are recognised; the: (i) message transmitted; and (ii) source of the message. The first element is considered in the first experiment; the second element in the second study. Useful feedback is provided to standard-setters. From the first study, report users?? perceptions are not impacted by changes to the wording of the audit report. However, in the second experiment they are affected by differences in the source of the message. In terms of trustworthiness, financial analysts perceive the credibility of the source of corporate social responsibility information to be significantly greater when assured. For a company in an industry with stronger incentives to report positive corporate social responsibility information, they perceive the credibility (trustworthiness, overall credibility) of the source of the information to be significantly greater when assured. They also discern differences between types of assuror whereby the credibility (trustworthiness, expertise, overall credibility) of the source of information is perceived to be greater when assured by a professional accountant than a sustainability expert. A contribution of these experiments is the analysis of report users?? investment decision-making, as well as their perceptions. Differences in the message and source of the message for assurance reporting have no impact on report users?? investment decisions. Differences in characteristics of report users (familiarity with reports, extent to which reports are understandable) appear to impact report users?? perceptions and merits further examination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate Social Responsibility</field><field name="subject">Assurance Reporting</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liszt's technical studies: a methodology for the attainment of pianistic virtuosity</field><field name="creator">Goodchild, Neil John, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In 1970, the Hungarian publishing firm Editio Musica Budapest began a long term project, ending in 2005, that endeavored to compile and publish all Liszt's works in a complete edition titled, The New Liszt Edition (NLE). Through the efforts of this firm, Liszt's Technical Studies were published in the way that he had originally intended for the first time in 1983. Yet, although the eminent Liszt-scholar Michael Saffle has stated that 'Pedagogy is one of the most thoroughly-mined veins of Liszt material ever uncovered', academic discussions on Liszt's Technical Studies (Walker, 2005), his definitive pedagogical work for piano, are scarce. What it was that Liszt set out as being fundamental to the acquisition of pianistic virtuosity in the Technical Studies and the nature of its trajectory is generally unknown. Through an examination of the didactic instruction Liszt supplied in the Preface of the autograph manuscript to the Technical Studies and specific technical commentaries written by Mme. Auguste Boissier in her Liszt pedagogue, I will argue that the Technical Studies are built on six artistic and mechanical principles, exemplified by Liszt in the exercises, written to help the pianist acquire technical virtuosity. The methodical divisions of the work into sections that deal with specific mechanical objectives are illustrated with musical examples and their technical trajectory defined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liszt, Franz, 1811-1886 -- Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Piano -- Methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The internationalisation processes of cultural firms: a case of MBC, Korea</field><field name="creator">Choi, Tae Young, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The words ??Globalisation?? and ??Internationalisation?? have received a great deal of interest from global nations, enterprises, citizens and academics especially since the late 20th century. Although the process of globalization began as a social trend for tracking the expansion of human population and the growth of civilization since as early as the 16th century, globalization became a business phenomenon in the 19th century from rapid growth in international trade and investment between the European imperial powers, its colonies and, later, the United States. Scholars of the 20th century vigorously attempted to theorise internationalisation of multinational enterprises (MNEs) based on MNEs?? internationalisation processes. As the vast majority of such theories were developed for the manufacturing industry, the validity of theories for the service industry became ambiguous. Despite the fact that one of the fastest growing sectors of global trade since the late 20th century is the trade in cultural goods and services, scholars haven??t attempted to validate such a phenomenon by reference to existing theories of internationalisation processes. This thesis attempts to dismantle the internationalisation processes of cultural firms and to explore the validity of existing internationalisation theories. Due to the inherent difficulties in analysing all sectors of cultural industries, this thesis has adopted a single in-depth case study method with qualitative data to support the findings of the thesis. Although the internationalisation processes of a firm consist of an abundant series of intermittent and continuous ventures by the firm, the particular focus of this thesis is on the longitudinal processes of a firm??s overall internationalisation processes. As one of the foremost runners of ??Hallyu ?? Korean Wave?? phenomenon, MBC has been selected as a case study object for this thesis. With a history of internationalisation processes over 40 years, involving various internal and external environmental factors/forces interactively, the case of MBC offers an insight into the empirical study of the internationalisation processes of cultural firms. Although this thesis shows strong support for the dynamic capabilities theory??a theory that explains dynamic activities and behaviours of MBC??s internationalisation processes in accordance with, and as a result of, ever-changing both internal and external factors/forces of environments??dynamic capability theory itself is deficient in explaining the underlying sources and drivers of those factors/forces. In order to overcome such a shortfall, this thesis suggests an integrative approach of integrating multidisciplinary theories as a theoretical framework for future studies of internalisation processes theories especially for empirical and industry-specific studies. This thesis provides comprehensive framework for three components??motives, way-stations and performance??of internationalisation processes of cultural firms, thereby contributing to the under-researched field in the discipline of international business.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategy</field><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Processes</field><field name="subject">Culture Industry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development, evaluation and application of a geographic information retrieval system</field><field name="creator">Hu, You-Heng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) systems provide users with functionalities of representation, storage, organisation of and access to various types of electronic information resources based on their textual and geographic context. This thesis explores various aspects of the development, evaluation and application of GIR systems.  The first study focuses upon the extraction and grounding of geographic information entities. My approach for this study consists of a hierarchical structure-based geographic relationship model that is used to describe connections between geographic information entities, and a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to resolve ambiguities. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a toponym disambiguation task using a large collection of news articles.  The second study details the development and validation of a GIR ranking mechanism. The proposed approach takes advantage of the power of the Genetic Programming (GP) paradigm with the aim of finding an optimal functional form that integrates both textual and geographic similarities between retrieved documents and a given user query. My approach has been validated by applying it to a large collection of geographic metadata documents. The third study addresses the problem of modelling the GIR retrieval process that takes into account both thematic and geographic criteria. Based on the Spreading Activation Network (SAN), the proposed model consists a two-layer associative network that is used to construct a structured search space; a constrained spreading activation algorithm that is used to retrieve and to rank relevant documents; and a geographic knowledge base that is used to provide necessary domain knowledge for network. The retrieval performance of my model has been evaluated using the GeoCLEF 2006 tasks.  The fourth study discusses the publishing, browsing and navigation of geographic information on the World Wide Web. Key challenges in designing and implementing of a GIR user interface through which online content can be systematically organised based on their geospatial characteristics, and can be efficiently accessed and interrelated, are addressed. The effectiveness and the usefulness of the system are shown by applying it to a large collection of geo-tagged web pages.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Retrieval</field><field name="subject">Geographic Information Retrieval</field><field name="subject">Geographic Information</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of circumcision and pharyngeal STIs in HIV and STI transmission among homosexual men</field><field name="creator">Templeton, David James, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents data on two separate areas relevant to the prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission in homosexual men. These data arise from the community-based Health in Men (HIM) cohort of HIV-negative homosexual men in Sydney. First, the association of circumcision status with HIV and STIs was examined. Older age, ethnicity and country of birth were demographic factors independently associated with circumcision status. Self-report was a valid measure of circumcision status in this population. Overall, being circumcised was associated with a non-significant reduced risk of HIV seroconversion in the HIM cohort (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.41-1.41, p=0.381). Among the one-third of participants predominantly practising the insertive role in anal intercourse (AI), being circumcised was associated with a significantly reduced risk of HIV infection (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.80, p=0.026). Circumcised HIM participants also had a lower risk of incident syphilis (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.84, p=0.019), however circumcision status had no significant effect on the remainder of prevalent and incident STIs examined. Second, risk factors for pharyngeal gonorrhoea and chlamydia were investigated. The BD ProbeTec nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) had a positive predictive value (PPV) for pharyngeal gonorrhoea diagnosis of only 30.4% (95% CI 25.2-36.1%) when compared to a previously validated NAAT targeting the gonococcal porA pseudogene. Pharyngeal gonorrhoea was common in HIM, mostly occurred without concurrent anogenital infection and may frequently spontaneously resolve. Infection was independently associated with younger age (p-trend=0.001), higher number of male partners (p-trend=0.002), contact with gonorrhoea (p&lt;0.001) and insertive oro-anal sex with casual partners (p-trend=0.044). Pharyngeal chlamydia was less common but a high prevalence/incidence ratio suggested that infection may persist in the pharynx for long periods. Pharyngeal chlamydia was independently associated with receptive penile-oral sex with casual partners (p-trend=0.009). In conclusion, circumcision may have a role as an HIV prevention intervention among the subgroup of homosexual men who predominantly practise insertive rather than receptive AI. Regular screening of the pharynx including a validated supplemental NAAT for gonorrhoea diagnosis may prevent much transmission to anogenital sites, whereas chlamydia occurs too infrequently in the pharynx to recommend routine screening in homosexual men.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sexually transmitted infections</field><field name="subject">homosexuality, male</field><field name="subject">circumcision</field><field name="subject">human immunodeficiency virus</field><field name="subject">pharyngeal gonorrhoea</field><field name="subject">pharyngeal chlamydia</field><field name="subject">prospective studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attraction, affiliation and disenchantment in a new religious movement:  a study of individuals?? experiences in a  Siddha Yoga practice</field><field name="creator">Healy, John Paul, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores thirty-two individuals?? experiences of involvement in Siddha Yoga. Such groups have often been labelled as cults and accused of ??brainwashing?? their followers. The conceptualisation of affiliation as brainwashing has been influential within the helping professions, including psychology, counselling and social work. However, this conceptualisation is not supported by empirical research on cults, or what have become known as New Religious Movements (NRMs). The research problem which this thesis addresses therefore is: ??If a brainwashing model of affiliation does not give an adequate explanation for cult/NRM involvement how else might it be understood???  A primary objective of this study was to inform the helping professions, in particular social work. A secondary objective was to add to knowledge about Siddha Yoga Practice in Australia, which no other study had addressed, and thereby to add to the growing understanding of NRMs in Australia. The study applied a qualitative research framework, informed by grounded theory, ethnography and phenomenology and used a purposive sampling technique. Materials were collected by semi-structured in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes, and analysed with the assistance of NVivo data analysis computer software. This study found that the conceptualisation of affiliation as brainwashing fails to account for the variety of individuals?? experiences of involvement in Siddha Yoga. Moreover, the findings highlight that involvement in regard to attraction, affiliation and disenchantment is not helpfully understood by adopting a ??brainwashing?? model and could be better understood through the lens of the sociology of religion, including studies of the experiences of those in mainstream religions.  One implication of the findings for social work and other helping professions is that existing approaches to interpersonal helping could be used with individuals who seek assistance after leaving a NRM. For social work, this thesis also adds to the growing knowledge of the diverse religious orientations in the wider community. Such knowledge can enhance social work education, practice and theory in relation to social work??s diverse client population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">cults</field><field name="subject">New Religious Movements</field><field name="subject">brainwashing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells for the treatment of type 1 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Lees, Justin Guy, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">A five stage selection protocol originally applied to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) was examined for the derivation of insulin producing cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Insulin gene expression was observed and insulin protein was measured by radioimmunoassay. However, the radioimmunoassay results were shown to be susceptible to false positive findings due to the presence of exogenous insulin within differentiation media and it was concluded that this particular strategy was not ideal for the derivation of insulin producing cells from hESCs. An investigation was then undertaken regarding the in vivo differentiation of cells derived from hESCs seeded within 3D scaffolds to determine if this would result in the derivation of insulin producing cells. Within scaffolds there were abundant cells which stained positively for ectoderm lineage markers including nestin. Cells which stained positively for markers of endothelial progenitors representing the mesoderm lineage were also observed and rare cells stained for endoderm markers including insulin. These investigations also demonstrated that transplanting scaffolds seeded with cells derived from hESCs between the liver lobules of immunodeficient mice could lead to the formation of teratomas. Factors that may have influence the formation of teratomas were further investigated and it was demonstrated that teratoma formation was inhibited by altering in vitro treatment of cells. An in vitro investigation was then performed to determine the extracellular matrix (ECM) producing capacity of hESCs and differentiated cells derived from hESCs because ECM proteins are required for the formation of 3D structures similar to pancreatic islets. The results from this investigation indicated that differentiated cells produced multiple ECM proteins at substantially higher levels than hESCs. The ECM producing differentiated cells could be useful in the development of surrogate islet like tissue by supplying a suitable ECM structure within a 3D scaffold environment to aid the function of ??-cell surrogates. Furthermore, these differentiated cells derived from hESCs were shown to produce an adhesive basement membrane in vitro, which is derived from human sources, and could be utilized in the derivation, propagation and differentiation of hESCs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulin</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Stem cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and correction of DEM generation from airborne and space borne radar systems with reference to geo-hazard identification in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia.</field><field name="creator">Ahmad, Baharin Bin, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research assesses the accuracy of SRTM and AIRSAR DEMs acquired over the mountainous-hillands of Cameron Highlands with DEMs generated from Digital Aerial Photograph (DAP) with a fine (2 m) spatial resolution and height resolution of about 0.5 m. The ground control points used for generating stereo models from the DAP were acquired during field work using GPS which achieved accuracy better than 2 cm in most cases. To overcome the difficulty of overlaying the DEMs with the DAP DEM as no features can be easily identified on both the images, therefore a technique of using transects and contours generated from the DEMs were used to correct the horizontal displacement. For AIRSAR DEM, comparing the accompanying AIRSAR composite images was also employed. These then allowed an analysis of the height accuracy to be undertaken. The height of both the AIRSAR and SRTM DEMs were also corrected by applying Linear Regression Models. These models were produced by comparing pixels obtained from points, profiles and an area. Once again the corrected DEMs were assessed. Finally the extracted profiles and contours from the corrected SRTM and AIRSAR were compared with the reference DEM. From the comparisons, the horizontal errors were found to be about one and the half pixels (138.72 m: for SRTM) to the east and 1 pixel (10 m: for AIRSAR) to the south. The SD of height differences of the SRTM and AIRSAR DEMs using 90% data were 9.2 m and 5.2 m with profiles comparison; 10.4 m and 5.4 m with area comparison; 10.8 m and 2.4 m with GPS GCPs comparison respectively. From the three comparisons, the means of height differences are 5.2 m, 6.1 m and 15.2 m for SRTM and 8.1 m, 8.3 m and 7.9 m for AIRSAR DEM. The results suggest there is height offset in the AIRSAR DEM. When both heights of DEMs were corrected, the generated contours are close to each other and to reference contours. Using contour colours images and height modelling, the corrected DEM was found to have the potential to detect areas that prone to flash floods and mudslides.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">InSAR</field><field name="subject">AIRSAR</field><field name="subject">SRTM</field><field name="subject">DEM</field><field name="subject">Aerial Photograph</field><field name="subject">Digital mapping</field><field name="subject">Surveying -- Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of inhibitors of leukaemia with translocatins involving the mixed lineage leukaemia oncogene</field><field name="creator">Kwek, Chin Kiat, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common childhood cancer with cure rates of approximately 80%. This success can be  attributed to the introduction of risk stratification for patients and employment of intensified treatment regimes for patients with high risk disease. However, the identification of prognostically important leukaemia subtypes, unfortunately, is an labour-intensive process. In addition, despite the success in treating childhood ALL, specific subgroups of patients nevertheless still have poor survival rates. This is particularly true for leukaemias characterised by chromosomal translocations involving the MLL oncogene on chromosome 11q23. By using a novel bioinformatics approach, GeneRave, a set of 12 classifier genes (PTPRK, FOS, ENG, Lgal-S1, TCFL5, LRMP, CTGF, IGJ, MX1, PENK, CD3D and HBG1) was selected from a publicly available U95 Affymetrix microarray dataset. Real time PCR carried out on a blinded cohort of 58 primary ALL samples yielded an accuracy of 86%. The absence of PENK gene expression in the majority of ALL samples tested appears to have decreased the overall accuracy. Nevertheless, the results indicate that this method of classification can be easily and quickly performed and therefore may be useful as an adjunct to routinely used methodology in the diagnostic classification of childhood ALL. Parellal screening of a 34,000 chemical small molecules library identified 30 ???hits??? that exhibited specificity toward leukaemia, and many of which shared structural similarity. The cytotoxic effect of these compounds was further investigated in a panel of 19 cell lines that included 3 MLL-translocated (MV411, THP-1 and PER-485), 7 non-MLL-translocated leukaemias (REH, Jurkat, K562, HL60, Hal-01, UOB-B, NB4), 2 immortalized normal blood cell lines, 4 non-leukaemic tumour cell lines (Calu6, MCF7, BE(2)-C, and HeLa) and 3 normal cell lines (HSF, MCF10a and MRC5). In particular, two compounds were identified, SM6 and SM7, that were highly effective at killing MLL-translocated cell lines in the low micromolar range while having little or no effect on the other cell lines. Treatment of PER-485 cells with SM6 and SM7 showed mark down-regulation of the MLL chimaeric fusion protein together with its down-stream targets.

Given the importance of SAMD prediction, and the limitations posed by current methods, four research questions are addressed: &#149;What are the key challenges in meso-level SAMD prediction? &#149;What variables affect SAMD prediction? &#149;What techniques can be used to improve SAMD prediction? &#149;What is the value of integrating these techniques to improve SAMD prediction?  To answer these questions, possible solutions from two broad areas are examined: spatial analysis and data mining.  The research is divided into two main studies. In the first study, a seven-step modelling process is developed for SAMD prediction. Several sets of models are analysed to examine the modelling techniques&#146; effectiveness in improving the accuracy of SAMD prediction. The second study involves two cases to: 1) explore the integration of these techniques and their advantages in SAMD prediction; and 2) gain insights into spatial marketing issues.  The case study of Peugeot in the Sydney metropolitan area shows that urbanisation and geo-marketing factors can have a more important role in SAMD prediction than socio-demographic factors. Furthermore, results show that modelling spatial effects is the most important aspect of this prediction exercise. The value of the integration of techniques is in compensating for the weaknesses of conventional techniques, and in providing complementary and supplementary information for meso-level marketing analyses.

In so doing, it argues that conventional approaches misinterpret key feature of the civil wars in the &#147;Greater Mano River Area&#148; which includes Liberia, Sierra Leone and C??te d&#146;Ivoire. It demonstrates that the progression and spread of conflict is engendered primarily by transversal political structures. The thesis utilises a critical international society approach to consider patterns of security and insecurity across the sub-region of West Africa. However, rather than accepting that West African politics operates within a single, comprehensive international society, it argues instead that it should be understood at two levels. One level is state-centric international society, where West African inter-state relations can largely be explained according to existing constructivist paradigms. At the second level is &#147;transversal&#148; society that cuts across state borders, generating a regional, normative structure that prescribes and constrains behaviour within and between communities outside of the international society framework.  The thesis proceeds in two parts. In the first section it works towards an understanding of the transversal politics of regional conflict in the Greater Mano River Area. Conflict is nominally internal, and centralised state authority is the object of both attack and transformation. However, a close examination of civil violence in Liberia, Sierra Leone and C??te d&#146;Ivoire reveals that it cannot be completely understood without recognising the non-state structures of authority and domination that disrupt the traditional domestic/international divide. The transversal communities generated by conflict create a regional cycle of violence that is resistant to efforts made to resolve it. The second section of the thesis is concerned with the ability of ECOWAS to foster durable peace. As West Africa&#146;s key regional organisation, ECOWAS would seem well-placed to respond to regional conflict. It is well-integrated, has significant normative legitimacy and has developed sophisticated security mechanisms. Critically however, as it was created within inter-state international society, ECOWAS is limited by its assumption that states are and should remain unitary actors. Its failure ultimately lies in its inability to respond to the alternative political contours of transversal communities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">transversal</field><field name="subject">West Africa</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimised reduction of the radiated noise from the casing of a constant speed gearbox</field><field name="creator">Shen, Anne, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting and minimising the noise radiated from a constant speed gearbox assembly by means of attaching optimally placed stiffening ribs on the casing. The procedure involves building an FE model of the gearbox, which is updated using modal parameters extracted from a modal test. This is followed by synthesis of the required FRFs with respect to the forcing degrees-of-freedom. The forces, which are assumed to act only at the bearings are identified from these FRFs and the measured operational velocities of the casing. The identified forces are then used to excite the updated FE model to re-calculate the vibration velocities. A boundary element method is used to calculate the final radiated sound power to be compared with that measured. The same forces are used later to excite the modified gearbox casing to determine the improvement given by optimised modification. The optimisation study minimises the vibration energy of the casing in  10% bands around critical frequencies, in this case the first two harmonics of the gearmesh frequency. To allow for errors in the model, the excitation is by white noise, so as to produce wide stop bands, rather than minimising the response at particular frequencies. The vibration energy is weighted for radiation efficiency, A-weighting, and relative source strength in the bands. The final optimal stiffener layout is validated through a final vibration and acoustic calculation on the updated gearbox model using the forces identified in the earlier steps. The study of one particular gearbox concludes that i) the proposed hybrid optimisation scheme produces a theoretical effective noise reduction of 3 dBA for the total sound power. ii) Because the gearmesh harmonics were targeted, a further 5 dB improvement was effectively gained by eliminating the tonal penalty which otherwise applied. iii) From plate studies it was demonstrated that the stiffening ribs could be attached using epoxy cement (to avoid welding) and that the properties of the cemented joint could be determined by model updating after attaching one rib, so as to obtain a better prediction of the final optimised result.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reduction</field><field name="subject">Gearbox</field><field name="subject">Radiated noise</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Punishment and imprisonment in New South Wales: towards a conceptual analysis of purpose</field><field name="creator">Sotiri, Melinda, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research conducts a conceptual and qualitative investigation into the practices, rationales and functions of imprisonment in NSW. A specific system of imprisonment, in this case the prisons operated by the NSW Department of Corrective services, is explored in order to examine the practices, processes and justifications for incarceration. The various purposes, theories, rhetorics, practices and contradictions of the prison system in NSW and the ways in which the people who are responsible for the administration of this system make sense of its operations and its incoherencies, are central to this analysis.  This research utilises a hybrid methodology involving aspects of content analysis and grounded theory. At the centre of this research are eight interviews with senior NSW Corrective Services staff. This analysis is supplemented by interview with ex-prisoners, and other people familiar with, but not working for Corrective Services. In addition a documentary analysis of both Corrective Services documents, and external literature examining NSW prison is carried out.  The findings of these analyses are then explored with reference to both their internal coherency, as well as their relationship to a range of theoretical frameworks. The thesis connects abstract and philosophical questions of punishment and penalty with the logistics of running the prison system in NSW. This research found a diversity of practices, understandings and justifications of imprisonment which connected to particular cultural, social philosophical and structural trends. These included victimary discourses, the rhetoric of progress, the influence of managerialism, the faith in ???objective??? professionals, the increasing emphasis on empiricism, the conflicts between coercive practices and individual responsibility, the construction of prisoners as dangerous, and an ongoing struggle for purpose. Imprisonment in NSW was found to be characterised by discrepancies between the intentions of its administrators and pragmatics of its practice, conflicts between internal explanations of its purpose, as well as contradictions between internal Corrective Services accounts and external expectations about the roles, functions and practices of imprisonment. Theoretical perspectives explaining why these characterise imprisonment in NSW were developed. These perspective include the ???ought/is??? confusion of penal administrators, the inhumanity of humane containment, the myth of technocratic amorality, and the sedimentation of purpose.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Punishment -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Imprisonment -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of vein graft haemodynamics using computational fluid dynamics techniques.</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Mark John, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of mortality in Western societies, affects large elastic arteries, causing focal deposition of proliferative inflammatory and lipid-laden cells within the artery. Several risk factors have been causally implicated in the ???reaction to injury??? hypothesis first described by Ross in 1969. The ???injury??? sustained by endothelial cells may be either mechanical or chemical. Environmental factors have a role in the production of chemical agents that are injurious to the endothelium. Mechanical stresses such as wall tensile stress are proportional to systemic blood pressure and pulse pressure. Essentially, these systemic pressures are fairly evenly distributed throughout the circulation. However, atherosclerotic lesions characteristically occur at focal sites within the human vasculature; at or near bifurcations, within the ostia of branch arteries and at regions of marked or complex curvature, where local haemodynamic abnormalities occur. The most discussed haemodynamic factor seems to be low or highly oscillating wall shear stress which exists on the outer wall of bifurcations and on the inner aspect of curving vessels. The magnitude of these haemodynamic forces may not be great but the subtleties of their variable spatial distribution may help to explain the multifocal distribution of atherosclerotic plaques. With the altered haemodynamics there is endothelial injury and phenotypic changes in the endothelium result, which in turn lead to endothelial cell dysfunction. These haemodynamic variables are difficult to measure directly in vivo. In this work a novel model is developed utilising human autologous vein bypass grafts as a surrogate vessel for the observation of pathological structural changes in response to altered haemodynamics. The influence of haemodynamic factors (such as wall shear stress) in the remodeling of the vein graft wall and the pathogenesis of Myointimal Hyperplasia (MIH) and resultant wall thickening in femoral bypass grafts is analysed. The haemodynamic determinants of MIH (which have been established in many animal models) are similar to those implicated in atherosclerosis. The accelerated responses of the vein (Intimal hyperplasia develops much more rapidly than atherosclerotic lesions in native vessels) make it an ideal model to expediently examine the hypothesised relationships prospectively in an in vivo setting.  Furthermore, the utilisation of in vivo data acquired from non-invasive diagnostic methods (such as Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Duplex ultrasound) combined with the application of state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques makes the model essentially non-invasive. The following hypotheses are examined: 1) regions of Low shear and High tensile stress should develop disproportionately greater wall thickening, 2) regions of greater oscillatory blood flow should develop greater wall thickening, and 3) regions of lower wall shear should undergo inward (or negative) remodelling and result in a reduction in vessel calibre. The conclusions reached are that abnormal haemodynamic forces, namely low Time-averaged Wall Shear Stress, are associated with subsequent wall thickening. These positive findings have great relevance to the understanding of vein graft MIH and atherosclerosis. It was also evident that with non-invasive data and CFD techniques, some of the important haemodynamic factors are realistically quantifiable (albeit indirectly). The detection of parameters known to be causal in the development of graft intimal hyperplasia or other vascular pathology may improve ability to predict clinical problems. From a surgical perspective this might be employed to facilitate selection of at-risk grafts for more focused postoperative surveillance and reintervention. On a broader stage the utilisation of such analyses may be useful in predicting individuals at greater risk of developing atherosclerotic deposits, disease progression, and the likelihood of clinical events such as heart attack, stroke and threat of limb loss.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vascular surgery.</field><field name="subject">Haemodynamics.</field><field name="subject">Bypass graft.</field><field name="subject">Intimal hyperplasia.</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis.</field><field name="subject">Veins.</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of compressible cake behaviour in submerged membrane filtration for water treatment</field><field name="creator">Santiwong, Suvinai Rensis, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study, Smiles?? sorptivity-diffusivity numerical analysis is demonstrated to offer a comprehensive description of dead-end constant-pressure compressible cake filtration for water treatment. In addition to providing an insight on filtration performance and cake behaviour in terms of cake hydraulic permeability and compressibility in good agreement with the results derived using Ruth??s conventional cake filtration theory, the sorptivity-diffusivity model can be used to gain further information on depth-dependent local cake properties and extend our knowledge on the effect of feed suspension conditions (including solution composition, coagulant dosage and mixing) on the characteristics of the particulate assemblages (including size, structure and strength).  Feed suspension conditions and primary particle properties exert significant effect on the characteristics of particles in suspensions and the resultant particulate assemblages. In the non-coagulated latex systems, an increase in ionic strength resulted in a suppression of the electric double layer of latex particles as indicated by a significant drop in the zeta potential of the feed suspension which lead to a dramatic reduction in cake hydraulic permeability. In the non-coagulated montmorillonite systems, feed suspensions with high ionic strength (1 M Na+, 50 mM Ca2+ and 50 mM Fe2+) were associated with larger suspended solids which appeared to form assemblages with nematic structures that are denser yet more permeable when compared to those with low ionic strength (0.1 M Na+, 1 mM Ca2+ and 2 mM Fe2+) which appeared to form highly ??cross-linked?? voluminous honeycomb type gel of very low permeability.  Pre-coagulation of latex and montmorillonite suspensions with Al-based coagulants (alum and ACH) both resulted in formation of very large flocs which subsequently formed highly permeable solid assemblages. In the latex systems, the ratio of optimal alum to ACH dose was approximately 5:1 on a total coagulant mass basis and 1.3:1 as Al while the ratio of optimal alum to ACH dose was as high as 22:1 on a total coagulant mass basis and 6:1 as Al in the montmorillonite systems. Although both alum and ACH resulted in comparable filtration performances, the distinction in Al concentration and results of local cake properties analysis indicated the presence of different cake structures presumably due to the formation of different Al species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cake structure</field><field name="subject">Compressible cake</field><field name="subject">Membrane filtration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E-health readiness assessment from EHR perspective</field><field name="creator">Li, Junhua, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many countries (especially developing countries) are plagued with critical healthcare issues such as chronic, infectious and pandemic diseases, a lack of basic healthcare programmes and facilities and a shortage of skilled healthcare workers. E-Health (healthcare based on the Internet technologies) promises to overcome some problems related to the reach of healthcare in remote communities. Electronic Health Record (EHR) (consisting of all diagnostic information related to a patient) forms the core of any E-Health system. Hence the success of an E-Health system is very much dependent on the success of the EHR systems. Although interest in automating the health record is generally high, the literature informs us that they do not always succeed in terms of adoption rate and/or acceptance, even in developed countries. The success of the adoption tends to be low for resource constrained (e.g. insufficient E-Health infrastructure) developing countries. As part of the effort to enhance EHR acceptance, readiness assessment for the innovation becomes an essential requirement for the successful implementation and use of EHR (and hence E-Health). Based on a thorough literature review, several research gaps have been identified. In order to address these gaps, this thesis (based on design science research methodology) presents E-Health Readiness Assessment Methodology (EHRAM). It involves a new E-Health Readiness Assessment Framework (EHRAF), an assessment process and several techniques for analysing the assessment data to arrive at a readiness score. The EHRAF (Model) integrates the components from healthcare providers?? and organisational perspectives of existing E-Health readiness evaluation frameworks. The process of EHRAM (Method) starts with the development of a set of hierarchical evaluation criteria based on EHRAF. This leads to the questionnaire development for data collection. The data is analysed in EHRAM using a number of statistical and data mining techniques. The instantiation part of the design science research involves an automated tool for the implementation of EHRAM and its application through a case study in a developing country.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">E-health</field><field name="subject">readiness</field><field name="subject">EHR</field><field name="subject">paper health records</field><field name="subject">design science</field><field name="subject">framework</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">Developing Countries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surrogate endpoints of survival in metastatic carcinoma</field><field name="creator">Nordman, Ina IC, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In most randomised controlled trials (RCTs), a large number of patients need to be followed over many years, for the clinical benefit of the drug to be accurately quantified (1). Using an early proxy, or a surrogate endpoint, in place of the direct endpoint of overall survival (OS) could theoretically shorten the duration of RCTs and minimise the exposure of patients to ineffective or toxic treatments (2, 3). This thesis examined the relationship between surrogate endpoints and OS in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). A review of the literature identified 144 RCTs in metastatic CRC, 189 in advanced NSCLC and 133 in MBC. The publications were generally of poor quality with incomplete reporting on many key variables, making comparisons between studies difficult. The introduction of the CONSORT statement was associated with improvements in the quality of reporting. For CRC (337 arms), NSCLC (429 arms) and MBC (290 arms) there were strong relationships between OS and progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), disease control rate (DCR), response rate (RR) and partial response (PR). Correlation was also demonstrated between OS and complete response (CR) in CRC and duration of response (DOR) in MBC. However, while strong relationships were found, the proportion of variance explained by the models was small. Prediction bands constructed to determine the surrogate threshold effect size indicated that large improvements in the surrogate endpoints were needed to predict overall survival gains. PFS and TTP showed the most promise as surrogates. The gain in PFS and TTP required to predict a significant gain in overall survival was between 1.2 and 7.0 months and 1.8 and 7.7 months respectively, depending on trial size and tumour type. DCR was a better potential predictor of OS than RR. The results of this study could be used to design future clinical trials with particular reference to the selection of surrogate endpoint and trial size.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metastatic cancer</field><field name="subject">surrogate endpoints</field><field name="subject">metastatic carcinoma</field><field name="subject">endpoints</field><field name="subject">survival</field><field name="subject">colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">lung cancer</field><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="subject">surrogate</field><field name="subject">non-small cell lung cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of mammalian lipid material by high performance liquid chromatography and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Proschogo, Nicholas William, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The analysis of the exact compositions of human lipids is of great importance and can lead to a better understanding of the role of lipids in heart diseases and diabetes.

A high proportion of immigrants in a society raises question about socioeconomic equality. The purpose of the thesis is to study the differences in socioeconomic attainments between immigrants and native-born workers.	Using data collected from the Issues in Multicultural Australia Survey, conducted in 1988, and the ABS Census of Population and Housing, 1986 and 1991, the study finds that human capital variables such as education, language proficiency and experience largely explain the socioeconomic attainments of Australian-born workers. Among immigrant workers, however, these human capital variables have little or no effect on status attainments. The data also show that the lower socioeconomic status of immigrants may not be due only to the lower investment in human capital. Even second generation NESB immigrants are unable to obtain comparable rewards compared to longer established Australians with similar education and skills. The study indicates that there may be barriers in the Australian labour market operating against NESB immigrants.	The study concludes that there are birthplace variations in workers??? socioeconomic attainments. When employers can hire Australian-born workers from a large pool of unemployed workers, immigrant workers will be excluded from employment. Immigrant workers will only be hired if the rewards for these workers are lower compared to Australian-born workers. In situations of high unemployment, especially, immigrant workers will find it difficult to be treated equally in the labour market.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian immigration</field><field name="subject">discrimination</field><field name="subject">earnings</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">equality</field><field name="subject">immigrant workers</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">human capital</field><field name="subject">labour force</field><field name="subject">labour market</field><field name="subject">migrant enclaves</field><field name="subject">migrants</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">non-English speaking background</field><field name="subject">NESB</field><field name="subject">socioeconomic attainments</field><field name="subject">status</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private lives : the presentation of marriage in English drama 1930-1990</field><field name="creator">Burns, Glenn, English, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the broadening of the subject matter of English drama in its ???new wave??? period from the late nineteen fifties, it is striking to see how much of enduring mainstream English drama has a domestic focus. The purpose of this thesis is to provide the first full-length study of marriage on the English stage from 1930-1990.  The thesis examines the way in which a number of important playwrights have fashioned drama from the conflict between the public, or institutional, functions of marriage and the private, or relational, functions of marriage. The thesis places this conflict into historical context. This will show that the conflict between the private and public aspects of marriage is not one of clearly opposed opposites but one that is made dynamic by significant social and legal changes to the status, function and conventions of marriage. The thesis also demonstrates that this conflict is further complicated by class considerations and by the particular circumstances of each marital partnership.  From the wealth of material available, I have chosen to examine in detail the work of seven playwrights who have made significant contributions to domestic drama or domestic comedy. Playwrights have been selected because their plays gained a strong audience on first performance and because, through numerous revivals and through publication of scripts, they have earned an enduring place in English drama. John Osborne???s Look Back in Anger, which in 1956, ushered in the ???new wave???, is pivotal play for discussion. The previous generation is represented by Noel Coward, J. B. Priestley and Terence Rattigan. The ???new wave??? and its aftermath are represented by Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard and, finally Alan Ayckbourn. Despite a wide variety of approaches to the topic of marriage, these writers tend to assume a middle class audience and to follow or adapt the traditions of realism or comedy of manners.  This thesis argues that despite real, even radical, changes to marriage, to accepted sexual practices and to the status of women in the sixty years under discussion, the mainstream theatre has tended to be conservative in its presentation of marital and sexual matters, especially in continuing to reinscribe a public/private opposition determined by gender.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public marriage</field><field name="subject">private  marriage</field><field name="subject">patriarchal marriage</field><field name="subject">Noel Coward</field><field name="subject">J.B.

With the recent availability of a wide range of binders and advanced construction equipment, the characterisation of cementitiously stabilised pavement materials has become the focus of further advancement of this technology. Australian practice has moved towards the use of Indirect Diametric Tensile (IDT) methods for the characterisation of these materials. A draft protocol for the IDT test has been prepared and specifies samples to be compacted by gyratory compactor. This procedure provides for both monotonic and repeated load testing, which aims to measure the material???s strength, modulus and fatigue life. A range of host materials, including a new crushed rock and a reclaimed existing pavement base course, were assessed when stabilised with a General Purpose cement binder as well as with a slag-lime blended binder. Materials were assess for their inherent material properties, Unconfined Compression Strength (UCS), Unconfined Compression modulus, IDT strength and modulus under both monotonic and repeated load. A number of amendments and refinements to the testing protocol were recommended. These included the use of minimum binder contents to ensure the binder was uniformly distributed and to promote heavy binding of the materials to ensure they behaved elastically. It was also recommended that samples be gyratory compacted to a pre-determined sample height to allow a constant density to be achieved. The variability of the test results was examined. UCS results were found to be comparatively as variable as other researchers had reported. IDT strength results contained a similar level of variability, which was considered to be acceptable. Modulus results, both monotonic and repeated load, were found to be five to ten times more variable than strength results, which is a generally accepted trend for modulus testing. Under repeated loading, some challenges with the test protocol were encountered. The primary challenge was obtaining reliable and repeatable diametrical displacement data for modulus calculation. This was partially overcome by the insertion of smooth spacers to prevent the Linear Voltage Displacement Transformer (LVDTs) becoming caught on the sample sides. The achievement of reliable and repeatable IDT modulus results through improved displacement measurements should be the focus of future research efforts in this area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cementitious stabilised pavement materials</field><field name="subject">monotonic strength</field><field name="subject">density</field><field name="subject">compaction</field><field name="subject">loading</field><field name="subject">maintenance and repair</field><field name="subject">cement composites</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provision of environmental goods on private land: a case study of Australian wetlands</field><field name="creator">Whitten, Stuart Max, Business, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The management of natural resources located on private lands often involves a perceived conflict between the mix of private and public benefit outputs they produce. Governments have tended to respond through legislation to restrict and redirect private decisions about resource management. However, the legislative response faces a lack of information about the costs and benefits of alternative management and policy instruments. A pertinent example of this debate is the management of wetlands on private lands.  The goal in this thesis is to advance the design of policy relating to the production of environmental outputs on private lands. This goal is achieved by first estimating the welfare impacts of alternative private land management strategies on the wider community. These estimates are used as inputs into the development of alternative policy instruments that are then evaluated in terms of their potential cost-effectiveness in influencing private management. Two case studies of wetland management on private land in Australia are presented ??? the Upper South East Region of South Australia, and, the Murrumbidgee River Floodplain in New South Wales.  The conceptual approach described in the first part of the thesis includes a description of the resource management problem and the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative decision frameworks widely employed in Australia. Identification of the cause and nature of transaction costs in the management process is the focus in this discussion.  The welfare impacts of alternative wetland management strategies are investigated through the construction of a bio-economic model for each of the case study areas. The approach integrates biophysical analysis of changing wetland management with the value society places on wetlands. Outputs from this process are used in the development of a range of policy instruments directed towards influencing wetland management. The impact of poorly quantified and uncertain transaction costs on the potential cost-effectiveness of these options is evaluated using threshold policy analysis.  The empirical results show that the perception of a conflict between the private and public values generated by resource management is accurate. For example, scenarios changing wetland management in the Upper South East of South Australia on the Murrumbidgee River floodplain in New South Wales were shown to generate net benefits of $5.2m and $5.1m respectively. Hence, changing wetland management could generate increased community welfare. The potential for these findings to be translated into wetland policy is less conclusive. Policies directed towards wetland management (in part or in whole) incur a range of transaction costs and deliver differential wetland protection benefits. Ten ???best bet??? policies are identified, but more information is required to determine conclusively whether a net benefit results to the wider community when transaction costs are included.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transaction costs</field><field name="subject">benefit-cost analysis</field><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">public goods</field><field name="subject">environmental economics</field><field name="subject">institutional economics</field><field name="subject">bio-economic modelling</field><field name="subject">policy selection</field><field name="subject">choice modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The eagle and the albatross : Australian aerial maritime operations 1921-1971</field><field name="creator">Wilson, David Joseph, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the relationship between the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) regarding the operation of aircraft from ships of the RAN and from RAAF shore bases.

The influence and effect on RAAF and RAN doctrine and equipment procurement, as a result of the special relationships that developed between the Air Force and Navy of Australia and Britain will be critically examined. A similar approach to the post war US/Australian relationship, and its effect on the Australian services, will also be critically examined. The thesis being propounded is that the development of a unique Australian maritime policy was retarded due to a combination of the relationship with Britain and the United States, lack of suitable equipment, lack of clear operational concepts in both the RAAF and RAN and the parochial attitude of the most senior commanders of both Services. 	The study has been based on Department of Navy, Department of Air and Department of Defence documents held in the National Archives of Australia in Canberra and Melbourne. In addition, relevant documents from the Admiralty and Air Ministry related to the development of naval aviation on RAN vessels during World War I, the attitude of the RAF toward the deployment of RAAF units to Singapore, and the negotiations that resulted in the procurement of HMA Ships Sydney and Melbourne, have been perused. Wartime operational records of the RAAF have been examined to obtain data to enable a critical study to be made of the RAAF anti-submarine campaign, torpedo bomber operations and the maritime campaign undertaken from bases in North Western Area during World War II. The influence of the commander of the United States 5th Air Force has also been incorporated in the discussion. The research uncovered procedural and operational variations between the two Services, the diversion of key elements from Australian command and the priority given to the American line of advance that resulted in Australian operations being given a secondary, supportive, status.	A conclusion reached as a result of this research has been that the development of a unique Australian maritime aerial capability was restricted by the requirement of Britain to deploy flying units to Singapore in 1940. Similarly, the pressure exerted on the RAN by the Admiralty to purchase the Light Fleet Carriers in the late 1940s was more in the interests of the RN and British foreign policy than that of the RAN. Overall, the relationship with the Britain and the United States masked the real weakness in Australia???s maritime operations and retarded its development.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerial maritime asset</field><field name="subject">aerial maritime operations</field><field name="subject">aerial maritime theory</field><field name="subject">aircraft</field><field name="subject">air power doctrine</field><field name="subject">anti-submarine operations</field><field name="subject">Australian maritime defence</field><field name="subject">Australian maritime policy</field><field name="subject">Australian naval aviation</field><field name="subject">Britain</field><field name="subject">British Far East policy</field><field name="subject">cold war effect on aerial maritime policy</field><field name="subject">Empire defence</field><field name="subject">equipment procurement</field><field name="subject">land based marine operations</field><field name="subject">maritime air power</field><field name="subject">maritime aerial operations</field><field name="subject">maritime doctrine</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">RAN</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Navy</field><field name="subject">Royal Navy Aviation policy</field><field name="subject">torpedo bomber squadrons</field><field name="subject">torpedo bomber strike</field><field name="subject">United States Naval Aviation</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Defence in transition: responding to new security challenges</field><field name="creator">Wing, Ian, Politics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conceptual understanding of security and the practicalities of national defence are interdependent.  In many countries both are undergoing significant change.  This work provides an international context but focuses on Australian defence, arguing that a transition is underway from old security thinking to new, and that this is evidenced by changes in policies and practical activities.  The aim of this work is to demonstrate the interdependence between the current reconceptualisation of security and the practicalities of national defence.  Old security thinking concerns military power relationships between states, in contrast with new security thinking, which uses a broader conceptual framework.  These are described, providing benchmarks for the subsequent analysis.  While it is acknowledged that change has occurred in security thinking throughout history, those developments observed since the end of the Cold War and the rise of globalisation signify a fundamental shift.    To explore this shift, recent developments in the defence policies and military activities of four relevant nations are examined, providing an international context for the consideration of the primary case study of Australian defence.  This case study draws on historical descriptions and empirical data to analyse developments in four spheres - Australian defence policy, current Australian Defence Force activities, recent military developments and contemporary Australian public debate.  The weight of evidence supports the thesis of a transition in both security thinking, described as transitional security thinking, and ADF activities.   Tensions are observed between the requirements of defending a nation against attack, and contributing to the expanding requirements of the broadened security agenda.    Despite these tensions, the expansion in both security thinking and the associated activities of armed forces, is likely to continue. This expansion has important implications for Australia???s defence capabilities which are increasingly required to meet the demands of refocused national security.  These demands contribute to the pressing challenges of convergence and overstretch.  A strategy of integration is recommended to address these challenges and it follows the principles of whole-of-government security and sustainable partnerships.  The application of these principles will require the ADF to emphasise capabilities with versatility and adaptability.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">national defence</field><field name="subject">defence policy</field><field name="subject">defence policies</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Force</field><field name="subject">transitional security thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">W3 Trust Model (W3TM): a trust-profiling framework to assess trust and transitivity of trust of web-based services in a heterogeneous web environment</field><field name="creator">Yang, Yinan, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The growth of eCommerce is being hampered by a lack of trust between providers and consumers of Web-based services. While Web trust issues have been addressed by researchers in many disciplines, a comprehensive approach has yet to be established. This thesis proposes a conceptual trust-profiling framework???W3TF???which addresses issues of trust and user confidence through a range of new user-centred trust measures???trust categories, trust domains, transitivity of trust, fading factor analysis, standalone assessment, hyperlinked assessment and relevance assessment. While others now use the concept of transitivity of trust, it was first introduced by this research in 1998. The thesis also illustrates how W3TF can narrow the gap/disconnection between the hierarchical PKI trust environment and the horizontal Web referral environment. The framework incorporates existing measures of trust (such as Public Key Infrastructure), takes account of consumer perceptions by identifying trust attributes, and utilises Web technology (in the form of metadata), to create a practical, flexible and comprehensive approach to trust assessment. The versatility of the W3TF is demonstrated by applying it to a variety of cases from trust literature and to the hypothetical case study that provided the initial stimulus for this research. It is shown that the framework can be expanded to accommodate new trust attributes, categories and domains, and that trust can be ???weighed??? (and therefore evaluated) by using various mathematical formulae based on different theories and policies. The W3TF addresses identified needs, narrows the gaps in existing approaches and provides a mechanism to embrace current and future efforts in trust management. The framework is a generic form of trust assessment that can help build user confidence in an eCommerce environment. For service providers, it offers an incentive to create websites with a high number of desired trust attributes. For consumers, it enables more reliable judgments to be made. Hence, Web trust can be enhanced.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer security</field><field name="subject">consumer confidence</field><field name="subject">eCommerce</field><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">electronic data interchange</field><field name="subject">metadata</field><field name="subject">online trust</field><field name="subject">online service providers</field><field name="subject">security measures</field><field name="subject">transitivity of trust</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">trust-profiling framework</field><field name="subject">trust relationship</field><field name="subject">web services</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping airfoils</field><field name="creator">Young, John, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is currently a great deal of interest within the aviation community in the design of small, slow-flying but manoeuvrable uninhabited vehicles for reconnaissance, surveillance, and search and rescue operations in urban environments. Inspired by observation of birds, insects, fish and cetaceans, flapping wings are being actively studied in the hope that they may provide greater propulsive efficiencies than propellers and rotors at low Reynolds numbers for such Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs). Researchers have posited the Strouhal number (combining flapping frequency, amplitude and forward speed) as the parameter controlling flapping wing aerodynamics in cruising flight, although there is conflicting evidence. This thesis explores the effect of flapping frequency and amplitude on forces and wake structures, as well as physical mechanisms leading to optimum propulsive efficiency. Two-dimensional rigid airfoils are considered at Reynolds number 2,000 ??? 40,000. A compressible Navier-Stokes simulation is combined with numerical and analytical potential flow techniques to isolate and evaluate the effect of viscosity, leading and trailing edge vortex separation, and wake vortex dynamics. The wake structures of a plunging airfoil are shown to be sensitive to the flapping frequency independent of the Strouhal number. For a given frequency, the wake of the airfoil exhibits ???vortex lock-in??? as the amplitude of motion is increased, in a manner analogous to an oscillating circular cylinder. This is caused by interaction between the flapping frequency and the ???bluff-body??? vortex shedding frequency apparent even for streamlined airfoils at low Reynolds number. The thrust and propulsive efficiency of a plunging airfoil are also shown to be sensitive to the flapping frequency independent of Strouhal number. This dependence is the result of vortex shedding from the leading edge, and an interaction between the flapping frequency and the time for vortex formation, separation and convection over the airfoil surface. The observed propulsive efficiency peak for a pitching and plunging airfoil is shown to be the result of leading edge vortex shedding at low flapping frequencies (low Strouhal numbers), and high power requirements at large flapping amplitudes (high Strouhal numbers). The efficiency peak is governed by flapping frequency and amplitude separately, rather than the Strouhal number directly.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">propulsion</field><field name="subject">propulsive</field><field name="subject">wake</field><field name="subject">thrust</field><field name="subject">drag</field><field name="subject">airfoil</field><field name="subject">motion</field><field name="subject">lift</field><field name="subject">turbulence modelling</field><field name="subject">plunging</field><field name="subject">Navier-Stokes</field><field name="subject">oscillating foils</field><field name="subject">Strouhal number</field><field name="subject">numbers</field><field name="subject">viscosity</field><field name="subject">leading edge</field><field name="subject">leading edges. trailing edge</field><field name="subject">vortex separation</field><field name="subject">flapping frequency</field><field name="subject">amplitude</field><field name="subject">wings</field><field name="subject">aerodynamic</field><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">viscous flow</field><field name="subject">simulation methods</field><field name="subject">aerofoils</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fracture analysis of glass microsphere filled epoxy resin syntactic foam</field><field name="creator">Young, Peter, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hollow glass microspheres have been used extensively in the automotive and marine industries as an additive for reducing weight and saving material costs. They are also added to paints and other materials for their reflective properties. They have shown promise for weight critical applications, but have thus far resulted in materials with low fracture toughness and impact resistance when combined with thermosetting resins in syntactic foam. The advent of commercially available microspheres with a wide range of crushing strengths, densities and adhesive properties has given new impetus to research into syntactic foam with better fracture behaviour. Current research suggests that the beneficial effects on fracture and impact resistance gained by the addition of solid reinforcements such as rubber and ceramic particles are not seen with the addition of hollow glass microspheres. The research presented in this paper has examined the mechanisms for fracture resistance in glass microsphere filled epoxy (GMFE) syntactic foams, as well as determined the effect microsphere crushing strength and adhesion strength has on the material???s fracture toughness. The flexural properties of various GMFE have also been determined. GMFE were manufactured with varying microsphere volume fraction up to 50%, and with variances in microsphere crushing strength and adhesion. The specimens were tested for Mode I fracture toughness in a three point single edge notched bending setup as described in ASTM D5045 as well as a three point flexural setup as described in ASTM D790-3. Fracture surfaces were inspected using scanning electron microscope imaging to identify the fracture mechanisms in the presence of microspheres. Results indicate a positive effect on fracture toughness resulting from new fracture areas created as tails in the wake of the microspheres in the fracture plane. Results also indicate a negative effect on fracture toughness resulting from weak microspheres or from interfacial disbonding at the fracture plane. These two effects combine to show an increase in GMFE fracture toughness as the volume fraction of microspheres is increased to between 10 ??? 20% volume fraction (where the positive effect dominates), with a reduction in fracture toughness as microspheres are added further (where the negative effect dominates).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fracture resistance</field><field name="subject">glass microspheres</field><field name="subject">syntactic foams</field><field name="subject">fracture toughness</field><field name="subject">flexural properties</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bewtween war and peace : the experience of occupation for members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, 1945-1952</field><field name="creator">Carter, Carolyne, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the British Commonwealth experience of occupation in Japan from 1945-1952. It draws on official and private records from the four participating British Commonwealth countries ??? Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand- to examine the complex relationship that developed between the occupying troops and the occupied Japanese population in the period between the cessation of hostilities and the formal ratification of a Peace Treaty. The thesis begins with an analysis of the preconceptions British Commonwealth troops brought with them to Japan, to establish the context for their cross-cultural encounter with Japan and the Japanese people. An understanding of the historical background enables the impressions formed by BCOF troops during the occupation to be presented not as random observations, but as part of a tradition of contact and cultural critique.  The British Commonwealth experience in Japan was shaped by a number of external factors. Delays in moving to Japan weakened media and public interest in the force, eroded morale and precipitated a ???foreign force??? mentality. Once in Japan, the dominant US presence, the subordinate status of BCOF and the shortcomings of the isolated, rural area allocated to the force were a source of disappointment and frustration. But the difficulties attending British Commonwealth involvement in the occupation should not obscure the simultaneous development of a significant cultural encounter. The circumstances of the occupation created a particular dynamic between BCOF troops and Japanese civilians. The responsibilities and obligations that SCAP conferred on the British Commonwealth force invested BCOF personnel with authority over the Japanese. The disparity in power was reinforced by participation in occupation tasks that confirmed their status as occupiers.  The occupation relationship was heavily influenced by the nature of personal interactions established between BCOF personnel and the Japanese people. Service in Japan provided opportunities for troops to reassess their views of the Japanese in the light of personal experience. For some, the cultural differences they observed only reinforced their sense of the ???otherness??? of the Japanese. For many others, the occupation provided a bridge between war and peace, as contact with Japanese people eased the intense hatreds generated during the war. For most British Commonwealth personnel, service with BCOF impacted in some way on the beliefs they held about Japan and the Japanese.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Britain</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural relationships</field><field name="subject">Occupiers</field><field name="subject">military control</field><field name="subject">policing</field><field name="subject">military occupation</field><field name="subject">occupation relations</field><field name="subject">demilitarising</field><field name="subject">Allied occupation 1942-1952</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PAP Singapore: a case study of stationary bandit in a market economy</field><field name="creator">Chan, Heng Kong, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the role of the state in Singapore???s political economy. The conventional methodology in the neoclassical economics tradition is essentially apolitical and is thus inadequate to appraise the inner working mechanism of the Singapore polity, given the pervasive influence of politics in policy decisions. This study therefore synthesizes a new analytical methodology, drawn from neo-institutionalism, to analyse the interrelations of state, market and social institutions in the Singapore of the People???s Action Party (PAP). Ronald Coase???s theorem of transaction costs, Steven Cheung???s economics of property rights and Douglass North???s theories of institutions and institutional change, collectively, provide a theoretical framework that allows this study to examine the intrinsic nature and characteristics of the Singapore polity.  Three major areas are investigated using this research paradigm. The first is the post-war political transition from colony to self-rule and the eventual emergence of an independent Singapore in the context of Cold War politics. The second is the process of social engineering through reconstitution, resettlement and socialization, a process that has aimed to alter the institutional environment that regulates the state and people and has tended to generate a submissive social ethos. The focus of the third is the redefining of property rights through nationalization, industrialisation, and privatisation that, in effect, has resulted in the extensive transfer of private wealth to the state.  Four case studies are offered to demonstrate the impact of politics in the making of economic policy, the general effect of which has been to eradicate entrepreneurs in favour of state-owned entities. The analysis concludes that Singapore is essentially to be characterised as a predatory state, and adopts Mancur Olson???s ???stationary bandit??? theory to reconcile the state???s predatory behaviour with Singapore???s record of positive economic development. The study identifies nine unique features that have characterised the Singapore polity, the single most important feature being the emergence of ???Lee???s Law??? which amounts to the paramount Singapore informal rule in regulating all aspect of social exchange. It is paramount because without reference to this rule the inner working mechanism of Singapore???s political economy cannot be explicated. But the predominance of PAP control imposes a heavy social cost as it risks Singapore???s long-term viability as a national state because of the likely emergence of distributional collusion and institutional sclerosis. Singapore???s long-term viability is therefore contingent upon the kind of political reformation that would reinstitute a low transaction cost mediation mechanism that would then facilitate incremental institutional change.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People's Action Party (Singapore)</field><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="subject">Propert</field><field name="subject">Social structure</field><field name="subject">Politics and government</field><field name="subject">Economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Social environment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An improved low-Reynolds-number k-E [ symbol -dissipation rate]</field><field name="creator">Chen, Suzhen, Aerospace &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here. Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.] Since the damping functions employed by most of the low-Reynolds-number models are related to the non-dimensional distance y+[ special character ??? near-wall non-dimensional distance in y direction], which is based on local wall shear stress, these models become invalid for separated flows, because the wall shear stress is zero at the reattachment point. In addition, the pressure-velocity correlation term is neglected in most of these models, although this term is shown in this thesis to be important in the near-wall region for simple flows and large pressure gradient flows. In this thesis, two main efforts are made to improve the k ??? [special character - dissipation rate] model. First, based on Myong and Kasagi???s (1990) low-Reynolds-number model (hereafter referred to as MK model), a more general damping function  [special character - turbulent viscosity damping function in LRN turbulent model] is postulated which only depends on the Reynolds numbers [formula ??? near-wall turbulence Reynolds number]. Second, a form for the pressure-velocity correlation term is postulated based on the Poisson equation for pressure fluctuations.  This modified model predicts the turbulent flow over a flat plate very well. It is found that the inclusion of the pressure-velocity correlation term leads to significant improvement of the prediction of near-wall turbulence kinetic energy. When the model is applied to turbulent flow over a backward-facing step, it produces better predictions than the traditional k ??? [special character - dissipation rate] model, FLUENT???s two-layer model and the MK model. Again, the pressure-velocity correlation term improves the turbulence kinetic energy prediction in the separated region over that of other models investigated here.  The studies of numerical methods concerning computational domain size and grid spacing reveal that a very large domain size is required for accurate flat plate flow computation. They also show that a fine grid distribution in the near-wall region upstream of the step is necessary for acceptable flow prediction accuracy in the downstream separated region.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Damping function</field><field name="subject">flat plate</field><field name="subject">flows</field><field name="subject">kinetic energy</field><field name="subject">near-wall</field><field name="subject">Reynolds number</field><field name="subject">turbulence</field><field name="subject">turbulent flow</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Spratly Islands dispute : decision units and domestic politics</field><field name="creator">Chung, Christopher, Humanities &amp; Social Science, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a cross-national, cross-regime examination of foreign policy decision-making in the Spratly Islands dispute, focusing on China, Malaysia and the Philippines. It argues that how and why these countries have acted in particular ways towards the dispute relates to the relationship among foreign policy decision-making, government behaviour and domestic politics.  The theoretical foundation of the study is foreign policy analysis. It applies the decision units approach advanced by Margaret and Charles Hermann and Joe Hagan to investigate who made foreign policy decisions on the Spratly Islands dispute in the three countries during the period 1991-2002, and how this influenced government behaviour. In addition, the contextual influence of domestic politics is considered. Four case studies inform the empirical analysis: the approaches taken by Malaysia and the Philippines to bolster their respective sovereignty claim, China???s establishment of a comprehensive maritime jurisdictional regime covering the Spratly Islands among other areas, China-Philippines contestation over Mischief Reef and the development of a regional instrument to regulate conduct in the South China Sea. 	Three conclusions are drawn. First, the decision units approach identifies the pivotal foreign policy decision-makers in each of the countries examined and the process involved. Second, it explains the relationship between decision unit characteristics -- self-contained or externally influenceable -- and each government???s behaviour towards the dispute. Injecting domestic politics into the analysis highlights motivations of and constraints faced by decision-makers, conditioning the form and content of government action. Third, it demonstrates a low predictive capability: the ???fit??? between hypothesised and actual government behaviour is poor.   While it is not a comprehensive analytical tool, the combined decision units-domestic politics approach offers deeper insight into government decisions and behaviour on the Spratly Islands dispute than hitherto reported in the literature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ASEAN</field><field name="subject">ASEAN Regional Forum</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Code of conduct</field><field name="subject">South China Sea</field><field name="subject">domestic politics</field><field name="subject">Erica Reef</field><field name="subject">Foreign policy decision-making</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">Investigator Shoal</field><field name="subject">law of the sea</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">maritime boundary disputes</field><field name="subject">maritime security</field><field name="subject">Mischief Reef</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">South China Sea</field><field name="subject">South East Asia</field><field name="subject">Spratly Islands</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marching to their own drum : British Army officers as military commandants in the Australian colonies and New Zealand 1870-1901</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Stephen John, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Between 1870 and 1901, seventeen officers from the British army were appointed by the governments of the Australian colonies and New Zealand as commanders of their colonial military forces. There has been considerable speculation about the roles of these officers as imperial agents, developing colonial forces as a wartime reserve to imperial forces, but little in depth research. This thesis examines the role of the imperial commandants with an embryonic system of imperial defence and their contribution to the development of the colonial military forces. It is therefore a topic in British imperial history as much as Australian and New Zealand military history.  British officers were appointed by colonial governments to overcome a shortfall in professional military expertise but increasingly came to be viewed by successive British administrations as a means of fulfilling an imperial defence agenda. The commandants as ???men-on-the-spot???, however, viewed themselves as independent reformers and got offside with both the imperial and colonial governments. This fact reveals that the commandants occupied a difficult position between the aspirations of London and the reality of the colonies. They certainly brought an imperial perspective to their commands and looked forward to the colonies playing a role on the imperial stage but generally did so in terms of a personal agenda rather than one set by London. This assessment is best demonstrated in the commandants??? independent stance at the outset of the South African War.  The practice of appointing British commandants in Australasia was fraught with problems because of an inherent conflict in the goals of the commandants and their colonial governments. It resembles the Canadian experience of the British officers which reveals that the system of imperials military appointments as a whole was flawed. The problem remained that until a sufficient number of colonial officers had the prerequisite professional expertise for high command there was no alternative. The commandants were therefore the beginning rather than the end of a traditional reliance upon British military expertise. The lasting legacy of the commandants for the military forces of Australia and New Zealand was the development of colonial officers, transference of British military traditions, and the encouragement of a colonial military identity premised on the expectation of future participation in defence of the empire. The study provides a major revision to the existing historiography of imperial officers in the colonies, one which concludes that far from being ???imperial agents??? they were largely marching to their own drum.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Australasia</field><field name="subject">British Army</field><field name="subject">commandants</field><field name="subject">colonial forces</field><field name="subject">colonies</field><field name="subject">defence</field><field name="subject">imperial</field><field name="subject">military</field><field name="subject">officers</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">South African War</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">1890s</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Canadian official historians and the writing of the world wars</field><field name="creator">Cook, Tim, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation analyses academic military history and the writing of the World Wars in Canada. While there have been hundreds of books devoted to Canada???s role in the World Wars, few historians have examined the writing of that same history, or the archival records that were used to construct these narratives.  It has been the official historians of the Department of National Defence who, for much of the twentieth century, have controlled the historical writing of the World Wars, and that military history has been narrowly defined as the history of military operations. Training, administrating and operational war-fighting remained the focus. Only recently have academic military historians pushed the discipline of military history to explore the impact of the World Wars on Canadian society. Nonetheless, it remains the publications of A.F. Duguid, C.P. Stacy, Gilbert Tucker, Fred Hitchins, Joseph Schull, and more recent official historians that provide the central narrative when examining the writing on Canada???s World Wars. An exploration of key historians and their works reveals historical themes underpinning how memory and narrative of the World Wars has been constructed within historical writing.  The official historians were the guardians of memory and controllers of the past. Caught within the battles of reputations that followed the World Wars, they were forced to carefully navigate through these contested issues. Laying an interpretative frame-work, the official historians allowed subsequent generations to build upon and rework their findings, through writing their histories but also by acting as the archivists for their respective services. While the official histories have their flaws, they are also exceptionally important foundational studies that deserve greater attention and study in their own right.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archive</field><field name="subject">archival</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">Canadian</field><field name="subject">historians</field><field name="subject">historical writing</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">military</field><field name="subject">official</field><field name="subject">war records</field><field name="subject">World Wars</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of electromagnetic force and noise in inverter driven induction motors</field><field name="creator">Astfalck, Allen, Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is part of a major research project to analyse vibro-acoustic characteristics from variable speed inverter driven induction motors (VSIDIM). The overall projects??? aimed at providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of sound generation from electromagnetic origins and developing a numerical model to predict the sound power emitted from a VSIDIM. The scope of this thesis is to assess experimentally the effect of various controller strategies on the radiated sound power and to develop a finite element method for calculating the electromagnetic force distribution over the stator.  Various sources of noise in induction motors and their behaviour with speed and load have been reviewed. Models of the electromagnetic field and vibro-acoustic character have been discussed. An outline of various techniques of reducing noise in induction motors through design of inverters and modifications to the motor structure has been given.  Experiments were conducted to assess the effect of controller strategies on the radiated sound power. Three different supplies were tested: a dynamotor which produces an almost sinusoidal supply with very low harmonic content, an inverter with a low switching frequency (less than 1kHz) and an inverter with a high switching frequency (8kHz) and various levels of random modulation. Results indicate that the sound power level of the MSC drive is a lot higher than that of the VSC 2000 drive and the dynamotor drive. The sound power level of the VSC 2000 drive and the dynamotor drive increases almost linearly with motor speed, that for the MSC drive is almost independent of speed. The sound power level of the MSC drive is almost 28dB higher than that of the dynamotor drive at 450rpm and the difference is reduced to 14dB at 1500rpm where the aerodynamic noise becomes more dominant. It has been found that at the rated speed (1500rpm), the sound power level varies by less than 3dB from no load to full load for all three sources.  Although increasing the switching frequency increases the cost of the inverters and switching losses, results from the MSC and VSC 2000 drives clearly show that it reduces the radiated sound power by shifting the harmonics into higher and inaudible frequency range. The tonal nature around the switching frequency has been reduced by increasing the levels of random modulation to spread the energy over a wider range of frequencies, although the sound power level has not varied by more than 0.2dB.  A finite element model has been developed to calculate the electromagnetic force distribution. The quasi-static solution method has been implemented by stepping the rotor through the time domain using a fine regular mesh in the air gap. The stator currents were experimentally obtained while the rotor currents were obtained using a 4 parameter state space model of the motor. Results of the simulation indicate the influence of stator and rotor slots, saturation and time harmonics in the current. The calculated electromagnetic force distribution has been used in a FEM/BEM acoustic model and SEA acoustic model to predict the radiated sound power which agrees reasonably well with the measured sound, thus validating indirectly the electromagnetic force simulations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Induction motor</field><field name="subject">inverter</field><field name="subject">acoustic</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">finite element modelling</field><field name="subject">Maxwell force distribution</field><field name="subject">vibro-acoustic</field><field name="subject">radiated sound power</field><field name="subject">dynamotor drive</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic force distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of swept and unswept normal shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction and control by piezoelectric flap actuation</field><field name="creator">Couldrick, Jonathan Stuart, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The interaction of a shock wave with a boundary layer is a classic viscous/inviscid interaction problem that occurs over a wide range of high speed aerodynamic flows. For example, on transonic wings, in supersonic air intakes, in propelling nozzles at offdesign conditions and on deflected controls at supersonic/transonic speeds, to name a few. The transonic interaction takes place at Mach numbers typically between 1.1 and 1.5. On an aerofoil, its existence can cause problems that range from a mild increase in section drag to flow separation and buffeting. In the absence of separation the drag increase is predominantly due to wave drag, caused by a rise in entropy through the interaction.  The control of the turbulent interaction as applied to a transonic aerofoil is addressed in this thesis. However, the work can equally be applied to the control of interaction for numerous other occurrences where a shock meets a turbulent boundary layer. It is assumed that, for both swept normal shock and unswept normal shock interactions, as long as the Mach number normal to the shock is the same, then the interaction, and therefore its control, should be the same.  Numerous schemes have been suggested to control such interaction. However, they have generally been marred by the drag reduction obtained being negated by the additional drag due to the power requirements, for example the pumping power in the case of mass transfer and the drag of the devices in the case of vortex generators. A system of piezoelectrically controlled flaps is presented for the control of the interaction. The flaps would aeroelastically deflect due to the pressure difference created by the pressure rise across the shock and by piezoelectrically induced strains. The amount of deflection, and hence the mass flow through the plenum chamber, would control the interaction. It is proposed that the flaps will delay separation of the boundary layer whilst reducing wave drag and overcome the disadvantages of previous control methods. Active control can be utilised to optimise the effects of the boundary layer shock wave interaction as it would allow the ability to control the position of the control region around the original shock position, mass transfer rate and distribution.  A number of design options were considered for the integration of the piezoelectric ceramic into the flap structure. These included the use of unimorphs, bimorphs and polymorphs, with the latter capable of being directly employed as the flap. Unimorphs, with an aluminium substrate, produce less deflection than bimorphs and multimorphs. However, they can withstand and overcome the pressure loads associated with SBLI control.  For the current experiments, it was found that near optimal control of the swept and unswept shock wave boundary layer interactions was attained with flap deflections between 1mm and 3mm. However, to obtain the deflection required for optimal performance in a full scale situation, a more powerful piezoelectric actuator material is required than currently available.  A theoretical model is developed to predict the effect of unimorph flap deflection on the displacement thickness growth angles, the leading shock angle and the triple point height. It is shown that optimal deflection for SBLI control is a trade-off between reducing the total pressure losses, which is implied with increasing the triple point height, and minimising the frictional losses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock wave</field><field name="subject">boundary layer</field><field name="subject">viscous/inviscid interaction</field><field name="subject">transonic aerofoil</field><field name="subject">drag (aerodynamics)</field><field name="subject">flaps</field><field name="subject">piezoelectric</field><field name="subject">flap actuators</field><field name="subject">unimorphs</field><field name="subject">bimorphs</field><field name="subject">polymorphs</field><field name="subject">deflection</field><field name="subject">swept shock wave</field><field name="subject">turbulence</field><field name="subject">pressure sensitive paints</field><field name="subject">shock waves</field><field name="subject">piezoelectricity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Track made good : a history of air navigation in the Royal Australian Air Force and its predecessor, the Australian Flying Corps ??? 1914 to 1945</field><field name="creator">Coyle, Tim, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Between 1914 and 1945 the Australian air services, the Australian Flying Corps (AFC ??? 1914 to 1919), the Australian Air Corps (AAC ??? 1920 to 1921) and their successor, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF ??? 1921 to 1945), developed from a marginally effective air arm into a major air force with a continental strike capability.  The interwar period saw a series of pioneering flights which not only laid the foundations for the air defence of Australia but also assisted in national development.  Essential to the development of the AFC and the RAAF was the practice of air navigation.  While much has been written on World War II RAAF operations, almost nothing has been published on the policy, training and practice of air navigation in support of wartime operations or the interwar period.  This omission is addressed by the examination of air navigation in the AFC and the RAAF from the rudiments of World War I to the emergence of air navigation as a critical specialist function which culminated in its practice in World War II tactical and strategic air operations.  It was the wartime development of Australian air power between 1939 and 1945, and the parallel practice of advanced navigation techniques, that underscored Australia???s contribution to the allied air offensive.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">World War</field><field name="subject">1914-1918</field><field name="subject">World War</field><field name="subject">1939-1945</field><field name="subject">aerial operations</field><field name="subject">navigation</field><field name="subject">navigators</field><field name="subject">aeronautics</field><field name="subject">Australian Flying Corps</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short wave infrared spectral response of fluvial channel sands in the Towamba River, NSW, Australia :  implications for sediment tracing</field><field name="creator">Crowell, Kelly Jean, Geography &amp; Oceanography, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Emergent spatial signals which may be interpreted in the context of fluvial sediment transport processes are detected through the use of reflectance spectroscopy in the sand-sized sediments of the Towamba River, southeastern New South Wales.  Reflectance spectroscopy of sufficiently fine spectral resolution represents a technique for mineral composition analysis which is complementary to X-ray diffraction, with advantages in terms of ease of sample preparation and rapidity of measurement. Instrumentation is available allowing high-quality spectrum acquisition in the field and from airborne and satellite-borne instruments. The former allows mineral analyses to more easily be incorporated into sediment tracing studies as an additional variable. The latter offers large scale, repeatable areal coverage of a dynamic system in which sediments are exposed to the sky.  The Towamba River drains a catchment of c. 1000 km [square] in extensively altered granitic terrain along the south coast of New South Wales, and carries significant quantities of sand-sized sediment through much of the system. Pervasive but spatially variable chlorite, epidote, and sericite have been described in local and neighbouring terrain. These are spectrally active in the SWIR wavelength region in which the PIMA portable spectrometer operates. The airborne HyMap instrument is sensitive through this range as well as through the visible and near-infrared regions. Conventionally such channel sediments would represent a single class in the context of the broader landscape, and comparatively they represent a domain of restricted variance.  In this study of samples of sediment were collected for analysis with the PIMA, the results of which supported the efficacy of such an exercise in a conventional tracing context and supported analysis of HyMap imagery. Although issues related to reduction of HyMap-detected radiance to reflectance prevented effective analysis of the shorter wavelengths sensitive to the presence of ferrous and ferric iron, the consideration of absorption feature depths and the application of a matched filtering operator revealed gross-scale spatial patterns which were interpreted as two populations of sand in the main channel. This interpretation is consistent with bank erosion occurring during two very large magnitude flow events in the 1970s, with minor ongoing perturbation of the sediment signal in the main channel by the contribution of sediment from tributaries.  The presence of a definite spatial signal having been established, routes for further investigation are suggested. A noisy signal hypothesised on the basis of imagery may be used to better direct a field sampling program for a conventional sediment tracing study. The signal to noise ratio may be improved for example through calibration of radiance to reflectance and removal of atmospheric interference and improved field sampling schemes, after which more rigorous, quantitative exercises such as geostatistical ???field??? trial or spatial series analysis may be performed. Connections to process through sediment transport models are enabled through the use of GIS.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reflectance spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">sediment transport</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Towamba River.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">While freedom lives : political preoccupations in the writing of Marjorie Barnard and Frank Dalby Davison, 1935-1947</field><field name="creator">Darby, Robert, English, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem with which this thesis is concerned is the relationship between literature and politics. By means of a biographical and historical study two significant writers of the 1930s/40s I examine the ways in which the pressures of Depression, the threat of fascism and the onset of war influenced Australian writing. In particular, I ask whether the political issues of the period affected what these authors wrote and how they wrote it.  My conclusion is that pressure of political concern caused significant personal, philosophical and political changes in Barnard and Davison, and that it affected both the genre in which they wrote and the content of their fiction. They turned from fiction to cultural commentary, historical writing, political pamphleteering and activism. They utilised short fiction as a means of discussing their worries about the state of the world and in order to promote values they felt threatened. When they returned to longer fiction their work bore, to differing degrees, in its ideas, arguments and imagery, the influence of their political engagement.  More generally, I conclude that liberal humanism was the major animating philosophy of writers in the 1930s and that their concern with political issues grew from their conviction that western liberal democracy was the most fruitful soil for the production of art, a climate of freedom which they felt threatened by both fascism and war. This anxiety is the most important factor in both their politicisation and the work they did under the latter???s influence.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">Frank Dalby Davison</field><field name="subject">Marjorie Barnard</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">social protest</field><field name="subject">censorship</field><field name="subject">war</field><field name="subject">civil liberties</field><field name="subject">novels</field><field name="subject">short stories</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Redefinition of Asia : Australian Foreign Policy and Contemporary Asian Regionalism</field><field name="creator">de Somer, Gregory John, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to ascertain the position of recent Australian Governments on the latest instalments of Asian regionalism in the context of an assessment of whether there has been a redefinition of Asia and thus a redefinition of Australia???s engagement with Asia. It will concentrate on the broad themes of politico-strategic and economic engagement. Whilst there has been extensive research and documentation on the Asian economic crisis there has been less work on the issue of a new Asian regionalism and the implications for Australia???s complex and variable engagement with the region. This is the basis for the claim to originality of this thesis, a claim supported by its focus on the practical and policy implications of Australia???s engagement, or lack of it, with regional institutions.  The process of regional integration has been extremely slow, thus supporting the conclusion that there is no evidence of a major redefinition of Asia. Efforts at Asian regionalism are meeting obstacles that pose immense challenges. Asian regionalism remains nascent and poorly defined. This reflects the diversity and enormous disparities in cultures, political systems and the levels of economic development and differences over economic philosophies within East Asia.  What is discernible is that the regionalism is proceeding more rapidly on financial issues than on trade, and in the security area it is conspicuously absent.  This research highlights the fact that the question of Asian engagement remains a sensitive issue in Australia and continues to grow more complex. Australia???s engagement with Asia since 1996 has been variable because of the Howard Government???s broader balance of priorities between global and regional issues, and because of the changing nature of the Asian region. The perception gleaned from sources is that, for the Australian Government, regionalism initiatives are characterised by much discussion but lack substance.  Consequently, this appears to have led the Government to the position that exclusion from some manifestations of regionalism is not so important. Australia is excluded from some of the regional architectures being constructed. In its efforts to seek inclusion in ASEAN + 3 and ASEM, Australia is facing the same barriers that have stood in the way of an AFTA-CER agreement. Exclusion would be important if the performance of regional groupings was not so indifferent. Exclusion from ASEAN + 3 and ASEM, however, does not equate to Australia???s exclusion from the region.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AEM</field><field name="subject">AFTA</field><field name="subject">AFTA-CER</field><field name="subject">ASEAN plus China Japan ROK</field><field name="subject">ASEM</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Asian economic crisis</field><field name="subject">Asia-Europe Meeting</field><field name="subject">ASEAN Free Trade Area</field><field name="subject">ASEAN Free Trade Area (Australia-New Zealand) Closer Economic Relations Agreement</field><field name="subject">Asia region</field><field name="subject">Asian regionalism</field><field name="subject">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian defence debate</field><field name="subject">Australian foreign policy</field><field name="subject">Australian foreign relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of automated radar systems for monitoring and characterising echoes from insect targets</field><field name="creator">Dean, Timothy J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the construction of a mobile Insect Monitoring Radars (IMR) and investigations of: the reliability of IMRs for observing insect migration in inland Australia; possible biases in IMR migration estimates; the relation between an insect???s size and its radar properties; radar discrimination between insect species; the effect of weather on the migrations of Australian plague locusts and of moths; the scale of these migrations; and here IMRs are best located. The principles of entomological radar design, and the main features of insect migration in inland Australia, are reviewed. The main procedures used in the study are: calculation of radar performance and of insect radar cross sections (RCSs); reanalysis of a laboratory RCS dataset; statistical analysis of a fouryear dataset of IMR and weather observations; and a field campaign using both two existing fixed IMRs and the new mobile unit. Statistical techniques used include correlation, multiple regression, discriminant analysis, and principal components analysis. The original results of this work include design details of the mobile IMR, extension of radar performance calculations to IMRs and evaluation of flight speed biases, a holistic approach to IMR design, the relation of insect RCS magnitudes and polarization patterns to morphological variables, an estimate of the accuracy of the retrieved parameters, evaluations of three approaches (oneparameter, theory-based, and a novel two-stage method) to target identification, and verification of inferred target identities using results from nearby light traps. Possible sites for future IMRs are identified. The major conclusions are that: a mobile IMR can be built with a performance equal to that of a fixed IMR but at half the cost; significant biases in the signal processing results arise from insect speed; locusts and moths can be distinguished if all RCS parameters are used; IMRs can be designed to match particular requirements; weather has a significant effect on insect migration, the best single predictor of insect numbers being temperature; moonlight has no effect; the spatial correlation of migration properties falls to 50% at a separation of 300 km; and migrating insects can be carried by the wind for 500 km in a single night</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile insect monitoring radars (IMR)</field><field name="subject">insect migration</field><field name="subject">entomological radar design</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">weather</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">environmental factors</field><field name="subject">spring moth</field><field name="subject">plague locust</field><field name="subject">radar</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic characterisation of vibration isolators</field><field name="creator">Dickens, John D., Aerospace &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A vibration isolator is designed to reduce the vibration and structure borne noise transmitted from a vibratory source, such as machinery and equipment, to the supporting structure. The vibration and structure borne noise transmitted depends upon the dynamic properties of the foundation, the source mounting point and the vibration isolator. Therefore knowledge of the frequency dependent dynamic properties of vibration isolators is a necessary part of the acoustic prediction and control/reduction process.  Vibration isolators may be characterised by measuring their four-pole parameters. A measurement procedure is proposed that employs the floating mass method, measures the direct forces and corrects for the errors introduced by the direct force measurement. Compared to the basic method, it extends the frequency limits of measurement in both directions.  The development of a novel vibration isolator test facility that implements the proposed measurement procedure is described, and its satisfactory operation is experimentally demonstrated. The vibration isolator test facility is capable of characterizing vibration isolators commonly used in industrial and maritime applications, under service conditions.  A method is proposed for measuring the four-pole parameters of a uni-directional asymmetrical vibration isolator under static load. The method is called the two masses method, and is suitable for determining the four???pole parameters of active vibration isolators with feedback control. The method is also applicable to uni-directional symmetrical and bi-directional symmetrical and bi-directional asymmetrical vibration isolators. It may be regarded as a universal method for characterising vibration isolators. Experimental data is presented and the method is validated.  Modelling of vibration isolators is complicated by the highly non-linear nature of their rubber elements. The notion of an effective rubber cylinder is proposed to account for the barrelling of rubber elements under static load. Consequently, a general static compression model is proposed that applies to vibration isolators having unfilled and filled rubber elements of regular prismatic shapes. The model predicts the dependence of the four-pole parameters on the compression ratio of the rubber element. The predictions derived from the effective rubber cylinder and general static compression model agree excellently with experimental work of this study and other researchers.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration isolator</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">structure borne noise</field><field name="subject">four-pole parameters</field><field name="subject">floating mass method</field><field name="subject">uni-directional asymmetrical vibration isolator</field><field name="subject">two masses method</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The provocation of Saul Bellow : perfectionism and travel in The adventures of Augie March and Herzog</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Adam, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A consistent feature of Saul Bellow???s fiction is the protagonist???s encounter with one or more teaching figures. Dialogue with such individuals prompts the Bellovian protagonist to reject his current state of selfhood as inadequate and provokes him to re-form as a new person. The teacher figure offers a better self to which the protagonist is attracted; or, more frequently in Bellow, the protagonist is repelled by both his teacher and his own current state to form a new, previously unrepresented self. This thesis argues that Bellow???s self inherits and modifies the perfectionist philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, in a literary reinterpretation that parallels Stanley Cavell???s philosophical revaluation of the American Transcendentalists. In Emerson and Thoreau, and in Cavell???s reading of perfectionism, the self is attracted onward only by a better representation of selfhood in another, while Bellow???s self may also be, and often is, provoked by a repellent other to inhabit a new form of selfhood. This thesis takes the evolution of selfhood in Bellow to be structured by travel. In The Adventures of Augie March, Augie???s movement between selves is impelled by conversation with teacher figures and paralleled by his unending journeys. In Herzog, Herzog???s self-transformations and travels are provoked by reading and writing, and by the ecstasy of loss revealed to him through apostrophic conversations with the dead and absent in a series of unsent and mental letters. Letter-writing, the provocation for Herzog???s self-perfection, becomes a form of travel in Herzog. This thesis further argues that Bellow???s travelling self is a critical response to two poles of modern subjectivity, structured by European mythologies of travel: Bellow???s fiction is critical, first, of a Hegelian, egoist mode of selfhood structured after the Odyssey; but equally critical of examples of Levinasian openness to the Other, patterned on Abraham???s exile. Bellow does not accept either the Odyssean or the Abrahamic mode of selfhood on its own, recognizing oppressive possibilities in both. Travelling selfhood in Bellow, initiated by conversation with others, both fuses and rereads Odyssean and Abrahamic constructs within a new, but perpetually unfinished American mode of selfperfection.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saul Bellow</field><field name="subject">Adventures of Augie March</field><field name="subject">selfhood</field><field name="subject">Herzog</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">selfperfection</field><field name="subject">American fiction</field><field name="subject">modernism</field><field name="subject">influence</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">travels</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diverse organisation : operational considerations for managing organisational information resources</field><field name="creator">Dowse, Andrew, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sharing and exploitation of information resources across a diverse organisation can confer a significant competitive advantage but also can be a substantial challenge in coordinating across structural and specialisation boundaries. This challenge reflects the difficulties traditionally associated with lateral relations, which were recognised by classical organisational theorists but are more pronounced with the emergence of information as a critical resource. Notwithstanding the benefits of information sharing across the organisation, the classical concept of specialisation remains fundamental to organisational theory; thus there is potential for friction between requirements for specialisation and coordination. This research therefore examines information management arrangements to balance specialisation and coordination in a diverse organisation.  The research takes advantage of organisational and systems theory literature to appreciate complex information management requirements in terms of differentiation/cohesion and integration/coupling of organisational elements. Information management???s business and technology perspectives define the conceptual framework, within which gaps in the literature are identified and become the focus of the research. The two key research areas are the opportunities enabled by technology for business integration through collaborative decision-making and the management of organisation-wide information technology infrastructure. Collaborative decision-making is an integrating mechanism that can provide balance between specialisation and coordination contingent upon the nature of decision tasks and their organisational context. Propositions associated with an adaptive approach to collaborative decision-making were tested in laboratory experiments, with positive support for the contingency model albeit constrained by individual cognitive variances.  Organisations increasingly are adopting centralised approaches to the provision of IT services, with IT governance as an integrating mechanism and a need for multiple business-IT alignments to add value according to the differentiation required by organisational elements. Propositions relating to the adaptation of IT management arrangements based upon organisational characteristics were tested using a multi- iv -discipline approach, which resulted in support for the model although practical difficulties were experienced in the action research component.  This research provides a framework for maintaining effective variety of information capabilities commensurate with the diverse organisation???s mission and environment, while also exploiting the synergies and economies of shared information resources for holistic benefits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">information technology management</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">collaborative decision making</field><field name="subject">ommunication</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early developments in the literature of Australian natural history : together with a select bibliography of Australian natural history writing, printed in English, from 1697 to the present</field><field name="creator">Drayson, Nick, English, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Early nineteenth-century Eurocentric perceptions of natural history led to the flora and fauna of Australia being thought of as deficient and inferior compared with those of other lands. By the 1820s, Australia had become known as ???the land of contrarieties???. This, and Eurocentric attitudes to nature in general, influenced the expectations and perceptions of immigrants throughout the century. Yet at the same time there was developing an aesthetic appreciation of the natural history of Australia. This thesis examines the tension between these two perceptions in the popular natural history writing of the nineteenth century, mainly through the  writing of five authors ??? George Bennett (1804-1893), Louisa Anne Meredith (1812-1895), Samuel Hannaford (1937-1874), Horace Wheelwright (1815-1865) and Donald Macdonald (1859?-1932). George Bennett was a scientist, who saw Australian plants and animals more as scientific specimens than objects of beauty. Louisa Meredith perceived them in the familiar language of English romantic poetry. Samuel Hannaford used another language, that of popular British natural history writers of the mid-nineteenth century. To Horace Wheelwright, Australian animals were equally valuable to the sportsman???s gun as to the naturalist???s pen. Donald Macdonald was the only one of these major writers to have been born in Australia. Although proud of his British heritage, he rejoiced in the beauty of his native land. His writing demonstrates his joy, and his novel attitude to Australian natural history continued and developed in the present century.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meredith</field><field name="subject">Louisa Anne</field><field name="subject">Hannaford</field><field name="subject">Samuel</field><field name="subject">Wheelwright</field><field name="subject">Horace William</field><field name="subject">Macdonald</field><field name="subject">Donald</field><field name="subject">natural history literature</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">fauna</field><field name="subject">flora</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raicakacaka : 'walking the road' from colonial to post-colonial mission : the life, work and thought of the Reverend Dr. Alan Richard Tippett, Methodist missionary in Fiji, anthropologist and missiologist, 1911-1988</field><field name="creator">Dundon, Colin George, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the literature on the history of the transition from colonial to post-colonial in the Pacific. It explores the contribution of an individual to this transition, Rev. Dr. Alan Richard Tippett, as a focus for illuminating the struggles in the transitions and the development of post-colonial theory for mission.  Alan Richard Tippet sailed to Fiji as an ordained Methodist missionary in 1941. He was a product of a Methodist parsonage and heir to the evangelical and revival tendencies of the Cornish Methodism of his family. He began his missionary career steeped in the colonial visions of the mission enterprise fostered by the Board of Missions of his church. He was eager to study anthropology but was given no chance to do so before he left Australia.  He pursued his study of anthropology and history in Fiji and began to question the paternalism of colonial theory. Early in his time in Fiji he made the decision to join with those who sought change and the death of colonial mission. In his work as a circuit minister, theological educator, writer and administrator he worked to this end. He developed his talent for writing and research, encouraging the Fijian church to take pride in its past achievements. He became alienated from the administrators of the Australasian Methodist Board of Missions and could find no place in the Australian church.  In 1961 he left Fiji and began a course of study at the newly formed Institute of Church Growth in Eugene, Oregon. This led him into the orbit of Donald McGavran and the newly emerging church growth theory of Christian mission. Although his desire was to enhance the study of post-colonial mission in Australia he could not find a position to support him even after he gained a PhD in anthropology from the University of Oregon. After research in the Solomon Islands he returned to the USA to assist Donald McGavran in the formation of the now famous School of World Mission at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena.  While at Fuller he exercised considerable influence in the development of missiological theory and especially the application of anthropological studies in post-colonial mission. Although he contributed to both the ecumenical and evangelical debates on mission, he found himself caught up in the bitter debates of the 1960s and 1970s between them and, despite all efforts to maintain links, lost contact with the ecumenical wing.  Retiring to Australia in 1977 he found that his world reputation was not recognised in his native land. He continued his work apace, although he was deeply saddened by the ignorance he found in Australia and by his continued rejection. He finally donated his library to St. Mark???s National Theological Centre. He died in 1988 in Canberra.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alan Richard Tippett</field><field name="subject">anthropology</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">Christian</field><field name="subject">colonial</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">Donald McGavran</field><field name="subject">ecumenical</field><field name="subject">ethnohistory</field><field name="subject">evangelical</field><field name="subject">faith</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Fijian</field><field name="subject">Fuller Theological Seminary</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Institute of Church Growth</field><field name="subject">Methodism</field><field name="subject">Methodist Church</field><field name="subject">ministry</field><field name="subject">missiologist</field><field name="subject">mission</field><field name="subject">missions</field><field name="subject">missionary</field><field name="subject">post-colonial</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">School of World Mission</field><field name="subject">Suva</field><field name="subject">theologians</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multi-coloured universe of 2S 0114+650</field><field name="creator">Farrell, Sean Adam, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the high mass X-ray binary 2S 0114+650. This enigmatic source has previously been proposed to be the first in a new class of super-slow X-ray pulsars, containing a neutron star revolving once every 2.7 h. The 11.6 d orbital period of this system has been well established in both X-ray and optical wavelengths. During the initial stages of the research presented in this thesis we discovered an additional 30.7 d ???super-orbital??? modulation in the X-ray emission from this source. While similar periodicities seen in other X-ray binaries are commonly attributed to the precession of a warped accretion disc, the observational evidence suggests the absence of such a disc in 2S 0114+650. The purpose of this project is thus to determine the nature of the super-orbital modulation and to better constrain the astrophysical parameters of this system.    To investigate the long-term variability we analysed ~8.5 yr of archived data from  the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer space telescope. The problem of the spurious ~24 h periods in this data was solved as a by-product of these studies. Follow-up pointed observations were obtained with this satellite in order to examine the spectral and temporal behaviour over the spin, orbital and super-orbital timescales. Independent confirmation of the super-orbital modulation was performed using ~2 yr of data from the INTEGRAL satellite obtained during a long-term monitoring campaign of the Cassiopeia region. The evolution of the spin, orbital and super-orbital periods over ~10 yr was examined using archived data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. Radio observations were performed with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope to search for any radio emission associated with this source and to determine whether it is variable over the known periodicities. Near infrared observations were performed with the Mt Abu telescope to determine whether a Be star nature can be ruled out for the optical component. Finally, a statistical analysis of the properties of the confirmed super-orbital X-ray binaries was performed in order to search for commonalities between these systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">X-ray astronomy</field><field name="subject">X-ray binaries</field><field name="subject">pulsars</field><field name="subject">Rossi x-ray timing explorer</field><field name="subject">spectral leakage</field><field name="subject">RXTE PCA &amp; HEXTE observations</field><field name="subject">2S 0114+650</field><field name="subject">near infrared observations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualisation techniques for the computer simulation of bushfires in two dimensions</field><field name="creator">French, Ian, Dept. of Computer Science, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines techniques that provide a method of computer visualisation of bushfire spread. Existing techniques studied include, Kourtz &amp; O???Regan, Green???s Contact, Heat Accumulation, Percolation modelling and Huygens??? Principle by Anderson et.al., French, Roberts, Richards. Many of these techniques are extended as part of a comprehensive study into how they perform in a two dimensional reference frame (ie over flat terrain only). New techniques are defined for Percolation Modelling and Huygens??? Principle.  Each technique is examined in a series of test cases which include computer simulations with no wind, constant wind, variable wind, variable vegetation (including patchy fuel and two fuels) and where fuel burns out. These test cases provide: (a) an incremental approach to understanding the operation of each technique; (b) a basis for comparison; and (c) verification of correctness of the technique in two dimensions.  Several of the techniques are shown, by these test cases, to be equivalent. For instance, the Kourtz &amp; O???Regan technique using a square template is equivalent to the Contact Technique, Site percolation is similar to the Heat Accumulation technique and Template percolation is similar to the Contact Technique. Overall the Huygens???

Contemporary environmentalism and Aboriginal land rights have both challenged the status of pastoralists as valued primary producers and bearers of a worthy pioneer heritage. Instead, pastoralists have become associated with land degradation, biodiversity loss, and Aboriginal dispossession. Such pressure has intensified in the 1990s in the wake of the native Title debate, and various conservation campaigns in the arid and semi-arid rangelands.  The pressure on pastoralists occur in the context of wider reassessment of the social and economic values or rangelands in which pastoralism is seen as having declined in value compared to ???post-production??? land uses. Reassessments of rangelands in turn are part of the global changes in the status of rural areas, and of the growing flexibility in the very meaning of ???rural???.  Through ethnographic fieldwork among largely non-indigenous pastoralists in Central Australia, this thesis investigates the nature and foundations of pastoralists??? responses to these changes and critiques. Through memory, history, labour and experience of land, non-indigenous pastoralists construct a narrative of land, themselves and others in which the presence of pastoralism in Central Australia is naturalised, and Central Australia is narrated as an inherently pastoral landscape. Particular types of environmental knowledge and experience, based in actual environmental events and processes form the foundation for a discourse of pastoral property rights. Pastoralists accommodate environmental concerns, through advocating environmental stewardship. They do this in such a way that Central Australia is maintained as a singularly pastoral landscape, and one in which a European, or ???white???, frame of reference continues to dominate. In this way the domesticated pastoral landscapes of colonialism and nationalism are reproduced.  The thesis also examines Aboriginal pastoralism as a distinctive form of pastoralism, which fulfils distinctly Aboriginal land use and cultural aspirations, and undermines the conventional meaning of ???pastoralism??? itself.  The thesis ends by suggesting that improved dialogue over rangelands futures depends on greater understanding of the details and complexities of local relationships between groups of people, and between people and land.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal land rights</field><field name="subject">pastoralists</field><field name="subject">pastoralism</field><field name="subject">pastoral settlement</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">Central Australia</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">environmentalism</field><field name="subject">mythic landscapes</field><field name="subject">cultural politics</field><field name="subject">colonialism</field><field name="subject">soil conservation</field><field name="subject">non-indigenous</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">landcare</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">outback</field><field name="subject">variability</field><field name="subject">rangelands</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersion of two dimensional coflowing jet in the intermediate field</field><field name="creator">Guo, Hong Wei, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">An analytical dispersion model has been derived to determine the distribution of velocities and concentrations of a tracer in a two-dimensional jet in a coflowing ambient fluid. The particular novelty of this model is that it bridges the gap between near-field (where initial momentum dominates behaviour) and far-field (where ambient turbulence is more important) domains. We describe this domain as the ???intermediate field???. In a literature review of coflowing jets we find several laboratory studies and models which can predict the velocities (and in some cases concentrations) in a 2D jet, however they all have shortcomings. None could fully account for ambient turbulence, and all were strictly near-field, i.e. they are unable to describe behaviour when ambient turbulence dominates the initial shear. A brief review of analytical far-field models was also undertaken. There are standard solutions for the dispersion of a 2D continuous source but none that allow for an initial source momentum or non-uniform velocity. As opposed to the near-field coflow approach used by other researchers we start from the far-field, modifying the simple diffusion models by perturbing the governing equations to allow for the initial momentum. Models are developed for both along-stream velocity and the concentration field of a tracer. From the velocity model, a comparison is made with experimental data available from one researcher (Wang, 1996) and an existing near-field coflow model PJCMERG (Davidson, 1989). The initial conditions (width and excess velocity) for our model are determined by Gaussian curve fitting to an arbitrary point in the near-field. The diffusivity parameter is used to adjust (tune) the model until the centreline velocity profile matches. We can always achieve this match and to a much closer degree than PJCMERG. There are no available laboratory or field data for concentrations of a tracer in a 2D coflowing jet although the near-field model PJCMERG does have a tracer component. We demonstrate how PJCMERG cannot converge to any far-field model, while our model provides a neat transition between the near-field and far-field. We have started the extension of the 2D model to the more common 3D situation although we have yet to carry out any comparisons with other models or data. The model development is included in an appendix for other researchers to pick up.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">two-dimensional jet</field><field name="subject">2D jet</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">fluid mechanics</field><field name="subject">velocity</field><field name="subject">far-field model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eco-sedimentological environments of an inter-tidal reef platform, Warraber Island, Torres Strait</field><field name="creator">Hart, Deirdre E., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines functional relationships between the morphologic, hydrodynamic, ecological and sedimentological characteristics of the Warraber reef platform, an inter-tidal reef island system, Central Torres Strait, Australia (10[degrees] 12??? S, 142 [degrees] 49??? E).  Hydrodynamic and sediment-transport experiments were conducted on the reef flat using current meters, water level recorders and directional sediment traps. Results showed dominantly SE flows during the dry season and more variable NW to SE flows during the wet season. Topography and reefal water levels modulated the direction and strength of currents and the generation of wind-waves on the reef flat as well as the passage of waves over the reef rim. These hydrodynamic conditions are sufficient to induce significant transport of moderately fast to slow settling sediment (&amp;gt-5.25 symbol psi) on the reef flat, though the platform as a whole is a relatively closed transport system.  Carbonate production was estimated based on the key ecological variables of live assemblage distribution and cover. Overall, only 24% of the reef flat was occupied by carbonate-producing organisms. The average estimated carbonate-production rate for the reef was 1.6 kgm -2y-1 (0.07-4.37 kgm-2y-1). Production is dominated by coral (73%), with subordinate proportions contributed by coralline algae (19%). And molluscs, foraminifera and Halimeda (&amp;lt4%) though actual reef-flat sediments did not reflect this potential. Instead, they were dominated by molluscs (35-55%), coralline algae (16-26%), coral (8-13%), Halimeda (7-8%) and foraminifera (5-10%). Differential rates of carbonate to sediment conversion meant the reef-platform sediments were more closely related to the cover of live organisms than to the contribution of carbonate production by each parent organism.  The settling properties of the least altered particles of the five commonest constituents were measured and these provided the basis for an eco-sedimentological model of the reef-platform system. Modelled textures were compared to the actual textures, indicating the degree of textural alteration resulting from a combination of biological and physical processes, including sediment production, hydraulic sorting and mechanical breakdown. This analysis, integrated with the hydrodynamic, exposure and other data, was used to determine reef-platform surface-sediment sources, sinks and transport pathways.  In using both the textual and constituent compositional properties of sediments, as well as information on local biological and physical processes, the model approach developed offers progress towards an integrative, interdisciplinary analysis of carbonate environments.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Warraber Island</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait</field><field name="subject">sediments</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">reef environments</field><field name="subject">ecosystem</field><field name="subject">beach morphology</field><field name="subject">reef flat</field><field name="subject">tidal</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">currents</field><field name="subject">waves</field><field name="subject">carbonate production</field><field name="subject">eco-sedimentology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ownership, organizational politics and information systems</field><field name="creator">Hart, Dennis, Computer Science, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of information systems and information management continue to present considerable challenges for many organizations, and more often than not for reason other than technological ones. Politically sensitive issues that are frequently raised by and bound up in such matters are an important cause of difficulties. This thesis proposes that perceptions of ownership of business processes and data by various groups within an organization can be a potent contributing factor in the occurrence of such political troubles. The thesis uses the new concept of information wards to develop a graphical model that links the scope of system development or organizational change and ownership perceptions to the likelihood of political difficulties. It then explores the links to organizational theory. The applicability and usefulness of the model is then argued through its application to a variety of case drawn from the information systems literature as well as case study project that provided the initial stimulus for the model???s development. It is shown that the model is capable of providing a variable explanation of the occurrence or absence of political troubles in the cases investigated. A prototype specialized group support system called Info*Warder based on the model has been built and is described in some detail. The software allows representative of organizational stakeholders to stake claims to business processes and data that are within the scope of systems development or change proposals, with the intention of permitting early detection of differences of opinion and potential conflicts. The thesis describes a research study in which the Info*Warder software was trialled within three Australia State Government departments. These departments were undergoing significant change both in their roles and information systems support arrangements and provided a useful test for the model and software. While the test was an indicative one only, it nevertheless showed that the software and its underlying theoretical model have the potential to assist in clarifying ownership issues related to information management and systems development in organizations, thereby helping to resolve them. Lastly, the thesis assesses how the developed model and software might fit into representative existing techniques and methodologies.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information systems</field><field name="subject">Organizational politics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ten years at the top : an analysis of the role of Air Marshal Sir George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff, Royal Australian Air Force, 1942-1952</field><field name="creator">Helson, Peter,  Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to examine the proposition that Air Marshal Sir George Jones??? time as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) of the Royal Australian Air force (RAAF) was both beneficial and detrimental to the Service but the benefits gained from his time in office outweighed the detriment. Sir George Jones served as CAS for nearly ten years (1942 - 1952). This was the longest continuous appointment of a CAS to date. Jones was CAS for most of the Second World War and it was during that time that the two events for which he is most remembered occurred, viz the controversy surrounding his appointment and his ongoing conflict with the RAAF Operational Commander (W.D. Bostock). In order to assess his impact on the RAAF, this thesis describes events and incidents that occurred while Jones was CAS. To compile this work, data was drawn from numerous sources including: interviews with family members and ex-RAAF personnel; official records maintained by the National Archives of Australia (NAA), the RAAF Historical Section and the RAAF Museum; Jones??? personal papers held by family members and the Australian War Memorial; and the papers of other RAAF officers and politicians held by the RAAF Museum and the National Library of Australia (NLA). Jones wrote a brief autobiography, which (together with other secondary sources) was used to ???fill in the gaps.??? This research shows that Jones??? time as CAS was far more eventful and filled with more conflict than he alludes to in his autobiography. He had no say in his appointment as CAS but his personality did not allow him to make the best of the situation with Bostock. Contrary to the views expressed in earlier works, Jones??? appointment was not a mistake but a deliberate move by the Minister for Air. The conclusion reached is that Jones??? time in office was beneficial to the RAAF. He presided over its growth to being the world???s fourth largest air force at the end of the Second World War. He oversaw its post war demobilisation and was responsible for planning the Service???s structure to meet the Australian Government???s needs during the early years of the Cold War.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">Officers</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">Sir George Jones</field><field name="subject">Chief of Air Staff</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">World War 1939-1945</field><field name="subject">W.H.

This thesis sets out to discuss the campaign by considering various factors that impacted on the RAAF in the lead up to and during the course of the Pacific war and their relevance to the campaign. It looks at the way air operations were conducted in the North-Western Area between 1942 and 1945 and describes the role played by the flying squadrons based in the area.  Using primary sources such as operational record books, documents and files at archives and libraries and interviews with veterans and experts the thesis found that the campaign was conducted in several phases. It started with the defence of Darwin. In keeping with overall allied strategy the RAAF then went on an offensive into what was then the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) using medium and heavy bombers and mine laying sea planes flying from bases in Australia???s north west.  The NEI was vital to the Japanese war effort as a source of essential raw materials such as oil, timber, and rubber. To defend this part of their new empire the Japanese had amassed large military garrisons on the islands. The vessels used to transport troops and materials became the most important targets for the RAAF???s bomber squadrons. As General MacArthur???s forces advanced along the north coast of New Guinea the North-Western Area based units conducted raids into the NEI to deceive the Japanese into thinking an invasion would be launched from Darwin. As the New  Guinea campaign gained momentum the RAAF???s task was to protect its western flank, to prevent the Japanese from moving troops and aircraft east to the Philippines.  The thesis concludes the campaign was successful because Darwin was defended, it denied the Japanese vital materials for the conduct of the war and it kept hundreds of aircraft and tens of thousands of troops away from the allied advance.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific War</field><field name="subject">North-Western Area</field><field name="subject">NW Area</field><field name="subject">Australian air power</field><field name="subject">air defence</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">air raids</field><field name="subject">North-Western Area</field><field name="subject">World War 2</field><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="subject">1941</field><field name="subject">1942</field><field name="subject">1943</field><field name="subject">1944</field><field name="subject">bombing offensive</field><field name="subject">seaplanes</field><field name="subject">fighter squadrons</field><field name="subject">NEI</field><field name="subject">Netherlands East Indies</field><field name="subject">Darwin</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Second World War</field><field name="subject">New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study on the impact of organisational culture and GSS on group decision outcomes</field><field name="creator">Huang, Hai-Shen, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines the impact of organisational culture and GSS (Group Support Systems) on small group decision-making as measured by group decision outcomes. Laboratory experiments were designed to investigate how two types of groups selected on the basis of having apparently different organisational cultures make decisions on a preference task, in situations where they were given one of two different means of support (face-to-face GSS support or manually structured support) to aid their decision-making. Organisational culture and GSS are the independent variables, whilst the dependent outcome variables were perceived decision quality, decision process satisfaction, decision satisfaction, unified commitment, collaborative climate, and group cohesiveness. The research results showed that manually-supported groups, those who were given simple physical decision-support aids and worked face-to-face, had higher perceived decision quality and decision process satisfaction but no significant differences in unified commitment, decision satisfaction, collaborative climate, and group cohesiveness were found when compared to face-to-face GSS???supported groups who were given electronic aids. One of the two groups drawn from environments where organisational culture was expected to be quite different, that is the Kensington Campus group had higher perceived decision quality, decision process satisfaction, unified commitment, and group cohesiveness but no significant differences in decision satisfaction and collaborative climate when compared with groups drawn from a campus of the same university, ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy) Campus, one which is attended only by military students. Whilst compared with those of manually structured support on group outcomes, the impacts of GSS on group outcomes weakened when they performed a preference task, organisational culture was found to have a significant impact on group outcomes when both face-to-face GSS and manual settings were considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group support systems</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">group decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental management and the international competitiveness of nature-based tourism destinations : the case of Tropical North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Huybers, Twan, Economics &amp; Management, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The natural environment is a key attraction for Australia???s tourism industry.  In order to prevent the deterioration of the environment, environmental management measures have been adopted by the tourism industry.  Some of these measures are related to environmental regulations imposed on tourism operators by governments.  However, given the dependence of the nature-based tourism industry on the environment, voluntary environmental management measures have also been instituted.  The objective of this thesis is to investigate the effect of environmental management on the competitiveness of a nature-based tourism destination.  For that purpose, Tropical North Queensland, a major Australian nature-based destination, is selected as a case study.  Competitiveness is measured by the aggregate profitability of the tourism industry in the destination region.  The investigation incorporates an assessment of the simultaneous effects of environmental management on the destination???s tourism demand and on business costs to tourism operators at the destination.  The conceptual background to the investigations is discussed in the first part of the thesis.  It includes the rationale for choosing a nature-based destination region as the unit of analysis.  The conceptual framework is a departure from the conventional analysis of the relationship between the environment and international competitiveness in which the effect of regulatory compliance costs is emphasised.  In this thesis, the potential demand benefits and the associated voluntary environmental management are added to the conventional analytical framework.  The primary data for the analysis are derived from two separate investigations.  The first comprises an analysis of the tourism industry in Tropical North Queensland.  The second investigation involves a discrete choice modelling analysis of destination choices by prospective visitors to Tropical North Queensland.  The empirical results show that it is justified to treat the nature-based tourism destination region, Tropical North Queensland, as an aggregate entity in the analysis.  The destination competes as a collective unit with other destinations.  This is done, predominantly, on the basis of the region???s high-quality natural attractions.  The empirical analyses show that tourism businesses??? costs due to environmental management are small in comparison with the positive demand effects.  The cost and demand effects are assessed in a quantitative fashion in an economic model.  That analysis shows that environmental management makes a positive contribution to Tropical North Queensland???s competitiveness as a nature-based tourism destination.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural environment</field><field name="subject">Environmental management</field><field name="subject">Nature-based tourism</field><field name="subject">Destination competitiveness</field><field name="subject">Profitability</field><field name="subject">Regional cooperation</field><field name="subject">Tourism demand</field><field name="subject">Choice modelling</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of Japan and Japanese people in Australian literature</field><field name="creator">Kato, Megumi, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a broadly chronological study of representations of Japan and the Japanese in Australian novels, stories and memoirs from the late nineteenth century to the twenty-first century.  Adopting Edward Said???s Orientalist notion of the `Other???, it attempts to elaborate patterns in which Australian authors describe and evaluate the Japanese.  As well as examining these patterns of representation, this thesis outlines the course of their development and change over the years, how they relate to the context in which they occur, and how they contribute to the formation of wider Australian views on Japan and the Japanese.    The thesis considers the role of certain Australian authors in formulating images and ideas of the Japanese ???Other???.  These authors, ranging from fiction writers to journalists, scholars and war memoirists, act as observers, interpreters, translators, and sometimes ???traitors??? in their cross-cultural interactions.  The thesis includes work from within and outside ???mainstream??? writings, thus expanding the contexts of Australian literary history. The major ???periods??? of Australian literature discussed in this thesis include: the 1880s to World War II; the Pacific War; the post-war period; and the multicultural period (1980s to 2000).  While a comprehensive examination of available literature reveals the powerful and continuing influence of the Pacific War, images of ???the stranger???, ???the enemy??? and later ???the ally??? or ???partner??? are shown to vary according to authors, situations and wider international relations.     This thesis also examines gender issues, which are often brought into sharp relief in cross-cultural representations.  While typical East-West power-relationships are reflected in gender relations, more complex approaches are also taken by some authors.  This thesis argues that, while certain patterns recur, such as versions of the ???Cho-Cho-San??? or ???Madame Butterfly??? story, Japan-related works have given some Australian authors, especially women, opportunities to reveal more ???liberated??? viewpoints than seemed possible in their own cultural context.     As the first extensive study of Japan in Australian literary consciousness, this thesis brings to the surface many neglected texts.  It shows a pattern of changing interests and interactions between two nations whose economic interactions have usually been explored more deeply than their literary and cultural relations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Authors</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Cowra</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">invasion novels</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">literary</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">memoirs</field><field name="subject">multicultural</field><field name="subject">Pacific War</field><field name="subject">post-war</field><field name="subject">short story</field><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="subject">World War II</field><field name="subject">Two</field><field name="subject">2</field><field name="subject">1939-1945</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life on the margins : the autobiographical fiction of Charles Bukowski</field><field name="creator">Bigna, Daniel, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Charles Bukowski devoted his writing career to turning his own life into poetry and prose. In poems and stories about his experiences as one of the working poor in post war America, and in those depicting his experiences as a writer of the American underground, Bukowski represents himself as both a literary and social outsider. Bukowski expresses an alternative literary aesthetic through his fictional persona, Henry Chinaski, who struggles to overcome his suffering in a world he finds absurd, and who embarks on a quest for freedom in his youth to which he remains committed all his life. This thesis examines Charles Bukowski's autobiographical fiction with a specific emphasis on five novels and one collection of short stories. In the novels, Post Office (1970), Factotum (1975), Women (1978), Ham on Rye (1982) and Hollywood (1989), and in a number of short stories in the collection Hot Water Music (1983), Bukowski explores different periods of Chinaski???s life with a dark humour, revealing links between Chinaski???s struggle with the absurd and those aspects comprising Bukowski???s alternative aesthetic. The thesis focuses on such aspects of Bukowski???s art as the uncommercial nature of his publishing history, his strong emphasis on literary simplicity, the appearance of the grotesque and Bukowski???s obsession with nonconformity, drinking and sex. These aspects illuminate the distinctive nature of Bukowski???s art and its purpose, which is the transformation of an ordinary life into literature.  This thesis argues that Bukowski illuminates possibilities that exist for individuals to create an identity for themselves through aesthetic self-expression. The thesis traces the development of Chinaski's non-conformist personality from Ham on Rye, based on Bukowski's youth in Los Angeles during the Depression, to Hollywood, Bukowski's ironic portrayal of Chinaski's brush with the commercial film industry. Through meeting the many challenges he faced throughout his life with defiance, honesty and an irreverent sense of humour, Bukowski invites readers to identify with his alternative world view. The thesis argues this particular aspect of his writing constitutes his most valuable contribution to twentieth century American fiction.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Charles Bukowski</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">aesthetic</field><field name="subject">novel</field><field name="subject">novels</field><field name="subject">literary. literature</field><field name="subject">non-conformist</field><field name="subject">Post Office</field><field name="subject">Factotum</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">ham on Rye</field><field name="subject">Hot Water Music</field><field name="subject">Hollywood</field><field name="subject">Henry Chinaski</field><field name="subject">autobiographical fiction</field><field name="subject">American</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the integration of qualitative and quantitative techniques for addressing systemic complexity in the context of organisational strategic decision-making</field><field name="creator">McLucas, Alan Charles, Civil Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">System dynamics modelling has been used for around 40 years to address complex, systemic, dynamic problems, those often described as wicked. But, system dynamics modelling is not an exact science and arguments about the most suitable techniques to use in which circumstances, continues. The nature of these wicked problems is investigated through a series of case studies where poor situational awareness among stakeholders was identified. This was found to be an underlying cause for management failure, suggesting need for better ways of recognising and managing wicked problem situations. Human cognition is considered both as a limitation and enabler to decision-making in wicked problem environments. Naturalistic and deliberate decision-making are reviewed. The thesis identifies the need for integration of qualitative and quantitative techniques. Case study results and a review of the literature led to identification of a set of principles of method to be applied in an integrated framework, the aim being to develop an improved way of addressing wicked problems. These principles were applied to a series of cases in an action research setting. However, organisational and political barriers were encountered. This limited the exploitation and investigation of cases to varying degrees. In response to a need identified in the literature review and the case studies, a tool is designed to facilitate analysis of multi-factorial, non-linear causality. This unique tool and its use to assist in problem conceptualisation, and as an aid to testing alternate strategies, are demonstrated. Further investigation is needed in relation to the veracity of combining causal influences using this tool and system dynamics, broadly. System dynamics modelling was found to have utility needed to support analysis of wicked problems. However, failure in a particular modelling project occurred when it was found necessary to rely on human judgement in estimating values to be input into the models. This was found to be problematic and unacceptably risky for sponsors of the modelling effort. Finally, this work has also identified that further study is required into: the use of human judgement in decision-making and the validity of system dynamics models that rely on the quantification of human judgement.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accidents</field><field name="subject">adaptive toolbox</field><field name="subject">Black Hawk</field><field name="subject">business process re-engineering</field><field name="subject">bounded rationality</field><field name="subject">BPR</field><field name="subject">CATWOE</field><field name="subject">causality</field><field name="subject">causal loop diagram</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">complex strategic problems</field><field name="subject">cognitive mapping</field><field name="subject">combat training centre</field><field name="subject">concept mapping</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">defence preparedness</field><field name="subject">double loop learning</field><field name="subject">dynamic behaviour</field><field name="subject">dynamic complexity</field><field name="subject">feedback</field><field name="subject">feedback loop</field><field name="subject">feedback structure</field><field name="subject">helicopter crash</field><field name="subject">heuristic</field><field name="subject">influence diagram</field><field name="subject">iterative and interactive strategy development</field><field name="subject">IISD</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">Katie Bender</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">managerial cognition</field><field name="subject">defence materiel</field><field name="subject">naturalistic decision making</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">qualitative modelling</field><field name="subject">quantitative modelling</field><field name="subject">recognition-primed decision making</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">root definition</field><field name="subject">Royal Canberra Hospital</field><field name="subject">situation awareness</field><field name="subject">soft systems methodology</field><field name="subject">strategy</field><field name="subject">strategy development</field><field name="subject">system dynamics front-end tool</field><field name="subject">system dynamics modelling</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">systems thinking</field><field name="subject">systemic problems</field><field name="subject">wicked problems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study in the limitations of command : General Sir William Birdwood and the A.I.F., 1914-1918</field><field name="creator">Millar, John Dermot, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Military command is the single most important factor in the conduct of warfare. To understand war and military success and failure, historians need to explore command structures and the relationships between commanders. In World War I, a new level of higher command had emerged: the corps commander. Between 1914 and 1918, the role of corps commanders and the demands placed upon them constantly changed as experiences brought illumination and insight. Yet the men who occupied these positions were sometimes unable to cope with the changing circumstances and the many significant limitations which were imposed upon them. Of the World War I corps commanders, William Birdwood was one of the longest serving. From the time of his appointment in December 1914 until May 1918, Birdwood acquired an experience of corps command which was perhaps more diverse than his contemporaries during this time. He is, then, an ideal subject for a prolonged assessment of this level of command.	This thesis has two principal objectives. The first is to identify and assess those factors which limited Birdwood???s capacity and ability to command. The second is to explore the institutional constraints placed on corps commanders during the 1914-1918 war.	Surprisingly, this is a comparatively barren area of research. Because very few officers spent much time as corps commanders on their way to higher command appointments and because the role of the corps commanders in military planning and in the conduct of operations was not immediately apparent, their role has been practically ignored. Historians have tended to concentrate on the Army and divisional levels creating a deficient view of higher military command in World War I. However, corps commanders could and did play an important part in planning operations and in military affairs generally. Birdwood???s experience at Gallipoli and in France reflect some of the changes to command structures that were prompted by the successes and failures of operations directed at the corps level. In as much as these two theatres of war were vastly different and Birdwood was confronted with dissimilar problems, it is possible to draw some general conclusions about the evolution of higher command after 1914.	Using a wide range of primary and secondary sources located in Australian and British archives, this thesis traces Birdwood???s career as a corps commander at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. It also examines his tenure as G.O.C. of the A.I.F.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">General William Birdwood</field><field name="subject">military command</field><field name="subject">command structures</field><field name="subject">officers</field><field name="subject">World War I</field><field name="subject">World War One</field><field name="subject">World War 1</field><field name="subject">1914-1918</field><field name="subject">military planning</field><field name="subject">operations</field><field name="subject">Army</field><field name="subject">Gallipoli</field><field name="subject">Western Front</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Australian Imperial Force (A.I.F.) corp command</field><field name="subject">corps commanders</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phoenix from the Ashes? : Russia???s defence industrial complex and its arms exports</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, C. S., Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The continued existence of the Russian defence and arms industry, known as the Oboronnyi Promyshennyi Kompleks (OPK), was called into question following the disintegration of the Soviet Empire in 1991. Industry experts cited the lack of a domestic market, endemic corruption, and excess capacity within the industry as factors underpinning its predicted demise. The most telling factor was the sudden removal of considerable government subsidies and high defence industry wages that had traditionally buttressed the industry's economic viability and encouraged the cream of Russia's workers into the sector. It was a crippling blow. However, the industry's export customers in China, India and Iran during those early years became the OPK's saving grace. Their orders introduced hard currency back into the industry and went a long way to preventing the forecasted OPK collapse. Although pessimistic predictions continued to plague the OPK throughout the 1990s, the valuable export dollars provided the OPK the breathing space it needed to claw back its competitive advantage as an arms producer. That revival has been further underpinned by a new political commitment, various research and development initiatives, and the restoration of defence industry as a tool of Russian foreign policy.    In order to gauge the future prospects for the OPK, it is necessary to examine the domestic and external drivers that have either underwritten its success to date or are still required to ensure its long term endurance. Domestically, continued success demands a closer collaboration between the OPK and the Russian armed forces. It also requires serious efforts to curb endemic corruption, further consolidation of the defence industry and continued development of the Russian domestic market for arms. Externally, the strength of the state arms exporter, Rosoboronexport, global market diversification and joint military ventures with strategic partner countries are essential ingredients for long term OPK success. Cultivating and maintaining the economic and political momentum vital for the OPK's progress will be a daunting undertaking for Russia. However, Russia's accomplishments in these key areas since 2000 suggest that continued success is a genuine prospect and that the OPK could potentially grow to be the proverbial 'phoenix from the ashes'.    China and India constitute approximately eighty percent of the total Russian arms transfer market. Trading and cooperation with these two countries has provided Moscow with the finances to sustain its defence industry through continued orders and valuable finance for research and development programmes for military hardware. However, post 2015, the Chinese market will be nearing total saturation and the Indian market will have contracted somewhat, as the indigenous defence industries of these nations can be expected to usurp the demand for Russian equipment. This scenario, together with a more active foreign policy under Putin has seen Russia launch aggressive marketing campaigns into the Middle East, South East Asia and Latin America. The strategy has already begun to pay dividends with large contracts being signed by Algeria, Indonesia, and Venezuela. The Russians hope that large sales to these countries will trigger further sales within the respective regions. The realised or potential contracts for arms from Libya, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Brazil suggest that this strategy is producing the desired result.    The short term future of the Russian OPK looks promising. The rising domestic defence order is beginning to challenge the export market as the OPK's most important customer. Meanwhile, exports will be safeguarded by continued foreign demand for niche Russian defence products such as cruise missiles and air defence systems as well as cost effective and user friendly Russian aircraft, ships, submarines and land systems. Flexible financing options offered by Rosoboronexport will stimulate demand in new markets such as Algeria and Indonesia and sustain the economic viability of the OPK for at least the next decade.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Weapons industry</field><field name="subject">Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">defense industries</field><field name="subject">arms transfers</field><field name="subject">military policy</field><field name="subject">Oboronnyi Promyshennyi Kompleks (OPK)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Triumph of improvisation : Australian Army operational logistics and the campaign in Papua, July 1942 to January 1943</field><field name="creator">Moremon, John Clifford, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Australia Army???s campaign on Papua from July 1942 to January 1943 with the focus on logistic support of the fighting arms and the relation of logistics to the tactics of tropical jungle warfare. It begins by examining the traditional approach to logistics in the military profession - the experience of Australian officers and forces in particular - from the First World War until May 1942, when the Australian territory of Papua was invaded. It establishes that the Army was poorly prepared because, as well as having never anticipated a prolonged land campaign in Papua-New Guinea, it lacked the logistic resources and knowledge of logistics as applicable to tropical jungle warfare. It then proceeds to examine the retreat over the Kokoda Track and the turning-point battles for Milne Bay and Imita Ridge. It demonstrates that the principal factor in the Australian retreat was logistic failure, as geography and lack of logistic resources prevented adequate supply of the fighting arms at least until lines of communication had been shortened; even then, difficulties remained. The thesis is rounded off by assessing the counter-attack across the territory of Papua for the capture of the enemy???s beachheads at Buna, Gona and Sanananda. It concludes that, as the island???s geography and tropical environment so dominated operations and since shortages of logistic equipment and units persisted, the Army could not perfect its logistic organisation by the end of this first phase of the New Guinea campaign. It fell back on improvisation and the fortitude of troops to triumph over the Japanese.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua new Guinea</field><field name="subject">Kokoda Track</field><field name="subject">Milne bay</field><field name="subject">Imita Ridge</field><field name="subject">Buna</field><field name="subject">Gona</field><field name="subject">Sanananda</field><field name="subject">logistics</field><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="subject">World War 2</field><field name="subject">World War II</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Australia.

The organization, command, training, equipment, social composition, recruitment and retention of Australia???s citizen soldiers are examined in an effort to discover the solution to this problem.  The conclusion reached is that Australia???s citizen soldiers could not have fulfilled their roles, the nature of which was widely debated by British and Australian defence planners because of their differing threat perceptions. Inter-Service rivalry over money also encouraged this debate.  Basically, the A.M.F. did not have the equipment and trained troops to enable it to concentrate in time to repel a Japanese raid or invasion. Motor vehicles could have provided this mobility but their expense was prohibitive. However, in other respects the Military Board failed to make the best use of its resources. Slight changes in organization and the command structure might have made the C.M.F., once concentrated, more efficient and better able to fight the Japanese. More attention paid to ensuring that training was imaginative and interesting then might have led to higher retention rates, thereby eliminating the expensive and wasteful requirement for constant recruiting campaigns</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Citizen soldiers</field><field name="subject">soldier</field><field name="subject">command</field><field name="subject">organization</field><field name="subject">recruitment</field><field name="subject">retention</field><field name="subject">equipment</field><field name="subject">Citizen Military Forces</field><field name="subject">CMF</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">social composition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conjunctive use of bonded repairs and crack growth retardation techniques</field><field name="creator">Kieboom, Orio Terry,  Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In an attempt to find a way of improving the damage tolerance of composite bonded repairs to metallic aircraft structures, the effect of using conventional crack growth retardation techniques in conjunction with bonded repairs was experimentally investigated.  Hence, an experimental test program was set up to determine whether fatigue crack growth under bonded repairs is retarded further by giving the crack to be repaired a crack growth retardation treatment prior to repair patch application. In addition, it was set up to determine the influence of a bonded repair on the effectiveness of a crack growth retardation method. Centrally cracked aluminium plates were used. Stop drilling followed by cold hole expansion and the application of single overloads were selected as retardation treatments. Two patch materials were considered; boron/epoxy and Glare 2. Further test variables were the aluminium alloy and the plate thickness.  Fatigue testing was carried out under constant amplitude loading and baseline results were determined first. In addition to optically monitoring the crack growth, local and global out-of-plane deformations were visualised with holographic interferometry and shadow moire??. Furthermore, the stress intensity factors under the repair patch were examined with strain gauges and measurement of the central crack opening displacement. Disbonds and fracture surfaces were studied after residual strength tests.  The crack growth results obtained showed that retardation treatments decrease crack growth rates under a repair patch and that the effectiveness of a retardation treatment is increased by the patch. Although identical crack growth rates were observed under boron/epoxy and Glare 2 patches, the reinitiation period after the retardation treatment lasted longer when Glare 2 patches were applied. Analytical predictions of the extent of retardation based on existing models showed that the conjunctive effect of retardation treatments and bonded repairs was underestimated. A sustained reduction in crack growth rates was observed under bonded repairs with a prior overload retardation treatment.  It was concluded that the damage tolerance of bonded repairs is increased by the application of a crack growth retardation treatment because the crack growth is retarded further. These findings indicate that the range of cracks in aircraft for which bonded repairs can be considered is expanded and that economic benefits can be obtained.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airframes</field><field name="subject">fatigue crack growth</field><field name="subject">cracking</field><field name="subject">repair patch</field><field name="subject">bonded repair</field><field name="subject">aluminium plates</field><field name="subject">crack growth retardation treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The political consequences of military operations in Indonesia 1945-99 : a fieldwork analysis of the political power-diffusion effects of guerilla conflict</field><field name="creator">Kilcullen, David J., Politics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem Investigated. This dissertation is a study of the political effects of low-intensity warfare in Indonesia since 1945. In particular, it examines the interaction between general principles and contextual variables in guerrilla conflict, to determine whether such conflict causes the diffusion of political power.  Analysis of insurgent movements indicates that power structures within a guerrilla group tend to be regionalised, diffuse and based on multiple centres of roughly equal authority. Conversely, studies of counter-insurgency (COIN) techniques indicate that successful COIN depends on effective political control over the local population. This tends to be exercised by regional or local military commanders rather than by central authority. Based on this, the author???s initial analysis indicated that one should expect to see a diffusion of political authority from central leaders (whether civilian or military) to regional military leaders, when a society is engaged in the conduct of either COIN or guerrilla warfare.  The problem investigated in this dissertation can therefore be stated thus:  To what extent, at which levels of analysis and subject to what influencing factors does low-intensity warfare in Indonesia between 1945 and 1999 demonstrate a political power-diffusion effect?  Procedures Followed. The procedure followed was a diachronic, qualitative, fieldwork-based analysis of two principle case studies:  the Darul Islam insurgency in West Java 1948-1962 and the campaign in East Timor 1974-1999. Principle research tools were:  ???	Semi-structured, formal, informal and group interviews.  ???	Analysis of official and private archives in Australia, Indonesia, the Netherlands and the UK.  ???	Participant observation using anthropological fieldwork techniques.  ???	Geographical analysis using transects, basemapping and overhead imagery.  ???	Demographic analysis using historical data, cartographic records and surveys.  Research was conducted in Australia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bandung), the Netherlands (The Hague and Amsterdam) and the United Kingdom (London, Winchester, Salisbury and Warminster). Fieldwork was conducted over three periods in West Java (1994, 1995 and 1996) and one period in East Timor (1999-2000).  General Results Obtained. The two principal case studies were the Darul Islam insurgency in West Java 1948-62 and the campaign in East Timor since 1974.  The fieldwork data showed that low-intensity warfare in Indonesia between 1945 and 1999 did indeed demonstrate the political power-diffusion effect posited by the author. This effect was triggered by the outbreak of guerrilla warfare, which itself flowed from crises generated by processes of modernisation and change within Indonesian society from traditional hierarchies to modern forms of social organisation. These crises were also affected by events at the systemic and regional levels of analysis ??? the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies by Japan, the Cold War, the Asian financial crisis and increasing economic and media globalisation. They resulted in a breakdown or weakening of formal power structures, allowing informal power structures to dominate. This in turn allowed local elites with economic, social or religious influence and with coercive power over the population, to develop political and military power at the local level while being subject to little control from higher levels. This process, then, represented a power diffusion from central and civilian leadership levels to local leaders with coercive means ??? most often military or insurgent leaders.  Having been triggered by guerrilla operations, however, the direction and process by which such power diffusion operated was heavily influenced by contextual variables, of which the most important were geographical factors, political culture, traditional authority structures and the interaction of external variables at different levels of analysis. Topographical isolation, poor infrastructure, severe terrain, scattered population groupings and strong influence by traditional hierarchies tend to accelerate and exacerbate the loss of central control. Conversely good infrastructure, large population centres, good communications and a high degree of influence by nation-state and systemic levels of analysis ??? particularly through economic and governmental institutionalisation ??? tend to slow such diffusion. Moreover, while power may be diffusing at one level of analysis (e.g. nation-state) it may be centralising at another (e.g. into the hands of military leaders at local level).  Analysis of the Malayan Emergency indicates that, in a comparable non-Indonesian historical example, the same general tendency to political power diffusion was evident and that the same broad contextual variables mediated it. However, it would be premature to conclude that the process observed in Indonesia is generally applicable. The nature and relative importance of contextual factors is likely to vary between examples and hence additional research on non-Indonesian examples would be necessary before such a conclusion could be drawn. Further research on a current instance of guerrilla operations in Indonesia is also essential before the broader contemporary applicability of these findings can be reliably demonstrated.  Major Conclusions Reached. Based on the above, the theses developed to answer the initial problem can be stated thus:  The command and control (C2) structures inherent in traditional, dispersed rural guerrilla movements that lack access to mass media or electronic communications tend to lessen the degree of control by central (military or political) leaders over regional leaders.  If COIN or Internal Security Operations are conducted, two factors will operate. First, there will be an increase in the degree of control over the civil population by local military leaders, at the expense of local or central political leaders. Second, where military command structures are pyramidal or segmentary, there will be an increase in control by local commanders at the expense of central military leaders. Where the central government is civilian or has interests divergent from the military???s, the first of these factors will dominate. Where the government is military or has interests largely identical to those of the military, the second factor will be dominant.  The process of power diffusion can thus be summarised as follows:  A crisis driven by processes of societal change or by external causes, leads to the outbreak of violence, one facet of which may include guerrilla operations. If guerrilla operations do occur, the C2 structures inherent in such operations give a high degree of autonomy and independence to local military leaders.  The same (or a contemporaneous) crisis produces a breakdown of formal power structures, causing organisations to fall back upon informal power structures.  The nature of these informal power structures is determined by geography, political culture, patterns of traditional authority within the society and the degree of interaction of systemic/regional factors with local events.  Thus the guerrilla operations and the concomitant breakdown in formal power structures form the trigger for political power diffusion. The precise nature and progress of this diffusion is then determined by contextual variables.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Low-intensity conflicts (Military science)</field><field name="subject">Civil-military relations</field><field name="subject">Guerrilla warfare</field><field name="subject">Insurgency</field><field name="subject">counter-insurgency</field><field name="subject">West Java</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">political power</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">Darul Islam</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nearby young [special character] Chamaeleontis cluster as a laboratory for star formation and evolution</field><field name="creator">Lyo, A-Ran, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">[Special characters cannot be displayed. Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.] We studied the circumstellar discs, the initial mass function (IMF), mass distribution, binarity and the fundamental properties of the [special character] 9 Myr-old pre-main sequence (PMS)  [special character] Chamaeleontis cluster. Using JHKL colour-colour and colour-excess diagrams, we found the circumstellar disc fraction to be [special character] 0.60 among the late-type members. Four stars with [special character] (K - L) &gt; 0.4 were identified as experiencing ongoing accretion which was later confirmed by high-resolution spectroscopic study. Quantitative analysis of the H[special character] profiles found accretion in these four stars at rates comparable to that of two members of the similarly-aged TW Hydrae Association (TWA); rates 1 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than in younger classical T Tauri stars. Together these results suggest that, while the mass accretion rate decreases with age, PMS stars can retain their inner discs for [special character] 10 Myr. An optical photometric survey spanning 1.3 ?? 1.3 pc added two low-mass stars to the cluster inventory. Together with other recent surveys the population is likely to be significantly complete for primaries with masses M &gt; 0.15M[special character]. The cluster now consists of 18 primaries and 9 confirmed and candidate secondaries, with [special character] 2-4 times higher multiplicity than seen in field dwarfs. The cluster IMF is consistent with that of rich young clusters and field stars. By extending the IMF to lower masses, we predict 20-29 low-mass stars and brown dwarfs may remain undiscovered. From study of the cluster???s spatial and mass distribution, we find the [special character] Cha cluster has significant mass segregation, with &gt; 50 per cent of the stellar mass residing within the central 0.17 pc. Lastly we classified members of the cluster with low-resolution spectra, providing information about the fundamental properties of the PMS stars by comparison to standard dwarfs.

The field monitoring of settlements for over six years shows that the embankment manifests significant creep. The instrumentation, field performance and the finite element analyses for predicting the long-term performance of this embankment are described in this thesis.  The maximum settlement of 1.1 m was observed one year after the completion of construction. However, the embankment continued to settle at a rate of 0.4 mm/day for the next 5 years. The horizontal displacements of 0.09-0.14 m at various locations and the maximum reinforcement strains of 0.67% were recorded.  A numerical model was developed to perform a fully coupled large deformation elasto-viscoplastic finite element analysis for this performance prediction based on creep model proposed by Kutter and Sathialingam (1992). The foundation soil was modelled with creep material behaviour using six noded linear strain triangular elements. A well-documented case history ??? Sackville embankment, New Brunswick, Canada was analysed using this model as a benchmark problem and the model was found to predict all the behaviour characteristics reasonably well. The results obtained from finite element analysis using this model are shown to be in reasonable agreement with the observed performance of Leneghans embankment in terms of settlements, horizontal displacements, excess pore pressures and geosynthetic strains. But, the prediction of settlements was less than satisfactory beyond April 1999.  Finite element analyses were performed to study the sensitivity of this embankment behaviour on the variation of hydraulic conductivity values and geosynthetic reinforcement properties. This sensitivity study indicated that the kv variation, the kh/kv ratio and the nominal values of geosynthetic properties adopted in the benchmark analysis are reasonable enough for the long-term behaviour prediction.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clay soil</field><field name="subject">creep behaviour</field><field name="subject">deformations</field><field name="subject">elastoplastic</field><field name="subject">elasto-viscoplastic</field><field name="subject">embankment</field><field name="subject">embankments</field><field name="subject">finite element program</field><field name="subject">geosynthetic</field><field name="subject">geotechnical structures</field><field name="subject">Leneghans</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">mathematical</field><field name="subject">reinforced</field><field name="subject">reinforcement</field><field name="subject">soft soils</field><field name="subject">vertical drains</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The once and future Army : an organizational, political and social history of the Citizen Military Forces, 1947-1974</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Dayton S., History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) from 1947 until it ceased to exist under that name with the release of the report of the Millar Inquiry in 1974. This thesis examines three broad areas: the organizational changes that the CMF adopted or had imposed upon it; the political decision-making surrounding the CMF; and a social analysis of the CMF which questions the viability and validity of a number of the CMF???s long held precepts. The thesis will show that the majority of circumstances and decisions surrounding the CMF were beyond its control. For example, the CMF could not change the prevailing military thought of the post-war period which emphasized increasingly the role of smaller, professional, readily-available armies. The first three chapters recount the CMF???s ???heyday??? in which the Army, assisted by National Service after 1950, was based around it and its influence at the highest levels was strongest.  The next two chapters chronicle the background to Australia???s adoption of the  ???Pentropic??? organization and the repercussions this had on the CMF. Chapters Six and Seven examine the consequences of the introduction of a second compulsory service scheme and the concomitant result which precluded the CMF from operational service in Vietnam. Chapters Eight and Nine deal with the Millar Inquiry, which offered the CMF a new hope, but in some regards, brought forth little beneficial gains for the CMF. The final chapters analyze some of the characteristics unique to the CMF, such as territorial affiliation, high turnover rates amongst the rank and file and the concept of the ???brilliant amateur???. This thesis concludes that, despite the mixed performance of the CMF, there is still a place for the citizen soldier in contemporary warfare, but far more consideration at the highest political and military levels must be given to the peculiar and difficult, but by no means insurmountable, problems citizen soldiering encounters in Australia.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CMF</field><field name="subject">Citizen Military Force</field><field name="subject">Australian citizen soldier</field><field name="subject">Army Reserve</field><field name="subject">Citizen Army</field><field name="subject">Post-War CMF</field><field name="subject">CMF Officer Corps</field><field name="subject">CMF NCO</field><field name="subject">CMF Non-commissioned officers</field><field name="subject">CMF Officers</field><field name="subject">Defence Act</field><field name="subject">Military planning</field><field name="subject">Defence planning</field><field name="subject">Organizational structure</field><field name="subject">Social analysis</field><field name="subject">Millar Inquiry</field><field name="subject">Selective Service</field><field name="subject">National Service</field><field name="subject">Pentropic Division</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vietnam between China &amp; the United States (1950-1995)</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thach Hong, Politics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vietnam is a tragic land, which has witnessed three successive wars since it won independence in 1945. The purpose of this dissertation is to seek answers to the question of why so many tragedies struck the Vietnamese people, and in particular to examine the contribution made by Sino-American competition to this tragic history.	Analysing the IMPACT of Sino-American relations on Chinese and American policies towards Vietnam, the study finds that Vietnam never was the primary subject of American foreign policy, though America was deeply involved in Vietnam during the twenty-five years between 1950 and 1975. Washington???s Vietnam policy was largely based on its perception of China. Likewise, Beijing???s policy towards Vietnam was greatly affected by the state of its relations with Washington.	Vietnam was a victim of their confrontation. The analysis shows that the increase in American involvement during the last stage of the first Vietnam War and the start of the second Vietnam War was due to enmity between China and the United States. US neglect was a result of Sino-American rapprochement while US isolation of Vietnam resulted from Sino-American strategic co-operation. Though the third Vietnam War was a consequence of Sino-Soviet competition, Washington also indirectly encouraged Beijing to be tough with Vietnam, as it needed Chinese support in its relations with Moscow.	Analysing changes in Chinese and American polices towards Vietnam, the study observes that when a small state is caught in an intra-power struggle, bug powers will always try to use the small state as a tool in their rivalry. The main lesson for small states is to avoid being caught in such big-power competition. Politicians in small states should also avoid taking sides with big powers lest this create opportunities for big power interference and draw the small state into big power competition. This needs the political acumen and flexibility to distinguish national interest from self-interest.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">American</field><field name="subject">America</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">foreign policy</field><field name="subject">foreign relations</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">reunification</field><field name="subject">Sino-American confrontation</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese conflict</field><field name="subject">war</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Static liquefaction of sand with a small amount of fines</field><field name="creator">Bobei, Doru, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can not be reproduced here. Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.] The thesis provides a comprehensive study on the behaviour of sand with a small amount of fines [i.e.1/3 plastic fines and 2/3 non-plastic fines]. The work is carried out experimentally under axi-symmetric conditions using the triaxial apparatus. Conventional drained triaxial tests are conducted on isotropic consolidated specimens and all the tests indicate that sand with fines does not manifest any unusual behaviour under drained conditions. However in undrained shearing the so-called ???reverse behaviour??? is noted. The study demonstrates that the reverse behaviour conforms to the critical state framework because significant changes in the position and geometry of the critical state [CS] and isotropic consolidation [IL] lines are caused by the presence of fines. These changes cannot be adequately modelled by the intergranular void ratio as proposed by Thevanayagam and Mohan (2000). This study also demonstrates that the original state parameter [special character] as proposed by Been and Jefferies (1985) is not an adequate parameter to predict the undrained behaviour trend. A new parameter termed ???modified state parameter??? [special character] is proposed to account for the combined effects of density and confining pressure. The suitability of the modified state parameter to characterise the response of parent sand and sand with fines is assessed for a range of void ratios and confining pressures. The effect of drained stress history is an important factor affecting the subsequent undrained response. Drained pre-shearing to failure is found to improve considerably the subsequent undrained response to the extent that liquefaction may not occur. Different drained pre-shearing histories have different effects on the undrained response. However in these tests [special character] has limitations in quantifying the subsequent undrained stress-strain response. Hence, a new framework of ???yielding parameter??? [special character] extends the capability of [special character] and additional data is presented to demonstrate the suitability of this concept. The implementation of [special character] depends on whether the previous stress state reached during the stress history is below or at failure. The effects of drained pre-shearing on the position and movement of failure surface are investigated. It is found that drained pre-shearing to failure at larger confining pressures has the effect of shifting upwards part of the drained failure surface. The shift at larger stress ratios [special character] may be described in terms of dilatancy and modified state parameter at failure. The so-called strain path tests are conducted to study the influence of strain increment ratio on the deformation behaviour of sand with fines. It is found that the value of [special character] has significant effects on the stress-strain behaviour. Along negative [special character] paths the soil strain softens in the form of decreasing the shear resistance before reaching the failure state. In contrast, along positive [special character] paths the soil strain hardens to an asymptotic stress ratio. The asymptotic stress ratio decreases with increasing [special character] along a linear relationship. The framework of [special character] cannot quantify the stress-strain response along positive and negative strain paths. Consequently an ???instability parameter??? [special character] is proposed to extend the capabilities of [special character] and the reliability of this parameter is further assessed. The behaviour along a range of positive and negative [special character] paths is investigated on pre-sheared specimens. In negative [special character] the effective stress paths reach a surface located higher than the monotonic failure surface on which they trace downward towards the origin of stress space. The results indicate this surface may be the same as the drained failure envelope which has been shifted as a result of drained pre-shearing. In positive [special character] paths a large improvement is noted in both the strength and stiffness of the soil. Note The parameters [special character] and [special character] are all generalisations of [special character] so that the behaviour under complex conditions can be characterised.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Axi-symmetric</field><field name="subject">fines</field><field name="subject">instability</field><field name="subject">liquefaction</field><field name="subject">modified state parameter</field><field name="subject">sand</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">strain path testing</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">triaxial</field><field name="subject">undrained</field><field name="subject">yielding parameter</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Law and politics : Australia's war crimes trials in the Pacific, 1943-1961</field><field name="creator">Pappas, Caroline, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the trial of Japanese war crimes conducted by Australia between 1945 and 1951; although the study commences in 1943, when the Government first focussed on the issue, and ends in 1961, when the issue was closed. Beyond providing an overview of the trials the thesis addresses the major criticism of the trials by looking at whether the trails were fair and if they fulfilled Australian aims. This is addressed within the context of the two elements of international law, the political, and the legal, and examined in each of the three sections.  The Policy section establishes the political context of the trials by examining the influence of the international community and the Australian Government. Both influenced structure and progress rather than the final application of the law. When Australian attitudes were incongruous with international views, a perception that Australia was harsh and repressive developed even though justice was an important part of the Government???s agenda.  A study of legal aspects of the trials commences in the Procedures section. Australia???s legislation and regulations are explained with particular emphasis on the more controversial aspects, and a comparison is made with the war crimes instruments of other Allies trying the Japanese showing many similarities between the regulations used by other nations and Australia???s. Procedures also discusses the framework for the Australian trials, the procedures used to bring a case to trial, the process used in court, the review process and the carrying out of sentences. Such a thorough study of the procedural basis is necessary to evaluate the individual trials.  Practical examples of some of the procedural problems are also discussed in the following section ??? Practice. This section reviews a number of trials and the various types of crimes and the claims made in defence to show how Australia applied and interpreted the law. The study finds many similarities between Australia???s application of the law and the practice of other nations, indicating that Australian courts were applying what was considered to be customary expectations of behaviour.  Throughout the trials there was little evidence of vindictiveness or revenge, either by Government or in the courts. Both were faced with significant problems, which were not always dealt with well but overall the trials were fair and those involved were concerned that justice should not only be seen to be done, but actually be done.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">allied</field><field name="subject">courts</field><field name="subject">crimes</field><field name="subject">imprisonment</field><field name="subject">investigations</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="subject">Kavieng</field><field name="subject">Laha Airfield</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">legal</field><field name="subject">legislation</field><field name="subject">massacre</field><field name="subject">murder</field><field name="subject">Ocean island</field><field name="subject">prisoners of war</field><field name="subject">prison camps</field><field name="subject">procedures</field><field name="subject">regulations</field><field name="subject">release</field><field name="subject">sentences</field><field name="subject">Tan Toey</field><field name="subject">theft</field><field name="subject">trials</field><field name="subject">War Crimes Act 1945</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat fragmentation and the southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus at multiple spatial scales</field><field name="creator">Paull, David James, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the process of habitat fragmentation and the spatial and temporal scales at which it occurs. Fragmentation has become an important topic in biogeography and conservation biology because of the impacts it has upon species??? distributions and biodiversity. Various definitions of fragmentation are available but in this research it is considered to be the disruption of continuity, either natural or human-induced in its origins and operative at multiple spatial scales. Using the distribution of the southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus as a case study, three spatial scales of fragmentation were analysed. At the continental scale, the Australian distribution of the subspecies I. o. obesulus was examined in relation to climate, geology and vegetation cover at the time of European settlement of Australia and two centuries later. Using archived wildlife records and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analyses, habitat suitability models were created to assess natural and human-induced fragmentation of the distribution of I. obesulus in 1788 and 1988. At the regional scale, a study was made of the distribution of I. obesulus in the south-east of the State of South Australia. Again, natural and human-induced patterns of habitat fragmentation were modelled using GIS with climate, soil and vegetation data for the time of European settlement and at present. At the local scale, the distribution of I. obesulus was the subject of a detailed field survey of 372 sites within 29 remnant patches of native vegetation in south-eastern South Australia in order to understand the variables that cause habitat fragmentation. Geographic information systems were used again but in a different way to carefully stratify the field survey by overlaying maps of topography, vegetation and past fires. The large dataset collected from the surveys was described using six generalized linear models which identified the significant variables that fragment the distribution of I. obesulus at a local scale. From the results of the field surveys, a subset of four remnants was chosen for further GIS spatial modelling of the probability of I. obesulus occurring within remnants in response to fire via a controlled burning programme put in place to reduce accumulating fuel loads. These investigations show that habitat fragmentation can be caused by different factors at different spatial scales. At the continental scale, it was found that climate played a dominant role in influencing the fragmented distribution of I. obesulus but vegetation change during the past two centuries has also had a profound impact on the availability of habitat. Within south-eastern South Australia, the species??? regional scale distribution is constrained by climate and also by soil and vegetation patterns. Dramatic change to its regional distribution occurred in the 20th century as a result of the clearance of native vegetation for planting pastures, crops and pines. Fragmentation at the regional scale has resulted in the remaining habitat being reduced to small, isolated, remnant patches of native vegetation. At the local scale it was found that variables which disrupt the continuity of I. obesulus habitat within remnants include vegetation cover in the 0-1 m stratum, abundance of Xanthorrhoea australis and soil texture. For a subset of sites located in one landsystem of the study area, named Young, the age of vegetation since it was last burnt was also found to be a significant variable, with vegetation 10-14 years old since burning providing the most suitable habitat. Spatial modelling of two scenarios for prescribed burning over 15 years revealed that the use of fire as a habitat enhancement tool will be complicated and require a detailed understanding of the factors that cause natural fragmentation in the distribution of I. obesulus at the local scale. A further conclusion of the study was that ecological relationships between species and their habitats require careful interpretation of multi-scaled datasets and conservation plans for endangered species ought to be made at multiple spatial scales. Future research directions are identified including the linking of multi-scaled habitat fragmentation models to genetic studies of the species throughout its range.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Southern brown bandicoot</field><field name="subject">Isoodon obesulus</field><field name="subject">habitat modification</field><field name="subject">fire</field><field name="subject">scale distribution</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="subject">continental</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="subject">local</field><field name="subject">marsupial</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">vegetation</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems (GIS)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuel moisture and fuel dynamics in woodland and heathland vegetation of the Sydney Basin</field><field name="creator">Pippen, Brendan Gerard, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The vegetation of the Sydney Basin, Australia, is highly flammable and subject to a wide range of fire regimes. Sclerophyllous shrubs and sedges are common and in some vegetation types up to 70 % of fuel consumed during a fire can be live. Research into fire behaviour and fuel dynamics has been minimal. To address this issue this thesis investigated the principal factor affecting the ease of ignition and rate of combustion of individual fuel particles and fuel beds in bushfires: dead fine fuel moisture (FFM). Two common Sydney Basin vegetation types, eucalypt woodland and heathland, each with a history of problematic fire management, were measured in the field for diurnal fluctuations in FFM following rain, under conditions similar to when prescribed burns are conducted. The FFM components of current operational fire behaviour models were found to be inadequate for predictions of FFM and fire behaviour under these conditions.  The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of five fuel types from the field site was investigated in a laboratory study. An existing function describing EMC as a function of temperature and relative humidity was evaluated and found to be very accurate for these fuels. Two FFM predictive models incorporating this function were evaluated on the field data and the laboratory results were shown to be applicable to the estimation of FFM in the field. One model gave very accurate predictions of FFM below fibre saturation point, but its accuracy was reduced when screen level conditions were used instead of those measured at fuel level. A recent process-based model that accounts for rainfall showed promise for predicting when fuel is &lt; 25 % FFM. Systematic problems with the radiation budget of this model reduced the accuracy of predictions and further refinement is required.  Live fine fuel moisture content (LFMC) of common heathland shrubs and sedge was investigated over two years and found to be both seasonal and influenced by phenology. LFMC minima occurred in late winter and spring (August to October), and maxima were in summer (December to February) when new growth was recorded. The dominant near-surface fuel in mature heath was sedge. It was found to have little seasonal variation in its??? percentage dead but the percentage dead maxima occured at the same time as the LFMC minima of shrubs and sedge in both years.  Simple instantaneous models for duff moisture content in woodland and heathland and LFMC and the percentage dead sedge in heathland were developed. The information gained by this study will form the basis for future development of fuel moisture models for prescribed burning guidelines and fire spread models specific to the vegetation communities of the Sydney Basin.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">eucalypt woodland</field><field name="subject">heathland shrubs</field><field name="subject">fuel moisture content</field><field name="subject">bushfires</field><field name="subject">forest fires</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial forecasting using artificial neural networks</field><field name="creator">Prasad, Jayan Ganesh, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the extent of a theoretical framework in financial market studies, a vast majority of the traders, investors and computer scientists have relied only on technical and timeseries data for predicting future prices. So far, the forecasting models have rarely incorporated macro-economic and market fundamentals successfully, especially with short-term predictions ranging less than a month. In this investigation on the predictability of certain financial markets, an attempt has been made to incorporate a un-exampled and encompassing set of parameters into an Artificial Neural Network prediction system. Experiments were carried out on three market instruments ??? namely currency exchange rates, share prices and oil prices. The choice of parameters for inclusion or exclusion, and the time frame adopted for the experimental sets were derived from the market literature. Good directional prediction accuracies were achieved for currency exchange rates and share prices with certain parameters as inputs, which consisted of predicting short-term movements based on past movements. These predictions were better than the results produced by a traditional least square prediction method. The trading strategy developed based on the predictions also achieved a higher percentage of winning trades. No significant predictions were observed for oil prices. These results open up questions in the microstructure of the markets and provide an insight into the inputs required for market forecasting in the corresponding time frame, for future investigation. The study concludes by advocating the use of trend based input parameters and suggests ways to improve neural network forecasting models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">financial forecasting</field><field name="subject">foreign exchange market</field><field name="subject">stock market prediction</field><field name="subject">crude oil prices prediction</field><field name="subject">financial markets</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender ideology and narrative form in the novels of Henry Handel Richardson</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Catherine Cecilia, English, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a feminist reading of the work of Henry Handel Richardson (1870-1946), which considers her four major novels: Maurice Guest (1908), The Getting of Wisdom (1910), The Fortunes of Richard Mahony (1930), and The Young Cosima (1939). It proposes that Richardson foregrounds the work of gender ideology in her novels, and that her work is also conscious about its own fictional procedures. This thesis argues that Richardson consciously examines the ideological aspect of narrative modes, such as naturalism, the Bildungsroman, and popular romance. Moreover, it illustrates her attempts to invent narrative strategies which subvert the conventional assumptions about gender inherent in those forms. ???Gender Ideology and Narrative Form??? draws on recent theoretical approaches to narrative, ideology, subjectivity, and dialogism, to argue that Richardson makes the ideological shaping of her stories most visible through manipulations of genre, plot, narrative voice, and point of view. Aspects of ideology examined include the Victorian and late-Victorian equation of masculinity with public rationality, mind, public achievement, and genius: and, on the other hand, the association of femininity with the body, passion, and private or domestic spaces. The thesis also considers some of the values and assumptions about gender implicit in nineteenth-century scientific thinking. Henry Handel Richardson has been viewed as a conservative writer, in both aesthetic and political terms. By contrast, I suggest that she resists the moral and representational codes of the realist or naturalist form, and that her uncompromising oppositional strategy achieves a number of radical results. It exposes and criticises the masculinist bias of certain representational methods; it offers new ways of representing female experience; and it insists that the private sphere must be treated also as a political space in which crucial power relationships are at work.

This thesis is the first attempt to fill this gap in our knowledge and understanding of the history of the Australian Army. In doing so it will consider the ways in which the Light Horse evolved, the place it had in defence thinking, the development of its doctrine, its organisational changes and the way in which that organisation and its men interacted with their society. This thesis firstly analyses the role and place of the mounted soldier in the British and colonial/dominion armies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries before going on to examine what effects the debates about this had on the development of Australia???s mounted troops. It will find that in the nineteenth century the disparate mounted units of the Australian colonies were established mainly along the organisational model of the mounted rifleman. Influenced by social ideas about citizen soldier horsemen and a senior officer with firm views, this model continued to be used by the new Light Horse until well into the First World War. During that war it was gradually discovered that this military model had its limitations and by the end of the war much of the Light Horse had become cavalry. This discovery in turn meant that during the inter-war period cavalry continued to be part of the army. Analysed in depth also are the many organisational changes that affected the mounted branch during its existence. Some of these reflected doctrinal and tactical lessons, and others were the result of various plans by the government and military authorities to improve the army. It will be seen that regardless of these plans part-time citizen horse units continued to have many problems and they rarely came to be what the government wanted of them. That they were as strong as they were was testimony to the efforts of a dedicated and enthusiastic few.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Light Horse</field><field name="subject">Army</field><field name="subject">cavalry</field><field name="subject">World War</field><field name="subject">1914-1918</field><field name="subject">World War One</field><field name="subject">World War 1</field><field name="subject">World War I</field><field name="subject">South African War</field><field name="subject">1899-1902</field><field name="subject">Boer War</field><field name="subject">mounted troops</field><field name="subject">citizen soldiers</field><field name="subject">soldier</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">organization</field><field name="subject">Light Horse Brigade</field><field name="subject">Light Horse Regiment</field><field name="subject">Mounted Rifles</field><field name="subject">Australian military history</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Imperial Force</field><field name="subject">Light Horsemen</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Something peculiar to themselves'? : a social history of the Executive Branch officers of the Royal Australian Navy, 1913-1950</field><field name="creator">Sears, Jason, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In 1985 Richard Preston identified three Royal Navy (RN) traditions (recruitment of officers at an early age, selection of officers from an elite social group, and insistence on sea service) which had shaped the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). These traditions, he argued, ensured a high level of professionalism amongst officers in the infant RCN, as well as complete interoperability between the two navies, but failed to recognise the distinct needs of Canadian society. Consequently, from the Second World War onwards the RCN chose to move away from the British model and to ???Canadianise??? its officer corps.  The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) also adopted these traditions, and they are examined here in the context of the social backgrounds, development and character of the permanent executive branch officers of the RAN between 1913 and 1950. This thesis argues that while the British model ensured a high level of professionalism within the RAN officer corps, in many other areas the system proved to be of doubtful utility for Australia.  Although the Australian government tried to ensure that its naval officers maintained an Australian character and identity, the selection, training and operational policies of the RAN meant that its officers were, to all intents and purposes, virtually indistinguishable from their RN colleagues.  While RAN officers were highly disciplined and professional men with excellent seamanship skills, unfortunately a wide social gulf developed between the Navy???s officers and its sailors. Further, the essentially scientific and practical education and indoctrination that naval officers received in their early years, combined with their narrow professional development, meant that they were, at best, only average higher level administrators and often performed poorly in dealings with their Australian political masters.  The system produced a conservative type of officer, suspicious of political activity and intellectual effort, bound to the tradition of ???the Silent Service???, who felt that his country did not understand his work or sacrifices but who had not the capacity to change such community perceptions. Lacking highly educated and politically aware senior officers, the RAN found it difficult to cope with social changes after the Second World War. Consequently, the ???Australianisation??? of the naval officer corps was a slow and painful process and the profession of naval officer in Australia was to be even more marginal than numbers alone dictated.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Navy</field><field name="subject">RAN</field><field name="subject">officers</field><field name="subject">social life and customs</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">naval education</field><field name="subject">sea service</field><field name="subject">officer/sailor relations</field><field name="subject">discipline and unrest</field><field name="subject">responsibility</field><field name="subject">command</field><field name="subject">promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the performance of different group communication modes : using soft systems methodology to investigate factors</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Gregory John, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has two distinct research threads. One thread examines the effectiveness of technology support on the performance of focus groups. Unlike previous research, the work described in this thesis addresses the fundamental issue that groups are social systems, and that comprehensive measurement of the effectiveness of group activities requires assessment of both the task-oriented and social aspects of the group activity. In this research, four different communication modes are used to compare group effectiveness. The second research thread in this thesis is the use of Systems Thinking, and specifically Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), as the framework for inquiring into the effects of technology support on group effectiveness. The strategy in this thesis for developing and evaluating hypotheses extends the general descriptions and guidance in the literature on using SSM for hypothesis testing. Systems thinking also provides the basis for examining the prevailing ???profile deviation??? view that the better the fit between the group task and the technology support the greater the group performance. Using the six perspectives of fit developed by Venkatraman (1989), the most common GSS models and other models developed to examine Task-Technology Fit (TTF) are analysed. The results show that group performance models are most often tested from a ???profile deviation??? perspective and TTF models developed from a profile deviation perspective claim to have predictive and descriptive validity for assessing the level of group performance. To assess whether an SSM based approach can improve the predictive and/or descriptive analysis of the impact of technology support on group work, a field experiment was conducted at the Australian Defence Force Academy. Twenty focus groups of officer cadets assessed their military training program using a GSS in one of four communication modes. The results showed little predictive or descriptive support for the profile deviation perspective of TTF when measuring the group???s overall effectiveness, task effectiveness, participant satisfaction or group relations. The alternative ???gestalt??? perspective, operationalised in this research by using SSM, provided a more comprehensive approach to examining the effectiveness of technology support for group work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group Support Systems</field><field name="subject">Task-technology fit</field><field name="subject">soft systems methodology</field><field name="subject">systems thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The factors influencing the employment of the Australian Defence Organisation in homeland security roles since 11 September 2001</field><field name="creator">Smith, Andrew, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis makes an assessment of the factors influencing the involvement of the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO) in homeland security roles since 11 September 2001 (9/11).  This is approached on a largely empirical basis, using document analysis and case studies supported with interviews with key individuals and experts.  The thesis commences with an Introduction that provides brief context for the thesis and specifies its central question as ???what factors have shaped the role of the ADO in Australia's response to the homeland security environment that has emerged since 11 September 2001.???  Chapter One provides an historical and theoretical context for the key concepts of homeland security and the challenges confronting Western governments in the homeland security arena.  Chapter Two explores the implications of those challenges for Australia, before outlining the research method and providing a literature review.  Chapter Three is an historical exposition of homeland security in Australia from British settlement in 1788 until 2001.  The Chapter examines events in increasing detail in the 30 years immediately prior to 2001, including a detailed case study of ADO support to the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games, before drawing some broad conclusions on the Australian experience of the involvement of its Defence Organisation in homeland security pre-9/11.  Chapter Four establishes the pre-9/11 status quo in relation to the ADO???s involvement in homeland security role before analysing the general pattern of those roles.  Chapter Five analyses and draws conclusions about the reasons for the ADO???s pre-9/11 involvement in homeland security roles, introducing an hypothetical construct to explain causal factors.  Chapter Six examines the ADO???s involvement in homeland security roles post-9/11, including cases studies of ADO support to the conduct of the 2002 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games.  Chapter Seven analyses and identifies the factors led to the ADO???s pattern of involvement in homeland security post-9/11, further developing the hypothetical construct introduced in Chapter 5.  Chapter Seven also contains supporting case studies on the ADO???s contribution to Australia???s national chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response capability and on the state of New South Wales??? homeland security capabilities.  Chapter Eight draws overall conclusions, including recommendations for Australian policy development and areas for further research.  The essential conclusion reached is that the ADO???s involvement in homeland security roles, both before and since 9/11, has been shaped mostly by pragmatic political and managerial considerations of governments.  Developments have normally occurred in an episodic and incremental fashion in response to ???trigger events,??? although 9/11 altered this pattern somewhat by acting as a ???threshold??? event that re-calibrated demands and expectations for ADO involvement. Supporting Appendices provide detail on the Australian Government???s strategic guidance on ADO involvement in homeland security since 1973; on Australia???s policy for Defence Assistance to the Civilian Community and Defence Force Aid to the Civil Authorities; and on the involvement of former Department of Defence employees in non-Defence homeland-security related roles.

Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.] Indium nitride is an important III-V nitride semiconductor with many potential applications such as in high frequency transistors, laser diodes and photo voltaic cells. The mobility and peak drift velocity of this material are predicted to be extremely high and superior to that of gallium nitride. However, many material properties such as the origin of the n-type conductivity and the electronic band gap are not well understood. Moreover, there is limited information on the stoichiometry and the level of impurity contaminations in the films from different growth techniques.  The n-type conductivity observed for as-grown indium nitride films has long been attributed to nitrogen vacancies, implying that the material is nitrogen deficient. A band gap value around 2 eV, as measured by the optical absorption method, is suggested by some authors to be a result of the formation of an InNIn2O3 alloy. Alternatively, the observation of a lower absorption edge, suggesting a band gap around 0.7 eV, may be caused by Mie scattering at indium clusters that may form during film growth.  Secondary ion mass spectroscopy and x-ray techniques provide only qualitative composition information. The quantitative interpretation of the results relies on calibration samples which are not available for indium nitride. In Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, while quantitative, the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen signals cannot be separated unless the film is very thin ([tilde]150 nm). However, with heavy ion Elastic Recoil Detection (ERD) analysis all the elements in indium nitride films can be fully separated even for a film thickness of [tilde] 800 nm.  In this work, indium nitride films from different growth techniques have been analysed with ERD using 200 MeV 197Au projectiles. The observed nitrogen depletion during the ERD analysis was monitored as a function of projectile fluence using a gas ionisation detector with a large solid angle. Different models have been tested and it has been shown that the bulk molecular recombination model accurately describes the nitrogen depletion so that the original nitrogen-to- indium ratio can be measured with an accuracy of [plus or minus]3 [percent].  The correlation of nitrogen depletion rate and stopping power of the projectile ion has been investigated. The study has shown that the rate of depletion is slower for low-Z projectiles. It has been shown that for a film with good structural properties, no loss of nitrogen occurs during the ERD analysis with low-Z projectiles such as 42 MeV 32S. Thus, the original nitrogen-to-indium ratio can be obtained without any theoretical modelling, and with a precision of better than [plus or minus]1 [percent]. All the indium nitride films studied in this work, for which X-ray diffraction shows no metallic indium, are nitrogen-rich which is contradictory to expectation. Therefore, the common assertion that nitrogen vacancies are the cause of n-type conductivity in as-grown films is diffcult to explain. Instead, the existence of In vacancies, N antisites and interstitial N2 may be speculated. The carbon and oxygen contamination is an issue for films grown by all common growth techniques. However, the suggested correlation of oxygen content in the film with the apparent band gap is not supported by the ERD results. Instead, a correlation between nitrogen-to-indium ratio and the measured band gap has been observed for films grown by RF-sputtering.  This work reports the implantation of radioisotope probes using negative ions. The 111In/Cd probe was selected for this work as it is a common Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) probe and ideally suited for the study of indium nitride. For the synthesis of the probe 111In/Cd, several possibilities, such as the production of 111In/Cd via nuclear fusion evaporation reactions and from commercially available 111InCl3 solutions, were explored. Different materials, including powders of Al2O3 and In2O3, were investigated as a carrier for the probe in the ion source of the radioisotope implanter. It has been established that combining the 111InCl3 solution as the source and In2O3 powder as the carrier material gives optimum implantation efficiency. The radioisotope implanter facility has been developed to a stage that the radioisotope probe 111In/Cd can be routinely implanted into materials as molecular 111InO?? ions. An implantation rate of 3x10 4[th]  Becquerel per hour has been demonstrated. Measurements on different materials (Ag, In, Ni, Si, InP) have shown that condensed matter spectroscopies such as Low Temperature Nuclear Orientation, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance on Oriented Nuclei (NMRON) and Perturbed Angular Correlation can be reliably performed. NMRON measurements on silver indicate a new resonance frequency of 75.08 MHz for 111InAg at 8.0 T.  The local lattice environment of indium nitride thin films has been investigated with PAC spectroscopy. Several methods of introducing a radioisotope probe into a host material have been investigated for indium nitride. The thermal diffusion of the radioisotope probe 111In/Cd into indium nitride at a temperature below the dissociation temperature (about 550 [degrees] C) was not possible. The probe was, however, successfully introduced into indium nitride films with ion implantation techniques. Recoil implantation at MeV energies following fusion evaporation reactions and ion implantation at keV energies, both have been investigated for indium nitride films. An interaction frequency of v = 28 MHz has been measured for the 111In/Cd probe in indium nitride. This result is consistent with that obtained for indium nitride bulk grains. The PAC results suggest that all types of indium nitride films have a highly disordered lattice which could only be partially improved by annealing. Furnace annealing in nitrogen atmosphere above 400 [degrees] C resulted in the dissociation of the film. However, such dissociation could be avoided with rapid thermal annealing up to 600 [degrees] C. More detailed defect studies with PAC require the availability of better material.  This study has also shown that indium nitride is highly sensitive to ion beam irradiation. Severe depletion of nitrogen during exposure to ions with MeV and KeV energies is an issue for the ion beam characterisation and processing of indium nitride.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indium nitride films</field><field name="subject">semiconductor</field><field name="subject">photo voltaic cells</field><field name="subject">laser diodes</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">optical absorption method</field><field name="subject">radioistope</field><field name="subject">negative ions</field><field name="subject">ion</field><field name="subject">elastic recoil detection</field><field name="subject">radiation</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life in the lower deck of the Royal Australian Navy 1911-1952</field><field name="creator">Spurling, Kathryn Lesley, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the development of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), during the period 1911 to 1952 from the perspective of the men of the lower deck, the RAN ratings.  The early RAN was modelled very closely on the Royal Navy (RN), but the expectations of its managers and administrators, imbued as they were with the culture and tradition of the RN, were not easily compatible with the character of the Australians who became the RAN???s ratings. The class distinction which functioned in the RN, when applied to the more egalitarian Australians caused ill-feeling and led to the breakdown of discipline. The Australian Commonwealth Naval Board strongly resisted attempts by the Australian Government and the Australian people to regulate its affairs, a situation which seriously disadvantaged the RAN ratings and their families. In the wider context a continuing refusal by both the British Admiralty and the senior officers of the RAN to allow the development of a truly national navy led to significant manpower problems.

In Australia immigration patterns, geographic features, and a particular historical period combined to create a virulently male dominated society. This was particularly apparent in the armed services. Australia did not allow women to enlist in its defence forces until 1941, a time of unprecedented national peril. Female volunteers were the final option.  The Women???s Services were disbanded following World War II and not re-established until the armed forces again could not fulfil their defence commitment.

The framework is intended to be both rigorous and relevant to the decision-making process. 	Constructivism is adopted as the paradigm guiding the research process of the thesis, after firstly examining also positivist philosophy and ???post-normal??? scientific methodology. The tenets of both ecological and environmental economics are then discussed. An expanded model of human behaviour, which includes facets derived from institutional economics and socioeconomics as well as aspects of neoclassical economics, is outlined. The framework is further developed by considering, from a contractarian view point, the implications of intergenerational equity for biodiversity conservation policies. The issues of intragenerational distribution and allocation are then considered. In this regard, cost-benefit analysis (CBA), as applied to the valuation of forests, PAs, and biodiversity, is critically reviewed. A participatory approach to decision-making, which may also include CBA, is then proposed. 	The resulting ecological economic framework may be thus summarised: (a) ecosystem use patterns should be chosen on the basis of their sustainability, distributional, and efficiency aspects; (b) systems of PAs should be established in order to achieve minimal intergenerational equity; (c) intragenerational equity requires the correction of the asymmetrical distribution of the costs and benefits arising from the establishment of PAs; (d) the institutional features relevant to the environmental-economic issues being analysed should be considered; and (e) the decision-making process should be participatory and action oriented. 	The framework is applied to two case studies in Vanuatu. These applications detail (a) stakeholders??? views and trade-offs faced in relation to forest management (b) modes of participatory research and decision-making, (c) forms of compensation that may be adopted in correcting asymmetrical distributions of the costs and benefits of PAs, and (d) institutional influences on ecosystems use and implications for conservation projects. The institutional arrangements developed for the establishment of the PAs are presented. The application of this ecological economic framework has resulted in the formal establishment of one PA and the identification and assessment of five other PAs.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity. biological diversity</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">constructivism</field><field name="subject">cost-benefit analysis (CBA)</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">deforestation</field><field name="subject">ecological economic framework</field><field name="subject">ecosystem use patterns</field><field name="subject">ecosystems</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">equity</field><field name="subject">Erromango Kauri Protected Area</field><field name="subject">forest management</field><field name="subject">forests</field><field name="subject">intergenerational</field><field name="subject">intragenerational</field><field name="subject">Malekula Island</field><field name="subject">positivism</field><field name="subject">protected areas</field><field name="subject">sandalwood cultivation. sustainability</field><field name="subject">Vanuatu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal conduction in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model</field><field name="creator">Tempatarachoke, Pisut, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">We conduct a comprehensive and systematic study of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) model using both equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, with the aim being to explain the cause of the anomalous energy-transport behaviour in the model.  In the equilibrium scenario, our motivation stems from the lack of a complete understanding of the effects of initial conditions on the energy dissipation among Fourier modes. We also critically reconsider the ????probes' that had been widely used to quantitatively describe the types of energy sharing in a system, and then decide on a preferred choice to be used in our equilibrium study. We establish, from strong numerical evidence, that there exists a critical energy density of approximately 0:1, above which the energy dissipation among the modes becomes independent of initial conditions and system parameters, and that the full equipartition of mode energy is never attained in the FPU model. We report, for the first time, the violation of particle positions in the FPU model at high energies, where the particles are found to pass through one another.  In the non-equilibrium scenario, we critically review the Nos???Se-Hoover algorithm thermostatting method largely used by other works, and identify its weaknesses. We also review some other alternative methods and decide on the most appropriate one to be implemented throughout our work. We confirm the divergence of the thermal conductivity of the FPU model as the chain length increases, and that kfpu [symbol] No.41, in agreement with other works. Our study further shows that there exists an upper limit of the anharmonicity in the FPU model, and that any attempt to increase the strength of this anharmonicity will not succeed. We also introduce elastic collisions into the original FPU model and find that the Modified  model (FPUC) still exhibits anomalous thermal conductivity. We conclude that a one-dimensional FPU-type model with ????only' nearest-neighbour interaction, regardless of being soft or hard, does not exhibit a finite thermal conductivity as the system size increases, due to the non-chaotic nature of its microscopic dynamics, the origin of which we are unable to account for.

However, these drives sometimes produce unacceptably high levels in vibration and acoustic noise. A literature survey has revealed that while there has been intensive research on the design of inverters to minimize acoustic noise radiation from these drives, the vibro-acoustic behaviour of an induction motor structure has received relatively little attention. The primary objective of this research project, therefore, is to develop a general strategy/algorithm for estimating the acoustic noise radiated from inverter-driven induction motors.  By using a three-phase, 2.2 kW induction motor, the vibration modes due to various structural components (such as the rotor, the stator/casing, the endshields and the base plate) of the motor structure were analysed by experimental modal testing. Results indicate that the vibration modes due to the rotor are only important at low frequencies. It has been found that the power injection method gives more accurate measurement of the damping of a motor structure than the modal testing and the time decay methods. If a point force excitation is used, then it is more accurate to measure the sound radiation efficiency than the power conversion efficiency for motor structures.  The effect of three different inverter designs (an ideal ???almost sinusoidal??? controller and two commercially available PWM inverters) on the radiated acoustic power were assessed for both no-load and load conditions using sound intensity measurements conducted in an anechoic room. The results indicate that although the sound power level due to aerodynamic and mechanical noise increases at a rate of 12 dB per doubling of the motor speed, the electromagnetic noise dominates at low motor speeds and is still a significant noise source even at high motor speeds. For inverters with low switching frequencies, the radiated sound power level is almost 15 dB higher than the ideal case at low speeds and is relatively insensitive to the motor speed. For inverters that implement the random modulation technique, the change in the total sound power level with the level of the random modulation is very small but the tonal nature of the noise is greatly reduced.  The vibration behaviour of a motor structure was modeled using the finite element method (FEM) and validated using the experimental modal testing results. It has been found that it is essential to model the laminated stator as an orthotropic structure. While the details of other structural components (such as the endshields, the teeth in the stator and the windings) are not so important, it is essential that they are incorporated into the structural model as simplified structures to account for their mass, stiffness and boundary conditions imposed on the motor structure. Based on this structural model, the radiated acoustic power for various operating conditions has been predicated using the boundary element (BEM) and the electromagnetic force calculated from an electromagnetic finite element model. The predicted results agree reasonably well with experimental measurements.  Despite the success of the FEM/BEM approaches, they can be prohibitively expensive (in terms of computer resources required) to apply to large motors and high frequencies. Thus the feasibility of using a statistical method, namely, the statistical energy analysis (SEA), to estimate the radiated acoustic sound power from an inverter-driven induction motor has been examined. In order to carry out this analysis, analytical expressions for calculating the natural frequencies and radiation efficiency of finite length circular cylindrical shells (which are simplified models of the stator and casing of a motor structure) were firstly derived. The internal loss factors and coupling loss factors of the motor structure were determined experimentally using the power injection method. Then by introducing an equivalent surface mobility of circular cylindrical shells for the electromagnetic force, the vibration response and the acoustic noise radiated from each part of the motor structure were estimated. Results indicate that SEA method is potentially an efficient and effective tool in estimating the noise radiated from inverter-driven induction motors.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibro-acoustic analysis</field><field name="subject">induction motor</field><field name="subject">inverters</field><field name="subject">motor structure</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic noise</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">finite element method</field><field name="subject">boundary element method</field><field name="subject">statistical energy analysis</field><field name="subject">finite length cylindrical shells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling of collection strategies for end-of-life products using coloured Petri Net</field><field name="creator">Hanafi, Jessica, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Currently various collection strategies are implemented in different parts of the world to collect End-of-Life (EOL) products. These strategies are specific to certain conditions in a particular region, involving different parties such as Original Equipment Manufacturers, Government or Councils, Recyclers, and the community. Since different collectors in the reverse logistics network will influence its performance, a suitable collection program is required. The objective of this research is to find an optimum collection strategy to suit various environments by considering the costs and the environmental aspects of collection. To design optimum collection strategies, information on the rate of EOL product returns is essential. Therefore, a methodology is proposed to forecast the return of EOL products by considering product life, consumer behavior and historical sales. This forecast model is then integrated into the collection strategy model. The integrated model is dynamically formulated to present the behavior of different sets of strategies. Colored Petri Net (CPN) approach is utilized in the forecasting and modeling of collection strategies. The distinct characteristic of CPN provides the ability to model uncertainties in a system. Some case studies were conducted in Australia to verify and to validate the models. The results indicate that the integrated model will help practitioners in making decisions on implementing a suitable collection strategy for Reverse Logistics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Logistics technology transfer model</field><field name="creator">Al Hajri, Abdullah Said, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A consecutive number of studies on the adoption trend of logistics technology since 1988 revealed that logistics organizations are not in the frontier when it comes to adopting new technology and this delayed adoption creates an information gap. In the advent of supply chain management and the strategic position of logistics, the need for accurate and timely information to accompany the logistics executives became more important than ever before. Given the integrative nature of logistics technology, failure to implement the technology successfully could result in writing off major investments in developing and implementing the technology or even in abandoning the strategic initiatives underpinned by these innovations. Consequently, the need to employ effective strategies and models to cope with these uncertainties is rather crucial. This thesis addresses the aspect of uncertainty in implementation success by process and factor research models. Process research approach focuses on the sequence of events in the technology transfer process that occurs over time. It explains the story that explains the degree of association between these sequences and implementation success. Through content analysis, this research gathers, extracts, and categorizes process data of actual stories of logistics technology adoption and implementations in organizations that are published in literature. The extracted event sequences are then analyzed using optimal matching from natural science and grouped using cluster analysis. Four patterns were revealed that organizations follow to transfer logistics technology namely, formal minimalist, mutual adaptation, development concerned, and organizational roles dispenser. Factors that contribute to successful implementation in each pattern were defined as the crucial and necessary events that characterized and differentiated each pattern from others. The factor approach identifies the potential predictors of successful technology implementation and tests empirical association between predictors and outcomes. This research develops a logistics technology success model. In developing the model, various streams of research were investigated including logistics, information systems, and organizational psychology. The model is tested using a questionnaire survey study. The data were collected from Australian companies which have recently adopted and implemented logistics technology. The results of a partial least squares structured equation modeling provide strong support for the model constructs and valuable insights to logistics/supply chain managers. The last study reports a convergent triangulation study using multiple case study of three Australian companies which have implemented logistics technology. A within and a cross case analysis of the three cases provide cross validation for the results of the other two studies. The results provided high predictive validity for the two models. Furthermore, the case study approach was so beneficial in explaining and contextualizing the linkages of the factor-based model and in confirming the importance of the crucial events in the process-based model. The thesis concludes with a research and managerial implications chapter which is devoted for logistics/supply chain managers and researchers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Process model</field><field name="subject">Logistics</field><field name="subject">Technology Transfer</field><field name="subject">Variance model</field><field name="subject">Optimal matching</field><field name="subject">Triangulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microtransfusion and viral exposure in infants born to HIV-infected women</field><field name="creator">Warning, Julia Carolyn, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Mechanisms facilitating mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV have not been elucidated. Small quantities of blood pass from mother to infant during childbirth, termed 'microtransfusion'; this is one possible mechanism for HIV entry into the infant's circulation. HIV-specific cellular immune responses have been detected in some uninfected infants born to HIV-infected women, indicating transient virus exposure or replication in these infants. Both microtransfusion and HIV-specific immune responses in infants born to HIV-infected women has not previously been investigated. Methods: 46 uninfected infants born to HIV-infected women were included in this study. Infants were grouped according to interventions utilised by the mother: none or antiretroviral therapy (ART; group A, n = 16), ART with elective caesarean section (elCS; group B, n = 12), highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) only (group C, n = 7), and HAART with elCS (group D, n = 11). HLA-A and -B alleles were typed for all mother-baby pairs to identify the non-inherited maternal allele (NIMA). Microtransfusion was detected using flow cytometry or by qPCR targeting the NIMA. HIV-specific immune responses were detected using 51Cr-release and IFN-?????? ELISpot assays. Results: Microtransfusion was detected in umbilical cord blood of 9 of 11 infants, and in peripheral blood of 4 of 11 infants up to 1 week old. One infant without detectable microtransfusion in umbilical cord blood had detectable maternal cells in peripheral blood. 8/46 infants had HIV-specific T cell responses, 5 were in group A, 2 in group B, and 1 in group C, while no infants in group D had detectable responses (p = 0.04). Blood samples from 2 of these 8 infants were also available for the analysis of microtransfusion. Microtransfused maternal cells were present in the umbilical cord blood of both infants. Conclusion: In this study, the number of infants with HIV-specific immune responses decreased with the use of MTCT interventions, indicating reduced exposure to HIV in these infants. This is the first study to demonstrate both microtransfusion and HIV-specific immune responses in uninfected infants. Microtransfusion may facilitate viral exposure, resulting in the development of potentially protective immune responses in infants born to HIV-infected women.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EUI</field><field name="subject">Microtransfusion</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">Mother-to-child transmission</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pair-Design: an empirical perspective. The effects of Pair-Design on the quality of products and the efficiency and productivity of the process.</field><field name="creator">Al-Kilidar, Hiyam, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">As competition for sophisticated software innovations continues to escalate, so does the need to develop better quality products through efficient and productive processes. Delivering design-products of high quality standards is crucial to improve the quality of the final product and the efficiency of the whole development process. There is empirical evidence to support improving quality of code by utilising pair programming. Nevertheless, mixed findings about the efficiency and productivity of the pair programming process are also reported. Literature asserts that the early detection and fixing of errors and faults will contribute to a more efficient and productive development lifecycle. However, empirical studies of the application of the Pair-Work techniques into earlier phases of the development lifecycle such as the design phase have not been adequately investigated. Conducting empirical research to evaluate the quality of design-products is challenging. The difficulty is not only associated with the precise identification of quality attributes and measures of design products, but also in how to extract such information from the many different design styles. The research reported in this thesis provides details of an empirical study that evaluated quality of design artefacts as well as the efficiency and productivity of the design-process of pair and solo designers. An experimentation program was designed and conducted with 175 student subjects. The experimental program investigated 3 main research questions: (1) Does the Pair-design process have an effect on the quality of designs when compared to solo-design process? (2) Does the pair design process affect the efficiency and productivity of the design process when compared with solo design process? (3) What factors affected the experience and practices of partners in the pair-design process? The findings showed that when compared with solo designing, the Pair-Design process positively affected the quality of the design-products. Other findings showed that the when measured in person-hours, the efficiency of the Pair-Design process was less than that of the solo- design process. However, when measured in hours of elapsed time, the pair design process was largely more efficient than the solo design process. The pair design process positively affected the productivity of the design process compared to the solo design process. It was also shown that pair design improved design performance of partners when they subsequently designed as solos. Partners also reported having a better learning experience, more confidence in their output products, better sense of achievement and a more enjoyable experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hydrodynamics of high-speed transom-stern vessels</field><field name="creator">Robards, Simon William, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the design of all marine craft the prediction of a vessel??s resistance characteristics is a major consideration. The accurate prediction of resistance is particularly important in the design of modern high-speed vessels where the primary contractual obligation placed upon the builder is the vessel??s achievable speed. Investigation was made of the methods of Doctors and Day, whereby the traditional Michell wave-resistance theory, published in 1898, is improved on through a better understanding of the hydrodynamics of transom sterns and the application of statistically determined form factors. One of the difficulties with the Michell theory is how to account for the hollow that forms behind a transom stern, a feature prevalent in high-speed vessels. A common approach in the numerical prediction of wave resistance for transom-stern vessels is to discretize the hollow as a geometrically-smooth addition to the vessel. Therefore, of great importance in accurate prediction of wave resistance is the hydrodynamics of, and in particular, the length and depth of the hollow formed behind the transom stern. Accordingly, a systematic series of transom-stern models were tank tested at various drafts and speeds in order to determine experimentally the length and depth of the hollow as a function of vessel speed, draft and beam. From the experimental data, algorithms for the determination of the length and depth of the transom hollow, have been developed and utilised in the discretization of the transom hollow for prediction of resistance using the Michell wave- resistance theory. Application of the developed hollow algorithms produced significant improvements in correlation of the experimental and theoretical predictions of total resistance, particularly in the lower Froude range. In addition to the transom-hollow investigation, form factors were obtained using least-squares regression of existing experimental data. The form factors were based on the major geometric parameters of the models used. In the research presented here, the method was applied to a large range of published resistance data for high-speed displacement vessels. Considerable improvement in correlation, between theoretical and experimental predictions of total resistance, was obtained by incorporating the calculated form-factors into the total resistance formulation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Transom-stern</field><field name="subject">Form factors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invasive alien species and the protection of biodiversity: the role of quarantine laws in resolving inadequacies in the international legal regime</field><field name="creator">Riley, Sophie, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem of invasive alien species (IAS) is recognized as the second most serious threat to loss of biodiversity after habitat destruction. It is a problem largely created by humans as they transport and introduce species, deliberately and accidentally, from one part of the globe to another. The pressures exerted on biodiversity by international trade are one of the most serious aspects of the IAS problem. Although states are under obligations in international environmental law to prevent the entry of, and control, those alien species that threaten biodiversity, to date state practice has often been found wanting. In particular, quarantine regulation, which can be a state??s first line of defence against IAS, is mainly used by states to protect their farming and agricultural product sectors rather than biodiversity at large. The reasons for this include lack of domestic resources and lack of guidance at the international level. However, even if states were to expand the purview of quarantine, the question arises whether they would be able to use quarantine regulation to protect biodiversity from IAS while simultaneously fulfilling their international trade law obligations. This study seeks to answer this question by examining international environmental law and international trade law in their application to quarantine regulation. In doing so, the study identifies many areas of conflict. The different policies that underpin environmental and trade regimes mean that environmental concepts, such as the precautionary principle and the ecosystem approach, are difficult to apply within the international trade law regime. A way of achieving a more harmonized international response to the problem of IAS is suggested by incorporating environmental considerations into the international standards used by states to design and implement domestic quarantine measures. To facilitate the practical implementation of international standards the study further recommends appropriate financial and institutional capacity building mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SPS Agreement</field><field name="subject">Invasive Alien Species</field><field name="subject">Quarantine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of social change in Saharawi refugee camps: democracy, education and   women??s rights</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Karen, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Refugee studies often focus on the devastating effects forced migration can have on a refugee population, both mentally and physically. This research investigates the case of Saharawis living in refugee camps in south-west Algeria and the social change experienced over 30 years. The method was a case study with qualitative interviews supported with secondary data. The Saharawis went through a period of positive social change, to some a revolution, while living in the refugee camps. The empirical study identifies three theme areas; Education, Women??s rights and Democracy.  These circumstances are unlike many other refugee studies, thus providing what may be a unique case of positive social change. The case demonstrates how forced migration of a population may not just be a destructive process, but instead has the potential to reconstruct a society. Theories of social change and unanticipated outcomes are explored. Utilising the theories of Bourdieu and Merton, it is proposed that the Saharawi refugee experience is the unanticipated outcome of forced migration. This thesis explores commonalities and differences between Bourdieu??s study of the Kabyle population, and whether his theory of habitus is applicable. Bourdieu??s theories, heavily criticised for being too structuralist, show their limitations when dealing with positive social change. Bourdieu??s approach can suggest that it is inevitable for refugee populations to spiral into despair. The Saharawi case challenges these presumptions and highlights that neither sociologists nor populations should exclude the possibility of unexpected outcomes. Unanticipated outcomes are an acknowledgement of social change and the fact that at its heart no one can predict the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugee</field><field name="subject">Saharawi</field><field name="subject">Sahrawi</field><field name="subject">Social change</field><field name="subject">Bourdieu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The writing on the wall: language, colonialism and the war on terror</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Barnaby, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">??The real Great Wall of China is Chinese characters.?? My Chinese teacher said this in an off-hand way during my first Chinese lesson. Learning to read and write in Chinese is an extremely daunting task for a westerner, but the effort can open the door to an understanding of the culture like no other. My work is concerned with the notions of cultural barriers, misunderstandings and misinterpretations. I enjoy the difficulties in communication that happen as a regular part of life and I hope to reflect this in my work. Language is a large part of identity. In Australia, for example, mateship, as a linguistic expression of a cultural concept, carries a huge weight of authority. As a concept mateship developed amid racial tension on the gold fields of the mid 1800s, evolved among the diggers in the trenches of Gallipoli and the Western front, and it flourishes today as part of modern Australia. As Australians, our war-time history and the language and ideology of that history form a big part of our identity and so influence the cultural assumptions we make. Through my art I try to be a voice pointing out the unquestioning acceptance of cultural assumptions. I rely heavily on elements reflecting childhood, toys and games. Like many people I became interested in art through toys and childhood play. Constructing model war planes was how I learned to create. The irony of learning to create through violent and destructive images and the sense of fun inherent in the toys that I use are very important in my art. Not only do the toys contribute playfulness and accessibility, but it contrasts disturbingly with the darker side of globalisation and colonialism, be it the old style colonialism of the world of Tintin or the neo-colonialism depicted in the War on Terror.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic investigation of relevant predictors, moderations and mediations for intention to speed, drink-drive, drive while fatigued, and not wear a seat belt, amongst young NSW drivers</field><field name="creator">Fernandes, Ralston, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Road trauma is recognized as a major public health problem worldwide (particularly for younger drivers), and risky driving has been identified as an important contributor to road crashes. It is often assumed that similar factors influence all risky driving behaviours, although direct and systematic examination of the differences between risky driving behaviours in terms of precipitating factors is lacking. The present thesis sought to undertake a systematic investigation of relevant factors in the prediction of four key risky driving behaviours (speeding, drink-driving, driving while fatigued, and not wearing seat belts).  Four versions of a Risky Driving Questionnaire were developed to assess beliefs, personality factors and behavioural intentions, in relation to each of the four behaviours. Four versions of the Implicit Association Test were developed to assess attitudes toward each of the four behaviours, without reliance on self-report (in terms of the relative strength of pairs of associations). Data were collected from a student sample (N=215: Study 1), as well as urban (N=587) and rural (N=422) general population samples (Study 2), and regression models were examined for each of the four behaviours, with interaction terms to assess moderations involving perceived risk. Mediations involving gender were also assessed.  Results indicate that different risky driving behaviours are predicted by different factors. For example, in the urban sample, speeding was predicted by driver anger and illusory invulnerability, drink driving was predicted by peer influence, driving while fatigued was predicted by the perceived benefits of not driving while fatigued, and not wearing seat belts was predicted by the (sensation seeking x illusory invulnerability) interaction. Results also suggest that different predictors of risky driving behaviours are relevant for different driver populations. For example, speeding was predicted by authority rebellion in the urban sample, and by sensation seeking in the rural sample. Observed moderations of perceived risk suggest that relationships between perceived risk and risky driving may differ for males versus females, and for low versus high sensation seekers. Findings suggest that future road safety interventions should be based on research of the determinants of individual risky driving behaviours, and in specific driver populations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young Drivers</field><field name="subject">Risky Driving</field><field name="subject">Perceived Risk</field><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early detection of blood loss using a noninvasive finger photoplethysmographic pulse oximetry waveform</field><field name="creator">Chan, Gregory, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Delayed control of haemorrhage or blood loss has been recognised as a major contributor to preventable trauma deaths, but early detection of internal bleeding is difficult due to unreliability of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) as markers of volume status. This thesis explores a novel method of early blood loss detection using a noninvasive finger photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulse oximetry waveform that is normally utilised in pulse oximeters for estimating arterial oxygen saturation.  Graded head-up tilt (n = 13) and blood donation (n = 43) in human volunteers were selected as experimental models of mild to moderate blood loss. From the tilt study, a novel method for automatically detecting left ventricular ejection time (LVET) from the finger PPG waveform has been developed and verified by comparison with the LVET measured from aortic flow velocity. PPG waveform derived LVET (LVETp) and pulse transit time (PTT) were strongly correlated with aortic LVET and pre-ejection period respectively (median r = 0.954 and 0.964) and with the decrease in central blood volume indicated by the sine of the tilt angle (median r = -0.985 and 0.938), outperforming R-R interval (RRI) and BP in detecting mild central hypovolaemia. In the blood donation study, progressive blood loss was characterised by falling LVETp and rising PTT (p &lt; 0.01). A new way of identifying haemorrhagic phases by monitoring changes and trends in LVETp, PTT and RRI has been proposed based on the results from the two studies.  The utility of frequency spectrum analysis of PPG waveform variability (PPGV) in characterising blood loss has also been examined. A new technique of PPGV analysis by computing the coherence-weighted cross-spectrum has been proposed. It has been shown that the spectral measures of finger PPGV exhibited significant changes (p &lt; 0.01) with blood donation and were mildly correlated with systemic vascular resistance in intensive care unit patients (r from 0.53 to 0.59, p &lt; 0.0001), therefore may be useful for identification of different haemorrhagic phases.  In conclusion, this thesis has established finger PPG waveform as a potentially useful noninvasive tool for early detection of blood loss.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">Haemorrhage</field><field name="subject">Arterial pulse</field><field name="subject">Photoplethysmography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land Mark Architecture - in an age of non-discovery</field><field name="creator">Glover, Richard John, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this MFA Research Documentation is to present the ideas behind the photographs produced during the MFA Degree.

For membrane processes to deliver their desired performances and mitigate the effect of disturbances, automatic controllers must be installed.  Before the installation of controllers, operability analysis is a crucial step to evaluate how well the processes can be controlled, and to determine how process design can be improved for better control. However, existing applications of operability analysis in membrane processes are limited.  This thesis extends the application of operability analysis to a multiple-stage membrane process, exemplified by a detailed case study of a 12-stage industrial whey ultrafiltration (UF) process.   Process dynamic models are determined to describe the transient behaviour of process performance caused by disturbances and long-term fouling. Steady-state nonlinear operability analysis is conducted to identify inherent limitations of the process. Using the process dynamic models, dynamic operability analysis is performed to determine the effects of dynamic behaviour on process and controller design.  Steady-state operability analysis shows that the whey UF process is not able to mitigate the effects of high concentrations of true protein in the fresh whey feed.  The ability of the process to mitigate the effects of disturbances is also adversely affected by long-term membrane fouling.  Mid-run washing is therefore necessary to restore control performance after long periods of operation.  Besides demonstrating the adverse effects of long-term membrane fouling on operability, dynamic operability analysis identifies the manipulated variables that can deliver the best control performance. It also indicates that control performance can be improved by installing equipment (e.g. buffer tanks) upstream of the process.  Dynamic operability analysis shows that recycling of the retentate stream has a profound effect on the plant-wide dynamics and reduces significantly the achievable speed of process response under automatic control.  However, retentate recycling is essential during operation to minimize membrane fouling. Although reducing the number of stages in the whey UF process can improve the achievable speed of process response under automatic control, process performance will fluctuate significantly from its desired level. A trade-off therefore exists between process performance and control performance that should be addressed during process and controller design.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operability</field><field name="subject">Multiple-stage processes</field><field name="subject">Whey ultrafiltration</field><field name="subject">Automatic control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification, elimination and reduction of barriers to the effective use of respiratory personal protective equipment</field><field name="creator">Wallaart, Johannes Christiaan, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the identification, elimination and reduction of barriers to the use of personal respiratory protective equipment (RPE) in the workplace to reduce and prevent occupational inhalation disease.  Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) is widely used in industry, health, emergency response, military settings and many other applications and are in daily use by thousands of people in Australasia.   The equipment is generally used to filter or ab/adsorb the contaminants from the air prior to delivery to the wearer by filtering or ad/absorbing contaminants from the air prior to being breathed.  There is increasing concerns being expressed worldwide as well as in Australia and New Zealand about the apparent increase in diagnosed occupational diseases and the use of RPE is an essential preventative measure able to be adopted by workplaces.  The use of this type of equipment is the option after the preferred options of elimination and isolation of the individual from the contaminant in the atmosphere.  In spite of this, many different types of RPE are routinely in use.    There are, however, enormous practical, physiological and psychological difficulties in the wearing of RPE.  Concerns have been expressed in the literature as well as in practical situations that many different types of RPE was unable to meet the needs of workers, particularly as related to airflows and that current standards did not reflect the real-life workplace demands.  This work set out to determine an improved methodology for users to determine the total inward leakage (TIL), the different types and quantities of airflows, particularly Peak Inspiratory Air Flows (PIAF).  When communicating (an essential aspect in the workplace for safety reasons), PIAFs rise dramatically.  This work showed that PIAF were very high, particularly when communicating, and is likely to exceed the ability of many commercial types of commercially available respiratory equipment as well being in excess of the  certification requirements of standard bodies.  In addition, Minute Volumes (MV) in a typical Australian workforce were shown to be very variable between individuals and current certification requirement of airflows do not appear to reflect practical use.  The thesis further investigated using a questionnaire survey, the knowledge and current intervention measures adopted by farmers in different sections of agriculture, particularly dairy farming.  Agriculture in New Zealand is a critical economic activity, employing 10% of the total workforce.  This work showed that in spite of many different types of intervention activity spread over many years by Government agencies and private organisations to date, limited awareness exists of inhalation diseases and appropriate types of RPE in different applications (for example, confined space applications).  The research would suggest that a different and more intensive approach is needed by Government agencies to address the problem in this workplace community if workplace inhalation diseases are to be reduced in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PPE</field><field name="subject">Respirator</field><field name="subject">Airflows</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reassembling scholarly publishing: open access, institutional repositories and the process of change</field><field name="creator">Kennan, Mary Anne, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Open access (OA) to scholarly publishing is encouraged and enabled by new technologies such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, their standards and protocols, and search engines.  Institutional repositories (IR) as the most recent technological incarnations of OA enable researchers and their institutions to make accessible the outputs of research. While many OA repositories are being implemented, researchers are surprisingly slow in adopting them. While activists promote OA as emanating from the ideals of scholarship, others revile OA as undermining of scholarly publishing's economic base and therefore undermining quality control and peer review.   Change is occurring but there are contested views and actions. This research seeks to increase understanding of the issues by addressing the research questions: "How and why is open access reassembling scholarly publishing?" and "What role does introducing an open access institutional repository to researchers play in this reassembly?"  This thesis contributes to answering these questions by investigating two IR implementations and the research communities they serve. The research was conducted as an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) field study, where the actors were followed and their relations and controversies explored in action as their landscape was being contested.  The research found that central to our understanding of the reassembling of scholarly publishing is the agency emerging from the sociomaterial relations of the OA vision, IR technology and researchers.  Being congruent with the aims of scholarship, and also being flexible and mutable, the OA vision enrols researchers to enact it through OA IR, thus transforming scholarly communications. This is counteracted by publishers aligned with the academic reward network within traditional publishing networks. In this delicate choreography the OA IR, its developers, researchers, university administrators and policy makers are merging as critical actors with their more or less congruent vision of OA enacted in their network. The comparative ANT account of the two IR life stories shows how such enactment depends on the degree to which different OA visions could converge, enrol and mobilise other actors, in particular institutional actors, such as a mandate, in transforming researchers' publishing behaviour. This thesis contributes to a novel and in-depth understanding of OA and IR and their roles in reassembling scholarly publishing. It also contributes to the use of ANT in information systems research by advancing a sociomaterial ontology which recognises the intertwining of human and material agency.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Institutional repositories.</field><field name="subject">Scholarly publishing.</field><field name="subject">Open access.</field><field name="subject">Actor network theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies into global asset allocation strategies using the markov-switching model</field><field name="creator">Emery, Martin, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the potential opportunities of global asset allocation and the possible enhancement of these opportunities from using a Markov Switching Model.  The thesis extends upon previous conditional asset pricing studies in global asset allocation, such as those done by Ilamnen (1995), Harvey, Solnik and Zhou (1992) and Bilson (1993), where expected future returns are forecast based on conditional variables.  The finding of these studies, and many others, are combined with the works on Markov Switching models and market segmentation theories to create a uniform structure for analysing regime switching properties in currencies, international equities and international bond markets.  This thesis is segregated into 4 major sections.  The chapters 1-4 develop a unified framework that is used in the analysis of markets.  The chapters 5-7 are focused on currencies, international equities and international bonds.  For each market a model is constructed that is based upon the structure proposed by Frankel and Froot (1988).  In this model the market is segmented into two groups ?? value based investors and momentum based investors.  To replicate this structure, a two regime Markov Switching model is used, where one regime is constructed as a value regime and the second is constructed as a momentum regime.  These models are then compared to linear versions of the models, to see whether there is any additional benefit to the application of regime switching methods.  In conjunction with testing the potential benefits of the Markov Regime Switching process, this study also investigates the very nature, or characteristics of regime switching in the international markets.  This is undertaken though some alternate models and enhancements to see whether there is any predictability, or characterisations can be made of the switching process.  To ensure a comprehensive analysis, several analytical methods have been used, including extensive econometric modelling, statistical analysis of forecasts and portfolio back testing.  A number of conclusions can be drawn from the results.  Firstly it appears that there is substantial evidence of regime switching in international markets, such as that shown in a Frankel-Froot framework.  This in turn has major implication for the understanding of the way in which international markets function, and further the empirical evidence supports many of the anecdotal observations of market based participants.  Secondly, there appears to be a strong level of economic relevance to the modelling.  The models are shown to generate a theoretical economic profit, which shows that the international markets are only semi efficient.  Further, forecasts generated from the Markov Switching models outperform the linear counterparts in economic significance in portfolio tests.  However, for both equities and bonds, the general accuracy of the forecast tends to be inferior to the linear counterparts.  Finally, the nature of regime switching is investigated in detail, particularly in reference to 3 potential drivers ?? greed, fear and success.  The evidence shows that these can help explain the characteristics of regime switching, as in some cases potentially adding economic value.  However, it seems that success is more important than a broader economic environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asset Allocation</field><field name="subject">Markov Switching</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of merging and environment on galaxies and clusters of galaxies</field><field name="creator">Owers, Matthew Scott, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses two fundamental questions in astrophysics: (i) To what extent is environment a driver of galaxy evolution? And (ii) How does hierarchical structure formation affect the galaxy environment? The former is addressed by examining the environments of starburst galaxies, the latter by examining clusters undergoing major mergers with focus placed on the efficacy of ??cold fronts?? in identifying systems that have recently undergone a major merger - an essential first step to understanding their impact.  For the first of these studies, the 2dFGRS was exploited to select large samples of starburst galaxies. These were used to derive measurements of the local and large-scale environments, clustering properties, and morphologies of starburst galaxies. It is found local environment is most germane in terms of a starburst triggering mechanism, with the starburst galaxies showing an excess of close (&lt;20 kpc) neighbours with comparable luminosity/mass, while 20-30% exhibit a morphology consistent with them being involved in an ongoing tidal/merger interaction. On large scales (5-15 Mpc), the starburst galaxies were found to be much less clustered compared to the overall 2dFGRS population, and were not preferentially found in rich clusters with just over half residing in low to intermediate luminosity groups. However, in a number of cases, evidence for obvious local environmental influences was lacking, indicating starbursts can also be internally driven.  For the latter study, the Chandra, archive was used to select a sample of clusters exhibiting ??cold front?? features. Selection required the presence of significant density jumps (&gt;1.5 at the lower 90% CI) in the intracluster medium and for the gas on the denser side of the front to be cooler. From this sample, the clusters Abell 1201, Abell 2163, RXJ1720.1+2638, and Abell 3667 were targeted for comprehensive spectroscopic follow-up at optical wavelengths using the 3.9m Anglo Australian and 6.5m Multiple Mirror Telescopes. Using 321 spectroscopically confirmed members for Abell 1201, 550 for Abell 3667 and 491 for Abell 2163 it is shown that these clusters contain substructure which can be directly related to the cold fronts, whilst for 335 confirmed members in RXJ1720.1+2638 promising evidence exists for merger activity related to the cold front. Despite the range of different types of cold fronts and substructures detected, it is clear that cold fronts are robust signposts of merger activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">galaxies</field><field name="subject">clusters of galaxies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating astrobiology in public: A study of scientific literacy</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Carol Ann, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The majority of adults in the US and in Europe appear to be scientifically illiterate. This has not changed in more than half a century. It is unknown whether the Australian public is also scientifically illiterate because no similar testing is done here. Public scientific illiteracy remains in spite of improvements in science education, innovative approaches to public outreach, the encouraging of science communication via the mass media, and the advent of the Internet. Why is it that there has been so little change? Is school science education inadequate? Does something happen between leaving high school education and becoming an adult? Does Australia suffer from the same apparent malady?  The pilot study at the heart of this thesis tests a total of 692 Year Ten (16-year-old) Australian students across ten high schools and a first year university class in 2005 and 2006, using measures applied to adults. Twenty-six percent of those tested participated in a related scientific literacy project utilising in-person visits to Macquarie University in both years. A small group of the students (64) tested in 2005 were considered the best science students in seven of the ten high schools. Results indicate that no more than 20% of even the best high school science students - on the point of being able to end their formal science education - are scientifically literate if measured by adult standards. Another pilot test among 150 first year university students supports that indication. This compares to a scientific literacy rate of 28% for the US public.  This thesis finds that the scientific literacy enterprise ?? in all its forms ?? fails scrutiny.  Either we believe our best science students are leaving high school scientifically illiterate or there is something fundamentally wrong in our perceptions of public scientific illiteracy. This pilot study ?? probably the first of its kind ?? indicates we cannot rely on our current perceptions of a scientifically illiterate public. It demonstrates that a paradigm shift in our thinking is required about what scientific literacy is and in our expectations of a scientifically literate adult public.  In the worst case scenario, governments are pouring millions of dollars into science education and public outreach with little or no basis for understanding whether either is effective. That is illogical, even irresponsible. It also impacts on the way astrobiology ?? or any science ?? is communicated in public.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">astrobiology</field><field name="subject">scientific literacy</field><field name="subject">public understanding of science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The governance of AIDS in China: assessing the impact of global norms</field><field name="creator">Hague, Rowan, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents the development of the Chinese government??s response to HIV/AIDS in the context of the global AIDS regime in order to assess when, how and to what extent international AIDS norms have had an impact upon China??s governance of AIDS. Employing an applied constructivist framework, the thesis argues that the impact of global norms at the domestic level has been contingent on a) the socializing actions of norm entrepreneurs, b) the domestic political context and c) crisis. In the case of China and the impact of global AIDS norms, the central argument is that key elements of China??s domestic political context minimized the socializing affects of the global AIDS regime until the SARS crisis in 2003 led to a reappraisal of AIDS in the context of political legitimacy, at which time global AIDS norms began to have increasing salience in China. This thesis begins by identifying the evolution of a global AIDS regime before moving on to an exploration of China??s domestic political context. The thesis then documents and analyses China??s governance of AIDS from 1985 to 2007 through the use of five indicators ?? political commitment, legislation and policy, representation of AIDS in the media, the participation of civil society, and international engagement. The findings demonstrate that there has been a significant change between China??s pre-SARS and post-SARS AIDS governance with China acting increasingly in accordance with global norms following the SARS crisis of 2003. The thesis proposes that the SARS crisis was catalytic in that it exposed the vulnerability of the Chinese government??s claims to legitimacy, and in so doing, enabled the domestic political context to shift, allowing health, and by extension AIDS, to be reframed as a political issue. Importantly however, when the Chinese government scaled up its response to the epidemic it was able to be guided by the normative framework prescribed by the global AIDS regime.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constructivism</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">global norms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transformation in direct private share ownership in Australia: Embourgeoisement? Democracy?</field><field name="creator">Ivancic, Antonny John, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The increase in direct personal investment in capital market assets by Australians over the past two decades represents an unprecedented engagement with that sector of Australian economic life. This dissertation critically investigates claims that this engagement heralds a shareholder democracy. Increased economic participation based on private direct ownership of corporate securities could be interpreted as a weak form of democratisation. Using a class-theoretical framework, the dissertation conceptualises the private shareholder phenomenon as a process of embourgeoisement and argues that the development of a macro-level mass consumer financial products market is the result of capitalist class development and expansion. A thesis of strong democratisation proffers the notion that the private shareholder, as an ascendant class of financial actor, engages with real democratic processes in addition to simply owning securities. To test this thesis the dissertation measures the extent to which small shareholders control the objective conditions under which they accumulate greater wealth by seeking evidence of potential or actual engagement with macro-market and meso-corporate level social processes. The dissertation assesses macro-level practice by drawing on the work of Bourdieu and on notions of the social field. It considers the entry of the new class of financial actor to the financial field and analyses their capacity to accumulate and deploy informational capital, and compares their ability to influence a state-sponsored economic reform process (CLERP) with that of other actors. The dissertation analyses longitudinal ownership and shareholder voting data from a set of over 30 major Australian companies. It finds that the new class of economic actor is most prevalent in privatised state-owned enterprises and mutuals. In the context of an ideal Habermasian public sphere, the study considers the potential for small shareholders to participate in meso-level, corporate agenda-setting and deliberation. Using the ideal political space of Arendt, it searches for methods of achieving democratic outcomes. The dissertation finds that while the personal ownership of tradable financial assets may constitute a weak form of economic democratisation, small shareholders?? inability to influence real outcomes, even in companies in which they constitute the majority, places substantial restrictions on the overall strength of the share ownership-as-democracy thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">class analysis</field><field name="subject">share ownership</field><field name="subject">democratisation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Method development in electrospray ionisation fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry study of plant oils - macadamia oil as a model</field><field name="creator">Mokhtari-Fard, Ahmad, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A novel analytical method is developed to examine the chemical composition of plant oils by electrospray ionisation high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in both positive- and negative-ion modes. To date, this is the first reported application of this technique for the study of macadamia nut oil. Samples of macadamia nut oil from the Macadamia Integrifolia- Proteaceae family (smooth shell) are examined. The fatty acid profile of the oil is obtained by this mass spectrometric examination of the transesterified and hydrolysed oil samples. The Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry results are compared to those obtained from similar samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  techniques. High performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry are used to separate and assign the isomers present in the methanol extract of the oils in separate experiments. Significant results in this study include: - The first observation and identity of a number of oxidised triacylglycerols in macadamia oil samples. - The first observation of oxidised and free fatty acids, measured directly in hydrolysed oil and in the methanol extract of macadamia oil. - High resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in broadband mode which enables isobars to be observed. - Esterified oil Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry results are consistent with our gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results and with the results of similar studies on macadamia oil in the literature. - A number of fatty acids with odd number of carbon atoms are observed in the oil. - In electrospray ionisation Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry of oils, the sample preparation is straightforward. The sample is dissolved in methanol or acetonitrile and the solution is introduced to the electrospray source directly. Introducing oil samples to the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer needs the oils to be esterified prior to the analysis. - In this work, state-of-the-art mass spectrometry demonstrates distinct advantages in comparison to gas chromatography measurements such as direct identification of free fatty acids in oil samples, whereas this is not possible in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry due to the required esterification step prior to the analysis. - High performance liquid chromatography fraction collection is combined with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in off-line mode and found to improve the sensitivity, selectivity and signal to noise levels due to the lower number of compounds in each high performance liquid chromatography fraction compared to the methanol extract of macadamia oil sample. Also isomers of monoacylglycerols have been resolved using the high performance liquid chromatography technique.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High performance liquid chromatography</field><field name="subject">Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Plant oils</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of organisational effectiveness :  contingent coupling of human, structural and financial resources through knowledge management practices</field><field name="creator">Antoniak, Edward, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the findings of an empirical study of the effectiveness of knowledge management practices in an environment of principal-agent and market testing conditions in the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO) during the period 2001-2005.  Using a grounded theory research approach and a longitudinal case study, the ADO's workforce planning community of practice is the focus of the study.  The research is conducted in the context of the knowledge-based view of the firm, which holds that organisational effectiveness and thus sustained competitiveness is dependant on the continual creation, application and protection of new and unique knowledge.  Pertinent knowledge management theories are reviewed and reframed in terms of loose coupling concepts, which are then used to describe the variety of knowledge creating relationships and opportunities for workforce planning that become apparent during the course of field research studies.   The impact of market testing, as a precursor to outsourcing, on the creation of new knowledge in workforce planning is examined progressively during field studies. The role of leadership in maintaining effective workforce knowledge management practices emerges as the primary category in the loose coupling analysis process.   The paper suggests that in order to sustain competitive advantage in workforce planning that is conducted in a commercial support or market testing environment, trust-based leadership and the use of appropriate knowledge management practices are necessary.  The dissertation has important implications for research and practice. Specifically, the loose coupling framework provides a focus for literature reviews in future research of knowledge management and, in terms of professional practice, the framework is developed into an aide-m??moire that can be used to enhance knowledge management practices to meet workforce planning objectives. The aide-m??moire potentially has wider application as a tool to assess the effectiveness of knowledge management within the organisation as well as informing the selection of remedial knowledge management practices.

The TNFR associated factor (TRAF) family are signal adapter molecules that are recruited to various members of the TNFR family and are important for the transduction of signals downstream of these receptors.  In these studies, gene targeting was used to create a mouse capable of undergoing conditional inactivation of the Traf3 gene.  These mice were studied alongside previously generated mice that were similarly genetically modified with respect to the Traf2 gene.  The mice produced lacked expression of either TRAF2 or TRAF3 in either B or T cells.  In resting B cells TRAF2 and TRAF3 were shown to cooperate to negatively regulate the signalling of B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) and its receptor (BAFF-R), the TNF ligand and receptor pair that provide obligate survival signals to B cells.  Thus, TRAF2- and TRAF3-deficient B cells displayed hyperactive NF-kB2 signalling, an increased ability to survive, and almost identical gene expression profiles, emphasizing the cooperative nature of their roles in resting B cells.  Importantly, the survival of these B cells was completely independent of BAFF.  In normal B cells, BAFF signalling was shown to lift the negative regulation of survival mediated by TRAF2 and TRAF3, by depleting TRAF3 from the cell.  This process was shown to require TRAF2.  T cells deficient in TRAF2 or TRAF3 also displayed hyperactivity of the NF-kB2 pathway, but they did not accumulate in vivo or show extended survival in vitro.  Mice lacking TRAF2 or TRAF3 in their T cells did however display a decrease in the number of memory phenotype CD8+ T cells.  These studies indicate that some of the roles of TRAF2 and TRAF3 are common between B and T cells.  However, the consequences of loss of TRAF2 or TRAF3 in B and T cells differs considerably, presumably due to the differential TNFR expression and usage by each cell type.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">B lymphocyte</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Signalling</field><field name="subject">TRAF</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strongly orthotropic continuum mechanics</field><field name="creator">Kellermann, David Conrad, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The principal contribution of this dissertation is a theory of Strongly Orthotropic Continuum Mechanics that is derived entirely from an assertion of geometric strain indeterminacy.

This continuum theory births the proposal of a new class of physical tensors described as the Intrinsic Field Tensors capable of generalising the response of most classical mechanical metrics, a number of specialised formulations and the solutions shown to be kinematically intermediate. A series of numerical examples demonstrate Euclidean objectivity, material frame-indifference, patch test satisfaction, and agreement between the subsequent Material Principal Co-rotation and P??I??C decomposition methods that produce the intermediary stress/strain fields. The encompassing theory has wide applicability owing to its fundamental divergence from conventional mechanics, it offers non-trivial outcomes when applied to even very simple problems and its use of not the Eulerian, Lagrangian but the Intrinsic Frame generates previously unreported results in strongly orthotropic continua.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">Strongly orthotropic</field><field name="subject">Continuum mechanics</field><field name="subject">Intrinsic field tensors</field><field name="subject">Strain tensor</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orthokeratology epithelial changes and susceptibility to microbial infection</field><field name="creator">Choo, Jennifer Denise, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Orthokeratology (OK) is a specialty contact lens procedure that involves the overnight wear of lenses to reshape the corneal tissue resulting in clear vision upon lens removal.  Currently it is the only way of achieving clear vision without having to wear spectacles or contact lenses during the day or undergoing refractive surgery.  This thesis investigated the effects of this procedure on the corneal epithelium and the potential increase in risk of microbial infection in an animal model.  The cat was first established as an appropriate animal model in a pilot study to examine OK epithelial changes.  Initial findings of epithelial thickness changes similar to those found with human myopic and hyperopic OK clinical studies led to the further development of this animal model to better mimic human lens wear for the remaining studies undertaken.  Histological studies were used to examine epithelial effects of overnight myopic OK lens wear.  Repeatable and differential effects on epithelial thickness and morphology across the cornea were found, including thinning of the central and peripheral epithelium and thickening of the mid-peripheral epithelium.  Central thinning was attributed to compression of cells and was less in overnight wear compared to continuous wear.  Mid-peripheral thickening was due to increased cell layers and peripheral thinning was attributed to cellular compression.  Recovery of epithelial morphologic and thickness changes commenced one day after ceasing lens wear and was complete within one week.  Minimal changes to keratocyte populations in regions adjacent to epithelial thickness changes were found.  Microbiological studies investigated the effect of epithelial changes on corneal susceptibility to bacterial infections by exposing OK-treated corneas to large amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The hypothesis that OK lenses increased susceptibility to infection (within the time tested) was rejected as no infections were produced in any animals (except the positive scratch control).  Length of OK treatment, duration and quantity of bacterial exposure, lens wearing schedule and bacterial strain type did not affect susceptibility to infection.  The epithelium is a major contributor to OK-induced corneal changes.  These epithelial changes are reversible and do not appear to predispose to infection provided corneal integrity is maintained.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infection</field><field name="subject">Orthokeratology</field><field name="subject">Epithelium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlating structural and optical properties of silicon nanocrystals embedded in silicon nitride: An experimental study of quantum confinement for photovoltaic applications</field><field name="creator">Scardera, Giuseppe, ARC Centre of Excellence in Advanced Silicon Photovoltaics &amp; Photonics, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Silicon nanocrystals embedded in silicon nitride have received attention as promising materials for optoelectronic applications. More specifically, band gap engineering of novel materials based on silicon nanocrystals has been proposed for possible application in an all-silicon tandem solar cell within the field of `third generation' photovoltaics. Such an application would require nanocrystals to exhibit quantum confinement whereby the optical and electrical properties of a film could be tuned by controlling the size of these `quantum dots'. This thesis investigates the correlation between the structural and optical properties of silicon nanocrystals grown in silicon nitride multilayer structures via solid phase crystallisation, as part of an experimental investigation into quantum confinement.  A study of the relevant processing parameters for the solid phase crystallization of silicon nanocrystals in amorphous silicon nitride is presented and the effectiveness of the multilayer approach for controlling nanocrystal size is demonstrated. Structural characterisation using transmission electron microscopy and glancing incidence x-ray diffraction is complemented with a new application of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for the detection of silicon nanocrystals. A case study on the effects of annealing temperature on the photoluminescence from silicon nitride multilayers is presented. While a clear correlation between the structural, molecular and optical properties is demonstrated, evidence of quantum confinement remains ambiguous. The investigation into the limits of parameter space for the formation of silicon nanocrystals in silicon nitride multilayers also leads to the formation of a novel Si-Si3N4 nanocomposite material. A comprehensive study of the photoluminescence from silicon nanocrystals embedded in nitride is presented in the context of homogeneous and multilayer nitride films. Size dependent PL and absorption is demonstrated for silicon nitride multilayers with silicon-rich silicon nitride layer thicknesses varying from 1 to 4.5 nm, indicating the formation of quantum wells. These same structures are annealed to form arrays of silicon nanocrystals. Although the PL and absorption spectra suggest quantum effects, inherent ambiguities remain. The findings in this thesis provide greater insight into the nature of confinement and indicate the need for further research if the successful implementation of these structures into an all silicon tandem cell is to be achieved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multilayers</field><field name="subject">silicon nanocrystals</field><field name="subject">silicon nitride</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salinity hazard mapping and risk assessment in the Bourke irrigation district</field><field name="creator">Buchannan, Sam, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">At no point in history have we demanded so much from our agricultural land whilst simultaneously leaving so little room for management error. Of the many possible environmental impacts from agriculture, soil and water salinisation has some of the most long-lived and deleterious effects. Despite its importance, however, land managers are often unable to make informed decisions of how to manage the risk of salinisation due to a lack of data. Furthermore, there remains no universally agreed method for salinity risk mapping. This thesis addresses these issues by investigating new methods for producing high-resolution predictions of soil salinity, soil physical properties and groundwater depth using a variety of traditional and emerging ancillary data sources. The results show that the methodologies produce accurate predictions yielding natural resource information at a scale and resolution not previously possible. Further to this, a new methodology using fuzzy logic is developed that exploits this information to produce high-resolution salinity risk maps designed to aid both agricultural and natural resource management decisions. The methodology developed represents a new and effective way of presenting salinity risk and has numerous advantages over conventional risk models. The incorporation of fuzzy logic provides a meaningful continuum of salinity risk and allows for the incorporation of uncertainty. The method also allows salinity risk to be calculated relative to any vegetation community and shows where the risk is coming from (root-zone or groundwater) allowing more appropriate management decisions to be made. The development of this methodology takes us a step closer to closing what some have called our greatest gap in agricultural knowledge. That is, our ability to manage the salinity risk at the subcatchment scale.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fuzzy analysis</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Precision agriculture</field><field name="subject">Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Multiple criteria analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the influence of Edo and Meiji period monster art on contemporary Japanese visual media</field><field name="creator">Papp, Zilia, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract Japanese anime being an important part of modern and contemporary popular visual culture, its aesthetic merits, its roots in Japanese visual arts as well as its rich symbology derived from Japanese folkloristic, literary and religious themes are worth investigating. This research aims to track the visual links between Edo and Meiji period monster art (y??kai-ga) paintings and modern day anime by concentrating on the works of Edo and Meiji period painters and the post-war period animation and manga series Gegegeno Kitaro, created by Mizuki Shigeru. Some of the Japanese origins of anime and manga imagery can be traced back to the early 12th century Ch??j?? Giga animal scrolls, where comic art and narrative pictures first appear. However, more recent sources are found in woodblock prints of the late Edo period. These prints are the forerunners of manga in that dialogues appear with the image, generally no anatomical details are given nor are they in perspective, but often a mood is expressed in a cartoon-like manner. The visual rendering of y??kai (monsters) is a Japanese cultural phenomenon: y??kai paintings originate in the Muromachi period, and take up part of the visual arts of that era. The distinct monster (y??kai) imagery emerging in the late Edo to early Meiji periods is the focus of this research. Investigating the Gegegeno Kitaro series, the study pinpoints the visual roots of the animation characters in the context of y??kai folklore and Edo and Meiji period monster painting traditions. Being a very popular series consisting of numerous episodes broadcast from the 1960s to the present time, by analyzing the changing images related to the representation of monsters in the series the study documents the changes in the perception of monsters in this time period, while it reflects on the importance of Mizuki??s work in keeping visual traditions alive and educating new audiences about folklore by recasting y??kai imagery in modern day settings in an innovative way. Additionally, by analyzing and comparing character, set, costume and mask design, plot and storyline of y??kai-themed films, the study attempts to shed light on the roles the representations of y??kai have been assigned in post-war Japanese cinema.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">animation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human rights obligations and Australian newspapers:  a media monitoring project, using peace journalism to evaluate Australian newspaper coverage of the 2004 HREOC report regarding children in detention centres.</field><field name="creator">Andreasson, Tobias Martin, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research thesis investigates news journalists?? role in the promotion and protection of peace and human rights. I explore how news journalists do not just have the ability, through the discursive selections they make, to be a catalyst for peace and non-violent solutions, it is their obligation under international human rights. My study links arguments about universal ethics for media based on international human rights with the practical and analytical approach of ??peace journalism??. The main argument rests on the idea that objectivity or impartiality in news journalism does not equal ethical neutrality since there is always a discursive selection made by the news journalists. In order to monitor whether news journalists discursive selections comply with the international human rights obligations, I have explored how the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) report A Last Resort? were covered in three Australian newspapers when it was published in 2004. The HREOC report was a testament of human rights abuses by the Australian Federal Governments towards children in Australian detention centres. I establish that health professionals were a significant group for both HREOC??s main findings and recommendations and a key group for the contextualisation of the human rights violations explored and exposed in the HREOC report. Informed by conflict analysis and peace studies theories I argue HREOC establish how the detention policy equals ??structural violence?? that caused ??direct violence??, which was justified and normalised because ??cultural violence??. I use discourse analysis to explore the discursive selections in the newspapers, and establish that the report received limited coverage and health professionals were omitted in the news while the political conflict was reported. This trivialised the report and health professionals?? role, which led to the naturalisation and normalisation of the violence. I finally reinforce these finding by exploring alternatives to the coverage using a peace journalism framework, which further clarifies the subjective nature of the discursive selection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Rights</field><field name="subject">Media Monitoring</field><field name="subject">Peace Journalism</field><field name="subject">Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Detention Centres</field><field name="subject">Australian Newspapers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of phosphorus-donor based silicon qubit and nanoelectronic devices</field><field name="creator">Escott, Christopher Colin, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Modelling of phosphorus donor-based silicon (Si:P) qubit devices and mesoscopic single-electron devices is presented in this thesis. This theoretical analysis is motivated by the use of Si:P devices for scalable quantum computing. Modelling of Si:P single-electron devices (SEDs) using readily available simulation tools is presented. The mesoscopic properties of single and double island devices with source-drain leads is investigated through ion implantation simulation (using Crystal-TRIM), 3D capacitance extraction (FastCap) and single-electron circuit simulation (SIMON). Results from modelling two generations of single and double island Si:P devices are given, which are shown to accurately capture their charging behaviour. The trends extracted are used to forecast limits to the reduction in size of this Si:P architecture. Theoretical analysis of P2+:Si charge qubits is then presented. Calculations show large ranges for the SET measurement signal, &#916;q, and geometric ratio factor, &#945;, are possible given the 'top-down' fabrication procedure. The charge qubit energy levels are calculated using the atomistic simulator NEMO 3-D coupled to TCAD calculations of the electrostatic potential distribution, further demonstrating the precise control required over the position of the donors. Theory has also been developed to simulate the microwave spectroscopy of P2+:Si charge qubits in a decohering environment using Floquet theory. This theory uses TCAD finite-volume modelling to incorporate realistic fields from actual device gate geometries. The theory is applied to a specific P2+:Si charge qubit device design to study the effects of fabrication variations on the measurement signal. The signal is shown to be a sensitive function of donor position. Design and analysis of two different spin qubit architectures concludes this thesis. The first uses a high-barrier Schottky contact, SET and an implanted P donor to create a double-well suitable for implementation as a qubit. The second architecture is a MOS device that combines an electron reservoir and SET into a single structure, formed from a locally depleted accumulation layer. The design parameters of both architectures are explored through capacitance modelling, TCAD simulation, tunnel barrier transmission and NEMO 3-D calculations. The results presented strengthen the viability of each architecture, and show a large &#916;q (&gt; 0.1e) can be expected.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">qubit</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">nanoelectronic</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of cellular changes associated with increased production of human follicle stimulating hormone in a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cell line</field><field name="creator">Misztal, David Richard, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A proteomics approach was used to identify proteins potentially implicated in the cellular response concurrent with elevated production levels of human follicle stimulating hormone in a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (Darren cells), using zinc and sodium butyrate in the production media to increase expression.

In particular, this thesis examines whether these biases are detrimental to fund performance and market efficiency, and whether there is a need for regulatory review given the behaviour of institutions in their trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  The three empirical issues examined in this thesis are: leader and follower patterns in institutional trading; quarter-end gaming behaviour; and short-term trading activity and the role of institutional monitoring.  Firstly, in the analysis of leader-follower behaviour, this thesis finds profitable trade packages are executed using multiple brokers as a way to accumulate a larger package in a shorter window of time and as means of enhancing disguise.  Profitability is higher when these trade packages are mimicked and when there are up to three mimickers, compared to situations in which no mimicking occurs. Potential mimickers do not appear to ignore their own signal when deciding whether or not to follow when the sequence is short, but may do so for longer sequences as predicted by Grenadier (1999). It is concluded that short sequences of mimicking trades by active fund managers speed the price discovery process. Secondly, in an investigation of ??portfolio pumping?? by Australian active investment managers, this thesis finds significant abnormal stock and fund returns on the final business day of the calendar quarter-end.  This thesis then identifies particular trades, appearing mostly in less liquid stocks, which accompany stocks that are marked up at quarter-end (it is not possible in this thesis to prove causation given the trades in this sample are not time-stamped).  Fund managers execute more purchases than normal on the last day of the quarter in stocks in which they are overweight, providing strong evidence that manager behaviour is modified on the last day of the quarter-end.  This study also finds poor-performing managers are more likely to perpetrate gaming trades, which may be as a result of career concerns and business risk management.  New investors in funds would benefit substantially by delaying their entry to the fund until the day after the end of the quarter, as there is a lower entry price into the fund.  However, portfolio pumping does not substantially affect the returns of extant fund investors, as the trading cost associated with the relatively small gaming trades is relatively small.  Attempts by the ASX to reduce price manipulation, such as instituting a closing price call auction and then later revising the algorithm of this auction, have been effective in limiting both the number of occurrences, as well as the severity of gaming on the efficiency of the market. Thirdly, in an examination of the short-term trading activity of active investment managers which threaten exit, this thesis find that a larger number of actively trading multi-blockholders significantly raises firm performance. It remains true that an individual blockholder who intervenes to raise firm performance has to share gains with other blockholders. But firm manager effort is enhanced by the threat of exit by blockholders when they receive a bad signal concerning managerial effort. This study tests seven nested hypotheses proposed by Edmans and Manso (2008) using sequences of short-term institutional trades that threaten exit. Blockholder net profit is diminishing in the number of traders, consistent with a common signal of poor managerial performance. Moreover, these trade sequences are profitable even after transaction costs. Spreads are lower and the firm??s share price becomes more sensitive to managerial performance as more blockholders threaten exit. From the three broad investigations into fund manager activity this thesis undertakes, active fund managers are shown to behave rationally and, apart from their behaviour at quarter-end, they act in the interests of their investors, aid price discovery, reduce bid-ask spreads and thereby exhibit a positive influence on market efficiency.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blockholders</field><field name="subject">Herding</field><field name="subject">Pumping</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performing postmemories: recollection in crisis</field><field name="creator">Trezise, Bryoni, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the problematic status and functioning of memory in a variety of contemporary contexts such as judicial cases, popular culture, television, memorials and museums. In doing this it develops an account of the culture of postmemory, originally defined by Marianne Hirsch as the experience of descendents of survivors of trauma, particularly second generation Holocaust survivors, who inherit that trauma from their family forbears. From Hirsch, postmemory can be understood as the possibility of remembering an event that one has not actually experienced. This thesis extends Hirsch???s notion of postmemory to account for a wider range of contemporary memory practices. These occur beyond family relationships to manifest in institutional and discursive sites such as the archive, the museum, the narrative and the tourist attraction. This thesis argues that it is in these sites that memory can be seen to be breaking away from its referential function. Instead of recollection, memory becomes the performance of slippage and the undoing of reference in which the fictive and the historical merge. The thesis plays out the ensuing crisis in recollection in scenes and actions of a theatre of the postmemorial ??? one characterised less by the familiar linear narratives of memory as by multiple and contradictory narratives formed through the operations of chance, reflexivity and ambivalence working within the contemporary cultural sphere. Performing Postmemories re-imagines the performances of contemporary memory culture and examines its master texts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postmemory</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">cultural memory</field><field name="subject">archive</field><field name="subject">trauma</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prawns, climate change, rising costs and falling prices : managing NSW???s prawn stocks in a world of uncertainties : a quantitative analysis of prawn harvesting strategies</field><field name="creator">Ives, Matthew Carl, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The monitoring and assessment of prawn populations in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, has been identified as a continuing research priority by both the fishing industry and the fisheries managers. This dissertation presents a series of dynamic population models developed to evaluate the status of the eastern king prawn (Melicertus plebejus) and eastern school prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) populations within NSW and to analyse the relative performance of a number of alternative management strategies involving the three fisheries that target these species. Monthly commercial prawn catch and effort data from 1984 to 2006 were used to calibrate the stock assessment models. Where possible, the results of previous research were used to develop the structure of the model and to provide estimates of biological parameters. A process of increasing model complexity, including the addition of physical processes, such as river discharge events and economic considerations, was undertaken in an attempt to develop the most appropriate model for the analysis of management strategies.  The first model presented was used to undertake a single-species assessment of the eastern king prawn stock and was based on a delay-difference population model with four different representations of recruitment. This model was calibrated to observations using the Bayesian sampling/importance re-sampling method and used to test the effect of significant changes in the future catch on the stock. The second model presented is a size-based metapopulation model which incorporated the dynamics of school prawns over three habitats, being harvested by three different fishing methods. This model was used to test the effect of alternative climate variability scenarios on the stock. The third model presented is a multi-species, multi-fishery bio-economic model. This model was used to examine the impact of nine alternative economic scenarios, incorporating various combinations of input costs and product prices. The results from the use of these models indicated that neither of the prawn population appeared to be over-exploited. The analyses also indicated that none of the alternative management strategies were found to stand-out enough to justify a move away from the current management strategy of input controls and spatio-temporal closures, even under a range of future scenarios including climate change and large movements in input costs and product prices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural resource management.</field><field name="subject">Fisheries modelling.</field><field name="subject">Fisheries population dynamics.</field><field name="subject">Bayesian modelling.</field><field name="subject">Metapopulation modelling.</field><field name="subject">Climate change.</field><field name="subject">Fisheries -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FG7142 attenuates expression of overexpectation in Pavlovian fear conditioning</field><field name="creator">Garfield, Joshua Benjamin Bernard, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments reported in this thesis studied the mechanisms of expression of overexpectation of conditioned fear, as measured by freezing. In Stage I, rats were conditioned to fear a tone and a flashing light conditioned stimulus (CS) through pairings with a 0.5 mA, 1 s shock. In Stage II, overexpectation was trained by the reinforcement of a compound of these CSs with a shock of the same magnitude. Two compound ?? shock pairings produced an overexpectation effect, as measured by freezing to presentations of the tone alone, while further Stage II training caused over-training of overexpectation. Expression of the overexpectation effect produced by two compound ?? shock pairings could be prevented by pre-test injection of the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist FG7142. This effect was dose-dependent and not due to state-dependent memory. Control experiments suggested that it was also not due to any general effect of FG7142 on the Pavlovian freezing response. Freezing to a tone that had been conditioned, but not subjected to any decremental training procedures, was unaffected by administration of FG7142 before either the conditioning or test session. FG7142 also did not affect freezing to a tone that had been subjected to an associative blocking procedure. The hypothesis that overexpectation of conditioned fear may be context-dependent was also tested. However, renewal was not observed. Rats that received Stage II training in a context distinct from the Stage I training context showed equivalent expression of overexpectation regardless of whether testing was conducted in the Stage I or Stage II training context. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that overexpectation, like extinction, leads to the imposition of a GABAA receptor-mediated mask on the fear CR. Moreover, they suggest that this masking of fear is the specific consequence of negative predictive error.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">FG7142</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">overexpectation</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="subject">Pavlovian</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="subject">benzodiazepine</field><field name="subject">GABA</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding collaboration in inter-organisational information systems: Implications for supply chain management</field><field name="creator">Pang, Vincent Ying Kiun, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore how management can work together to adopt an Inter-organisational Information System (IOIS) for Supply Chain Management (SCM) at different levels of collaboration sophistication. 20 common issues associated with collaboration and adoption of IOIS for SCM, were identified from the current literature. Two theoretical frameworks were developed. First, an IOIS for SCM Adoption Framework was constructed to understand the IOIS for SCM adoption process. Secondly, an Inter-organisational Collaboration Framework was constructed and used as a lens to examine and understand the process of inter-organisational collaboration. Five underlying theories, namely agency, needs and motivation, resource dependency, cultural and negotiated order, were drawn on to develop an understanding of collaboration in this latter framework.  The study of collaboration for IOIS adoption is exploratory. Eight organisations were approached from three industries and sixteen interviews were carried out with managers who are involved in the supply chain activities. Data was primarily collected using an interview instrument based on literature, and documentary and archival evidence. Interviews were transcribed and cross-case analysis was conducted on the data.  Three of the four levels of collaboration sophistication were supported. At the highest level of collaboration, namely cooperation sophistication, the organisations that were studied have growth motivations, same interests and common business objectives, and prepare to develop strategy and finance projects while reengineering their business processes and redesigning their supply chains collectively. Collaboration is not limited to one dimension but multi-dimensional. An organisation collaborates with its partners in one project but that at the same time, they may not want to collaborate on a different project due to differences in business objectives. When there is a disagreement between parties, negotiation is an important process to help resolve their differences.  The process of collaboration was summarised into three perspectives: industry, intra-organisational and inter-organisational. These perspectives can assist practitioners who need to understand how to address the process of collaboration in the adoption of IOISs for SCM with their partners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Inter-organisational Information System (IOIS)</field><field name="subject">Inter-organisational Information System (IOS)</field><field name="subject">Supply Chain Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical stimulation of cells involved in wound healing</field><field name="creator">Ly, Mai Thanh, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem investigated:  Chronic wounds are not only a major burden to the patient arising from general pain and discomfort but also generate economic costs to both these individuals and the health care system.  Various electrical stimulation regimes have been employed to study the effects of electrical stimulation on wound healing both in vivo and in vitro.  In was hypothesised that electrical stimulation using various waveforms can modulate cell function, particularly cell migration.  The aim of this thesis was to study the effects of electrical stimulation on cellular migration, in particular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, key cell types involved in wound healing.  The impact of collagen matrix on cell migration was also assessed.  Methods:  Cells were seeded on either glass or collagen I substrate and stimulated with various electrical regimes via platinum electrodes connected to a constant current source.  Cell migration was accessed by manual tracking of cell nuclei over a period of 3 hours from digital time-lapse images acquired during stimulation.  Data from cell tracking were analysed for directional migration, migration rates and mean square displacement.  Results:  No directional cell migration for both endothelial cells and fibroblasts were observed when stimulated with either alternating or biphasic currents.  However, surface substrate had impacted on cell motility with opposite effects being observed for the two cell types.  Endothelial cells tended to migrate at a faster rate on collagen I substrate than on glass, compared with fibroblasts, which displayed a slower rate of migration on collagen I substrate.  Significant changes in mean square displacement of biphasic current stimulated cells on collagen I substrate compared to unstimulated cells were also observed.  Conclusion:  This thesis has illustrated cell migration can be modulated by electrical stimulation, in particular asymmetric biphasic current.  It has also been demonstrated surface substrate can impact cell migration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface substrate</field><field name="subject">Electrical stimulation</field><field name="subject">Cell migration</field><field name="subject">Wound healing</field><field name="subject">Biphasic stimulation</field><field name="subject">AC stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal variation in the hydrochemistry of marine prawn aquaculture ponds built in acid sulfate soils, Queensland, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Groves, Sarah Anne, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many brackish water aquaculture ventures in Australia and overseas have established ponds in coastal regions with acid sulfate soils (ASS). Acid sulphate soils are known to leach relatively high concentrations of metals, acid (metal and H+ ion) and sulfur, however very little is known about how these leached elements affect the water quality of aquaculture ponds. The main objective of this thesis was to describe the hydrochemical processes controlling the water chemistry in the water column and sediment pore water in the studied aquaculture ponds over time and space. Water samples providing the spatio-temporal data were collected from the ponds with the use of adapted sampling methods commonly used in the groundwater environment. A transect of five nested piesometers was installed in two prawn ponds at Pimpama, south east Queensland, Australia. Each piesometer nest contained a multilevel with eight outtakes, a mini ?? horizontal, and a slotted piesometer. Water samples were collected from each nested piesometer on a bi-monthly basis over the prawn-growing season. The unstable elements and water quality variables (pH, Eh, DO, EC, water temperature) were measured in the field. Stable elements were analysed in the laboratory using ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Soil samples were collected at the end of the season for elemental analysis. A number of key sediment/water interactions and processes such as precipitation/dissolution reactions, oxidation-reduction reactions, photosynthesis, adsorption and seawater buffering were identified as important controls on pond water conditions. This is the first study to provide detailed hydrochemcial analysis of the pond water over time and space and aided in identifying that even shallow water bodies can be chemically heterogeneous. Analysis of the water and sediment highlighted the selection of metals that can be associated with ASS and that are mobilised from pond sediments under certain chemical conditions. In Pond 7 Al, As, Ni and Zn concentrations were generally higher at the beginning of the grow-out season. Variability of the metal concentration was observed between the water column (0 ?? 1500 mm) and the pore-water (0 - -1000 mm). The highest concentration of Al (1044 ??g/L) and Zn (104 ??g/L) were sampled in the water column (approximately 400 mm from the surface of the pond). The highest concentration of As (130 ??g/L) and Ni (73 ??g/L) were sampled in the pore water sediment (associated with ASS). Elevated Mn and Fe2+ concentrations were also associated with the sediment pore water. The highest concentrations of Mn and Fe2+ were 4717 ??g/L and 5100 ??g/L respectively. In Pond 10, Ni concentrations (167 ??g/L) were the highest at the beginning of the grow-out season. However, As (97 ??g/L), Al (234 ??g/L) and Zn (308 ??g/L) were most concentrated during the middle of the cycle. The highest mean concentrations of these elements are As (63 ??g/L), Al (91 ??g/L) and Zn (69 ??g/L) which are each associated with the sediment-water interface. These metals are integral in degrading the pond water quality and lead to a loss of beneficial algal blooms, a reduction in pond water pH, poor growth rates and high mortality in shrimp. It is also possible that the dissolved ions and precipitated compounds that are leached from the ASS are discharged into the adjacent coastal estuary of Moreton Bay. With knowledge obtained from this PhD study, effective management and treatment systems can be developed and implemented to minimise the impact of these soils on the pond system and the water discharging into natural coastal ecosystem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">hydrochemistry</field><field name="subject">acid sulfate soils</field><field name="subject">pond water</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">Kuruma prawns</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in human capital and taxation: effective tax rates on education, the heterogeneous human capital model and the impact of nominal rigidities in the tax system</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Glenn Michael, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I address several neglected issues relating to the theoretical and applied analysis of human capital and the impact of taxation. I begin with the problem of measuring the effective tax rate on human capital accumulation. I develop a forward-looking measure of the effective tax rate that is grounded in human capital theory, allowing for features that differentiate human capital formation from physical capital formation. These features include concavity of the earnings-investment frontier and adjustments in capital utilization through leisure. I argue that the few attempts that have been made to measure the effective tax rate on skill formation are either limited by the fact that they inherit assumptions applicable to the theory of the firm or have dubious theoretical foundations (Chapter Two). The new measure is used to derive the effective tax rate on human capital in 25 OECD countries, including Australia (Chapter Three).  While there are numerous general equilibrium models which integrate nominal rigidities of one form or another, little attention has been devoted to nominal rigidities arising from partial indexation of income tax thresholds. No doubt one of the reasons for this gap in the literature is the difficulty associated with introducing a fully specified progressive tax regime into an applied general equilibrium model. I show that this hurdle can be overcome through a zero-profit condition for general equilibrium on the labour market. The condition is integrated into an aggregative model of the economy consisting of two sectors (consumption and education) and two factors of production (skilled and unskilled labour). Since skill formation is endogenous, the model allows us to reopen research into the optimal level of skill formation and the role of government (Chapter Four). An applied general equilibrium version of the model is used to evaluate the impact of recent tax reform proposals on skill formation (Chapter Five).  A concluding chapter draws together these lines of enquiry with suggestions for future research (Chapter Six).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Effective tax rates</field><field name="subject">Human capital</field><field name="subject">Taxation</field><field name="subject">Applied general Equilibrium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epi-CHO, an episomal expression system for recombinant protein production in CHO cells</field><field name="creator">Kunaparaju, Raj Kumar, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current project is to develop a transient expression system for Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells based on autonomous replication and retention of plasmid DNA. The expression system, named Epi-CHO comprises (1) a recombinant CHO-K1 cell line encoding the Polyoma (Py) virus large T-Antigen (PyLT-Ag), and (2) a DNA expression vector, pPy/EBV encoding the Py Origin (PyOri) for autonomous replication and encoding the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1) and EBV Origin of replication (OriP) for plasmid retention. The CHO-K1 cell line expressing PyLT-Ag, named CHO-T was adapted to suspension growth in serum-free media (EXCELL-302) to facilitate large scale transient transfection and recombinant (r) protein production. PyLT-Ag-expressed in CHO-T supported replication of PyOri-containing plasmids and enhanced growth and r- protein production. A scalable cationic lipid based transfection was optimised for CHO-T cells using LipofectAMINE-2000??. Destabilised Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (D2EGFP) and Human Growth Hormone (HGH) were used as reporter proteins to demonstrate transgene expression and productivity. Transfection of CHO-T cells with the vector pPy/EBV encoding D2EGFP showed prolonged and enhanced EGFP expression, and transfection with pPy/EBV encoding HGH resulted in a final concentration of 75 mg/L of HGH in culture supernatant 11 days following transfection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transient</field><field name="subject">Mammalian</field><field name="subject">Episomal</field><field name="subject">Large Scale</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding bacteria-protozoa interactions: from grazing resistance mechanisms to carbon flow in bacteria-protozoa food webs</field><field name="creator">Moreno, Ana Maria, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bacteria-protozoa interactions are one of the oldest between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. As such, their study offers a unique opportunity to understand the different relationships that have evolved between them, including pathogenesis, and how their interaction can affect some important processes, such as wastewater treatment. In the first part of the work described here, the grazing defence mechanisms employed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa against the surface grazer, Acanthamoeba castellanii, were investigated. P. aeruginosa cells from early logarithmic growth and stationary phase were found to use different defence strategies. The type-III secretion system (T3SS) was found to be responsible for cytotoxicity of early logarithmic growth cells against A. castellanii. Of the three exotoxins produced by P. aeruginosa PA99, the phospholipase ExoU was found to make the greatest contribution to bacterial toxicity against the amoebae. Interestingly, a PA99null mutant that does not produce any known exotoxins but synthesises a secretion apparatus, was also found to be toxic to the amoeba, suggesting that the T3SS was being used to translocate other unknown toxins. Quorum sensing regulated virulence factor production was found to be involved in the grazing defence response of stationary phase P. aeruginosa cells. A. castellanii was found to be most susceptible to hydrogen cyanide and elastase produced during late logarithmic and stationary phase. In the second part, a stable isotope probing method was developed to investigate carbon flow through bacteria-protozoa food webs in activated sludge. The method was subsequently used to track carbon from bicarbonate and acetate through bacteria-orotozoa food webs under ammonia oxidising and nitrate reducing conditions. It was found that the Peritrich ciliate Campanella umbellaria, dominated the acquisition of carbon from bacteria with access to CO2 under ammonia oxidising conditions. Thus it appears that some of these bacteria must live in the plankton, as C. umbellaria is a filter feeder. No specific protozoan groups were found to dominate carbon acquisition from bacteria with access to acetate, under nitrate reducing conditions, probably due to label dilution.  Overall the results presented here showed how bacteria-protozoa interactions have shaped infectious processes in higher eukaryotes, and the dynamics of carbon flow in activated sludge.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grazing resistance</field><field name="subject">Bacteria-protozoa interactions</field><field name="subject">Bacteria-protozoa food webs</field><field name="subject">Protozoa</field><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The extracellular functions of S100A12</field><field name="creator">Goyette, Jesse Davis, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The S100s comprise a group of Ca2+-binding proteins of the EF-hand superfamily with varied functions. Within this family, three inflammatory-related proteins - S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 - form a subcluster known as the 'calgranulins'. S100A12 levels are elevated in sera from patients with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. S100A12 is constitutively expressed in neutrophils and induced in monocytes by LPS and TNF&#945;, and in macrophages by IL-6. S100A12 is a potent monocyte and mast cell chemoattractant and its potentiation of mast cell activation by IgE cross-linking indicates an important role in allergic inflammation. Importantly, mast cell-dependent activation of acute inflammatory responses and monocyte recruitment is provoked by S100A12 administration in vivo. S100A12 may also influence adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells, stimulate IL 1&#946; and TNFinduced in monocytes production in BV 2 microglial cells, and stimulate IL 2 secretion by T lymphocytes via ligation of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). To date, the only extracellular receptor characterised for S100A12 is RAGE, although additional/alternate receptors are indicated. In particular, recent studies indicate that chemotaxis and mast cell activation by S100A12 are likely mediated by other receptors. The studies presented here investigated some extracellular functions of S100A12, factors influencing these functions and suggest mechanisms that may be involved. In addition to Ca2+, S100A12 binds Zn2+. Chapter 3 explores the relevance Zn2+ binding to S100A12 structure and function. Zn2+ induced formation of complexes, principally hexamers, and this was not influenced by Ca2+. S100A12 inhibited the gelatinolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and  9 by chelating Zn2+ from their active sites. MMPs are important in processes leading to plaque rupture. An antibody that specifically recognised Zn2+-induced complexes was generated and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated S100A12, the hexameric complex, and MMP 2 and  9 co-localisation in human atheroma. These results suggest that hexameric S100A12 may form in vivo and may implicate S100A12 in regulating plaque rupture by inhibiting MMP activity. Interestingly S100A12 synergised with LPS to induce MMP 3 and  13 expression in vitamin D3-differentiated THP 1 macrophages (THP 1 macs). S100A12 regulation of MMP expression and activity indicates that it may be involved in a self-regulatory loop, which depends on relative levels of Zn2+ and on other stimuli (eg LPS) in the inflammatory milieu. Chapter 4 describes the development of tools and methods for assessing interactions of S100A12 with cell surface receptors. To assay surface binding, an alkaline phosphatase fusion protein, a biotinylated hinge peptide and biotinylated recombinant S100A12 were generated; only S100A12 b proved useful. Surface binding of S100A12 was detected on several monocytoid/macrophage and mast cells using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. Some cells contained intracytoplasmic granular structures that were S100A12-positive. Unexpectedly, a subpopulation of cells in murine bone marrow-derived mast cell cultures that expressed low levels of c-kit, a marker of mature mast cells, bound high levels of S100A12. These may represent haematopoietic stem cells, which express low levels of c kit, and S100A12-mediated functional changes of these cells is worthy of characterisation. Unlike interactions of S100A8/A9 with endothelial cells, pre-incubation of S100A12 with Zn2+ or heparin had no effect on surface binding to THP 1 macs, indicating that Zn2+-induced structural changes were unlikely to alter receptor interactions. Heparan sulfate moieties are unlikely to mediate surface binding of S100A12 even though S100A12 bound heparin with relatively high affinity. Chapter 5 focussed on mechanisms involved in some S100A12 extracellular functions. Based on experiments studying effects of bovine S100A12 on BV-2 murine microglial cells, S100A12 is proposed to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine in monocytes via RAGE. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or human THP 1 macs activated with S100A12 did not increase cytokine induction at the mRNA or protein levels, indicating that the 'S100/RAGE pro-inflammatory axis' theory should be re-evaluated. In an attempt to provide insights into a novel receptor, mechanisms involved in S100A12-provoked THP 1 chemotaxis were investigated. This activity was sensitive to pertussis toxin, but not to an ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor, suggesting involvement of a G protein-coupled receptor. Although some RAGE ligands also bind and activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) antibodies to TLR2 and TLR4 did not block S100A12 binding to THP 1 macs. Affinity enrichment and separation of proteins by SDS PAGE and peptide mapping by mass spectrometry identified the &#945; and &#947; subunits of F1 ATP synthase, implicating ATP synthase as a putative receptor. Although primarily mitochondrial, this complex is expressed on the surface of several cell types and was confirmed on THP 1 cells and mast cells by flow cytometry. By modulating surface F1 ATP synthase activity, and thereby extracellular ATP/ADP concentrations, S100A12 may mediate its pro-inflammatory functions through G-protein coupled purinergic receptors. This work has generated new directions for studying mechanisms by which S100A12 influences monocyte/macrophage and mast cell functions that are relevant to important inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and allergic inflammation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">S100 proteins</field><field name="subject">S100A12</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The power relationships between doctors, patients and the party-state under the impact of red packets in the Chinese health-care system</field><field name="creator">Yang, Jingqing, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The paper examines ??red packets?? ?? a form of informal payment ?? in the Chinese health-care system from the perspectives of power and ??inxit?? theories.

As an interdisciplinary activity with several different actors, one of its aspects involves Product Environmental Performance considerations, and this is becoming an area where companies see opportunities for competition. In light of increasing pressures to adopt more sustainable approaches to product design and manufacture, the requirement to develop sustainable products is one of the key challenges facing manufacturing industry in the 21st century. Besides the Product Environmental Performance, there are three key requirements to be considered, which include Product Life Cycle Cost, Product Quality, and Product Lead Time. Product Life Cycle Cost and Product Quality are very traditional facets in decision-making in a design process. A product with low cost and high performance is always the objective in industry. For the last two decades, shortening the Product Lead Time to increase profits is another key requirement that has been adopted. Trade-offs among these four key requirements are necessary when choices have to be made between different alternatives. In this research, an integrated methodology is proposed to balance the environmental performance of a product against traditional design objectives, in the decision making process during the early design stage. Finally, a concept of product performance indicator was introduced to compare product design activities.  In order to achieve this, a weighting system has been developed to assess the total performance of competing design alternatives. Later, this weighting system is integrated into a fuzzy model in order to compensate for the fuzziness in the available data. Additionally, the method is used to rank five important product development features, which are Technology Level of the Product, Speed of Technical Development, Product Life Cycle, Price Competitiveness, and Environmental Awareness, assisted by the weighting system. Finally, a total product performance concept is proposed in order to allow the user to carry out trade-off analysis between different design alternatives. Two case studies, which are a car sunroof and a mobile phone, were used to test the validity of the produce performance methodology proposed in this research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural ventilation in double-skin fa??ade design for office buildings in hot and humid climate</field><field name="creator">Wong, Pow Chew James, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research seeks to find a design solution for reducing the energy usage in high-rise office buildings in Singapore. There are numerous methods and techniques that could be employed to achieve the purpose of designing energy efficient buildings. The Thesis explores the viability of double-skin fa??ades (DSF) to provide natural ventilation as an energy efficient solution for office buildings in hot and humid environment by using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations and case study methodologies.  CFD simulations were used to examine various types of DSF used in office buildings and the behaviour of airflow and thermal transfer through the DSF; the internal thermal comfort levels of each office spaces were analyzed and compared; and an optimization methodology was developed to explore the best DSF configuration to be used in high-rise office buildings in the tropics. The correlation between the fa??ade configurations, the thermal comfort parameters, and the internal office space energy consumption through the DSF is studied and presented.  The research outcome of the Thesis has found that significant energy saving is possible if natural ventilation strategies could be exploited with the use of DSF. A prototype DSF configuration which will be best suited for the tropical environment in terms of its energy efficiency through cross ventilation strategy is proposed in this Thesis. A series of comprehensive and user-friendly nomograms for design optimization in selecting the most appropriate double-skin fa??ade configurations with considerations of various orientations for the use in high-rise office buildings in the tropics were also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Office building.</field><field name="subject">Natural ventilation.</field><field name="subject">Double-skin facade.</field><field name="subject">Computational fluid dynamic.</field><field name="subject">Hot and humid climate.</field><field name="subject">Ventilation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genomic sequence processing: gene finding in eukaryotes</field><field name="creator">Akhtar, Mahmood, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Of the many existing eukaryotic gene finding software programs, none are able to guarantee accurate identification of genomic protein coding regions and other biological signals central to pathway from DNA to the protein. Eukaryotic gene finding is difficult mainly due to noncontiguous and non-continuous nature of genes. Existing approaches are heavily dependent on the compositional statistics of the sequences they learn from and are not equally suitable for all types of sequences. This thesis firstly develops efficient digital signal processing-based methods for the identification of genomic protein coding regions, and then combines the optimum signal processing-based non-data-driven technique with an existing data-driven statistical method in a novel system demonstrating improved identification of acceptor splice sites. Most existing well-known DNA symbolic-to-numeric representations map the DNA information into three or four numerical sequences, potentially increasing the computational requirement of the sequence analyzer. Proposed mapping schemes, to be used for signal processing-based gene and exon prediction, incorporate DNA structural properties in the representation, in addition to reducing complexity in subsequent processing. A detailed comparison of all DNA representations, in terms of computational complexity and relative accuracy for the gene and exon prediction problem, reveals the newly proposed ?paired numeric? to be the best DNA representation. Existing signal processing-based techniques rely mostly on the period-3 behaviour of exons to obtain one dimensional gene and exon prediction features, and are not well equipped to capture the complementary properties of exonic / intronic regions and deal with the background noise in detection of exons at their nucleotide levels. These issues have been addressed in this thesis, by proposing six one-dimensional and three multi-dimensional signal processing-based gene and exon prediction features. All one-dimensional and multi-dimensional features have been evaluated using standard datasets such as Burset/Guigo1996, HMR195, and the GENSCAN test set. This is the first time that different gene and exon prediction features have been compared using substantial databases and using nucleotide-level metrics. Furthermore, the first investigation of the suitability of different window sizes for period-3 exon detection is performed. Finally, the optimum signal processing-based gene and exon prediction scheme from our evaluations is combined with a data-driven statistical technique for the recognition of acceptor splice sites. The proposed DSP-statistical hybrid is shown to achieve 43% reduction in false positives over WWAM, as used in GENSCAN.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gaussian mixture models</field><field name="subject">deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</field><field name="subject">discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs)</field><field name="subject">correlation</field><field name="subject">discrete cosine transforms (DCTs)</field><field name="subject">Eukaryotes</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">DNA -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When home is the navel of the world: an ethnography of young Rapa Nui between home and away</field><field name="creator">Andreassen, Olaug Irene Rosvik, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rapa Nui (Easter Island) has for centuries been known as an isolated island of archaeological mysteries; yet after a rapid modernisation this is today an international tourist destination, a World Heritage Site and a glocalised community.

We formalized the following timing constraints: CInvoke constraints define time windows of availability while MInvoke constraints define expirations deadlines. We extended techniques for compatibility and replaceability analysis between timed protocols by using a semantic-preserving mapping between timed protocols and timed automata, leading to the novel class of protocol timed automata (PTA). Specifically, PTA exhibit silent transitions that cannot be removed in general, yet they are closed under complementation, making every type of compatibility or replaceability analysis decidable.

S100A8 and S100A9 are abundantly expressed in inflammatory sites such as asthmatic lung, sunburnt skin and atherosclerosis where MCs are involved in pathogenesis; roles of S100A8 in MC function are undetermined. The aims of this thesis were to determine effects of S100A8 on MC activation, particularly provoked by IgE and UVB. Initially, effects of UVB on MC activation were investigated as detailed functions were unclear. Cord blood-derived human mast cells (CBMCs) were treated in vitro with varying doses of UVB and production of multiple cytokines and viability investigated. UVB exposure selectively increased levels of IL-8 (CXCL8), and to a less extent IL-1&#946;, but not eight other cytokines tested. New protein synthesis partially contributed and IL-8 production was p38 MAPK-dependent. UVB dose-dependently induced MC apoptosis indicating a potential regulatory mechanism of MC function. The ability of recombinant S100A8, S100A9 or S100A8/9 heterodimer to modulate IgE/antigen (DNP/anti-DNP)-mediated activation of a murine MC line, and of bone marrow-derived (mBM) MC activation was determined. The S100s did not directly induce degranulation or induce IL-6. S100A8 significantly inhibited DNP/anti-DNP-provoked degranulation, and IL-6 and TNF mRNA and protein induction. S100A8 did not alter Fc&#949;RI&#945; expression. S100A9 was less effective; and the S100A8/9 complex was also suppressive. S100A8 only weakly suppressed non-specific MC degranulation. Mutation of Cys41 in S100A8 negated its suppressive activity. Because S100A8 scavenges oxidants via this reactive Cys residue, we propose that this may mediate its ability to downmodulate IgE-dependent MC responses. Similar to the thiol scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine, S100A8 but not the Ala41 mutant, attenuated DNP/anti-DNP-provoked LAT phosphorylation. However, the disulfide-bonded S100A8 dimer and S100A8 containing a sulfinamide bond between Cys41 and Lys34/35 also reduced MC activation, indicating an additional pathway(s). S100A8 did not suppress antigen/IgE-induced responses of CBMC possibly because these may not truly reflect fullymature human tissue MCs. S100A8 did not alter UVB-induced IL-8 release by CBMCs, or affect apoptosis. Murine S100A8 may have anti-inflammatory properties by regulating MC activation in an activator-specific manner, at least partially by scavenging ROS to suppress intracellular signalling.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultraviolet light (UVB)</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">mast cells</field><field name="subject">S100A8</field><field name="subject">allergic response</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of Elatostema (Urticaceae)</field><field name="creator">Hadiah, Julisasi Tri, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elatostema J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst.

Morphological and molecular analyses were conducted to evaluate the infra-familial classification of the Urticaceae, to test the monophyly of Tribe Elatostemeae, to define generic limits of Elatostema and assess its relationship within the tribe, and to examine the current infrageneric grouping within Elatostema. Phylogenetic analyses based on choloroplast DNA sequences of rbcL and trnL-F do not provide support for the monophyly of Urticaceae, because of the position of Poikilospermum (currently Cecropiaceae) within the tribe Urticeae. Although the status of Cecropiaceae is equivocal, there is support for the inclusion of this family in the Urticaceae, with Cecropia and Coussapoa (Cecropiaceae) having close affinities to the Boehmerieae and Parietarieae. The phylogenetic position of Myriocarpa is unresolved, but is excluded from the Boehmerieae, as currently classified. The Elatostemeae is paraphyletic with Pilea placed sister to the Urticeae. Evaluation of the infrageneric classification of Elatostema, based on phylogenetic analyses of both morphological and molecular data (trn and ITS) does not support the current subgeneric classification as proposed by Schr??ter and Winkler (1935, 1936).

In this thesis, a bilateral cancellous bone defect model of the femur and tibia was developed in a rodent and the spatiotemporal profile of TGF-&#946;, BMP 2 and 7, Smads 1, 4 and 5 characterised. Next, the capability of acid solution to augment healing was tested in both a bone defect and in a closed femoral fracture model. Finally, a long term oestrogen deficiency (OVX) rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis was characterised and the spatiotemporal profiles of IGF-1, IGFR-1, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, TGF-&#946;, Smad4, Smad7, VEGF, Flt-1, Ihh and FGF-2 were compared in femoral osteotomies between OVX and Sham groups. The bilateral cancellous defect model was successfully created with a number of advantages with which to recommend its use in future studies. TGF-&#946;, BMP 2 and 7, Smads 1, 4 and 5 had characteristic spatiotemporal profiles during cancellous bone defect healing suggesting that they have a regulatory role. The results of the acid study were inconclusive and problems with substance delivery and maintenance at the desired site need to be addressed in the future to fully test this hypothesis. No significant differences were detected on histology or three-point mechanical testing between the fracture calluses of acid and control groups. In the final study, OVX rats after six months had significantly increased weight and decreased bone mineral density compared to their sham counterparts. A histological delay in osteotomy healing was observed in the OVX group but no significant differences on tensile testing were seen between OVX and Sham groups up to six weeks. Immunohistochemistry revealed that delayed healing may be due to the down-regulation of IGF-1, BMP-2, 4, and 7 and the up-regulation of MMP-3 in OVX compared to Sham groups. In conclusion, the results of this thesis give some insight into the molecular biology of bone defects and osteoporotic fractures. This information may also be useful in the development of specific treatments aimed at augmenting healing in bone defects and osteoporotic fractures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancellous bone defects</field><field name="subject">fracture healing</field><field name="subject">osteoporotic fractures</field><field name="subject">growth factors</field><field name="subject">mechanical testing</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">oestrogen deficiency</field><field name="subject">rodents</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New mechanisms modulating S100A8 gene expression</field><field name="creator">Endoh, Yasumi, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">S100A8 is a highly-expressed calcium-binding protein in neutrophils and activated macrophages, and has proposed roles in myeloid cell differentiation and host defense. Functions of S100A8 are not fully understood, partly because of difficulties in generating S100A8 knockout mice. Attempts to silence S100A8 gene expression in activated macrophages and fibroblasts using RNA interference (RNAi) technology were unsuccessful. Despite establishing validated small interfering RNA (siRNA) systems, enzymaticallysynthesized siRNA targeted to S100A8 suppressed mRNA levels by only 40% in fibroblasts activated with FGF-2+heparin, whereas chemically-synthesized siRNAs suppressed S100A8 driven by an S100A8-expression vector by ~75% in fibroblasts. Suppression of the gene in activated macrophages/fibroblasts was low, and some enzymatically-synthesized siRNAs to S100A8, and unrelated siRNA to GAPDH, induced/enhanced S100A8 expression in macrophages. This indicated that S100A8 may be upregulated by type-1 interferon (IFN). IFN-&#946; enhanced expression, but did not directly induce S100A8. Poly (I:C), a synthetic dsRNA, directly induced S100A8 through IL-10 and IFN-dependent pathways. Induction by dsRNA was dependent on RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), but not cyclooxygenase-2, suggesting divergent pathways in LPS- and dsRNA-induced responses. New mechanisms of S100A8 gene regulation are presented, that suggest functions in anti-viral defense. S100A8 expression was confirmed in lungs from influenza virus-infected mice and from a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Multiple pathways via mitochondria mediated S100A8 induction in LPS-activated macrophages; Generation of reactive oxygen species via the mitochondrial electron transport chain and de novo synthesis of ATP may be involved. This pathway also regulated IL-10 production, possibly via PKR. Extracellular ATP and its metabolites enhanced S100A8 induction. Results support involvement of cell stress, such as transfection, in S100A8 expression. A breast tumor cell line (MCF-7) in which the S100A8 gene was silenced, was established using micro RNA technology; S100A8 induction by oncostatin M was reduced by &gt;90% in stably-transfected cells. This did not alter MCF-7 growth. The new approach to investigate the role of S100A8 in a human tumor cell line may assist in exploring its functions and lead to new studies concerning its role in cancer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">S100A8</field><field name="subject">Gene silencing</field><field name="subject">Macrophage activation</field><field name="subject">Interleukin 10</field><field name="subject">TLR- 3</field><field name="subject">Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conducting polymers for neural interfaces: impact of physico-chemical properties on biological performance</field><field name="creator">Green, Rylie Adelle, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the use of conducting polymer coatings on platinum (Pt) electrodes for use in neuroprostheses. Conducting polymers aim to provide an environment conducive to neurite outgrowth and attachment at the electrode sites, producing intimate contact between neural cells and stimulating electrodes. Conducting polymers were electropolymerised onto model Pt electrodes. Conventional polymers polypyrrole (PPy) and poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene (PEDOT) doped with polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) and para-toluenesulfonate (pTS)were investigated. Improvement of material properties was assessed through the layering of polymers with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The ability to incorporate cell attachment bioactivity into polymers was examined through the doping of PEDOT with anionic laminin peptides DCDPGYIGSR and DEDEDYFQRYLI. Finally, nerve growth factor (NGF), was entrapped in PEDOT during polymerisation and tested for neurite outgrowth bioactivity against the PC12 cell line. Each polymer modification was assessed for electrical performance over multiple reduction-oxidation cycles, conductivity and impedance spectroscopy, mechanical adherence and hardness, and biological response. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualise film topography and x-ray photon spectroscopy was employed to examine chemical constitution of the polymers. For application of electrode coatings to neural prostheses, optimal bioactive conducting polymer PEDOT/pTS/NGF was deposited on electrode arrays intended for implantation. PC12s were used to assess the bioactivity of NGF functionalised PEDOT when electrode size was micronised. Flexibility of the design was tested by tailoring PEDOT bioactivity for the cloned retinal ganglion cell, RGC-5, differentiated via staurasporine.  It was established that PEDOT films had superior electrical and cell growth characteristics, but only PPy was able to benefit from incorporation of MWNTs. Bioactive polymers were produced through inclusion of both laminin peptides and NGF, but the optimum film constitution was found to be PEDOT doped with pTS with NGF entrapped during electrodeposition. Application of this polymer to an implant device was confirmed through positive neurite outgrowth on vision prosthesis electrode arrays. The design was shown to be flexible when tailored for RGC-5s, with differentiation occurring on both PEDOT/pTS and PEDOT/DEDEDYFQRYLI. Conducting polymers demonstrate the potential to improve electrode-cell interactions. Future work will focus on the effect of electrical stimulation and design of bioactive polymers with improved cell attachment properties.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioactive</field><field name="subject">conducting polymers</field><field name="subject">neural interfaces</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of spoken English on learning English as a foreign language: a cognitive load perspective</field><field name="creator">Moussa, Jase, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">When learning a second language, students are taught to read, write, and listen often simultaneously, as it is assumed that it is more effective if both spoken and written versions of the same material are taught together.  However, recent research on cognitive load theory and second language learning (Diao, Chandler, &amp; Sweller, 2007; Diao &amp; Sweller, 2007) has shown that a combination of listening to and reading the same material creates a potential for redundancy (Sweller &amp; Chandler, 1994; Kalyuga, Chandler, &amp; Sweller, 1999; 2000; 2004).  Learning can be impeded if the same information appearing in one modality is repeated in the other (Sweller, 2005).  The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of listening and reading on the acquisition of listening skills.  Four experiments were conducted. During acquisition, native Arabic-speaking students were required to learn a set of English words and sentences. Learners were either exposed to written work only (single modality), auditory work only (single modality) or written work with an auditory component (dual modality). The findings in this study were consistent in that even though participants in the Read + Listen group had had more experience with listening than participants in the Read Only group, they performed more poorly on listening tasks. Students were better able to learn to listen through reading alone because working memory resources were not required to attend to another mode that contained similar, redundant information. These results also suggest that if we want learners to enhance their listening skills, they may be better off reading the materials only rather than simultaneously reading and listening.  These results are further discussed in terms of CLT and redundancy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tansnational Care Space Zentraleuropa.

A simple and fast randomised algorithm may produce results to an accuracy sufficient for many purposes, especially in the average case. In this thesis we consider average case analyses of heuristics for certain NP-hard graph optimisation problems. In particular, we consider algorithms that find dominating sets of random regular directed graphs. As well as providing an average case analysis, our results also determine new upper bounds on domination numbers of random regular directed graphs. The algorithms for random regular directed graphs considered in this thesis are known as prioritised algorithms. Each prioritised algorithm determines a discrete random process. This discrete process may be continuously approximated using differential equations. Under certain conditions, the solutions to these differential equations describe the behaviour of the prioritised algorithm. Applying such an analysis to prioritised algorithms directly is difficult. However, we are able to use prioritised algorithms to define new algorithms, called deprioritised algorithms, that can be analysed in this fashion. Defining a deprioritised algorithm based on a given prioritised algorithm, and then analysing the deprioritised algorithm, is called the deprioritised approach. The initial theory describing the deprioritised approach was developed by Wormald and has been successfully applied in many cases. However not all algorithms are covered by Wormald??s theory: for example, algorithms for random regular directed graphs. The main contribution of this thesis is the extension of the deprioritised approach to a larger class of prioritised algorithms. We demonstrate the new theory by applying it to two algorithms which find dominating sets of random regular directed graphs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">combinatorics</field><field name="subject">random graphs</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of DNA methylation in the development of colorectal neoplasia</field><field name="creator">Wong, Justin Jong Leong, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">DNA methylation is increasingly recognised as a significant epigenetic event that may initiate and drive the process of neoplasia in humans. In the colon, DNA methylation of key genes is common in a subset of colorectal cancers. The extent to which DNA methylation at various genes contributes to initiation of colorectal neoplasms is less clear. This study sought to clarify the biological and clinicopathological significance of methylation of various genes in the development of sporadic and familial colorectal neoplasia. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) assays (capable of detecting down to a measureable proportion of 0.1% of the total input DNA) were developed to determine the presence of CpG methylation at a given gene. Methylation of MLH1-C was found in the apparently normal mucosa samples from seven of 104 (7%) of individuals with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) showing microsatellite instability (MSI). No methylation of MLH1-C was found in the biological samples of individuals with microsatellite stable (MSS) counterparts (n=131). MLH1-C methylation may be a field defect that predisposes to the development of sporadic colorectal neoplasia, particularly those demonstrating MSI. Methylation of three of five genes within the 3p22 region including AB002340, MLH1, ITGA9, PLCD1 and DLEC1 (regional 3p22 methylation) was found in 83% of sporadic MSI (n=86) and 12% of MSS cancers demonstrating BRAF V600E mutation (n=42). Regional 3p22 correlated strongly with CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and other clinicopathological characteristics typical of CIMP. Thus, regional 3p22 methylation and CIMP may be overlapping phenomena. Regional 3p22 methylation and the BRAF V600E mutation were found in normal colonic mucosa of four individuals with sporadic MSI CRC, and these cases also had multiple synchronous serrated polyps. These molecular aberrancies may predispose some individuals to the development of metachronous serrated neoplasia. Germline epimutations of APC do not contribute towards the development of FAP, AFAP, or hyperplastic polyposis syndromes. However, APC methylation in normal colonic mucosa of these individuals may represent a field defect in the development of futher neoplasms. In conclusion, different patterns of DNA methylation in normal colonic mucosa may represent a field defect important in the development of different subtypes of colorectal neoplasia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Field defect.</field><field name="subject">DNA methylation.</field><field name="subject">Colorectal neoplasia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing hypotheses in molecular ecology: genetic exchange and hybrid performance</field><field name="creator">Holleley, Clare Ellen, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Population structure, gene flow and dispersal are some of the most commonly estimated population parameters in population genetics, evolutionary biology and conservation genetics. The primary aim of thesis is to test the precision and accuracy of genetic estimates of population structure, gene flow and dispersal. The controlled replicated Drosophila melanogaster experiments of known effective population size (Ne = 14.3) and dispersal rate (m = 0.0025 - 0.04) all adhered to Wright??s demographic island model. Three statistical approaches were empirically tested: 1) the conversion of population structure to gene flow using FST, RST, SHUA and PhiST ; 2) the private alleles method to estimate gene flow; 3) a Bayesian assignment method to estimate dispersal (BAYESASS 1.2). Even in the best-case scenario, almost all current methods except SHUA significantly underestimate population structure, and consequently overestimate gene flow and dispersal when applied to real populations. It was crucial to ensure that the manipulated rate of gene flow was correctly defined. This led to three supporting investigations of hybrid performance, inversion polymorphisms and effective population size. The hybrid performance investigation demonstrated that the manipulated rate of gene flow had not been unexpectedly inflated by hybrid vigour or reduced by breakdown. These experiments also demonstrated that close inbreeding is not a necessary precondition for hybrid vigour or breakdown, which is important for conservation strategies involving induced dispersal. The investigation of inversion polymorphisms ensured that the manipulated rate of gene flow was not affected by selection on inverted regions. The effective population size investigation used a temporal estimation method to confirm that the Ne was accurately predicted by an N:Ne ratio of 0.286. Additionally this experiment showed that the single-sample estimation methods implemented by ONeSAMP or LDNE resulted in downwardly biased estimates of Ne in structured populations. In conclusion these results call into question the confidence that biologists may have in some of the most widely used molecular tools in conservation biology.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hybrid fitness</field><field name="subject">Population structure</field><field name="subject">Gene flow</field><field name="subject">Dispersal</field><field name="subject">Population genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinetics of formation and characterizations of skeletal cobalt catalysts</field><field name="creator">Garciano, Leonito II, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Clear images of the open sponge structure of skeletal cobalt catalysts with and without chromium promotion are presented for the first time utilising a dual electron/focussed ion beam microscopes. Chromium promotion during leaching gives a finer structure with smaller pores. The reaction interface during leaching was sharp. The kinetics of formation of the skeletal cobalt catalyst were successfully modelled using the Avrami- Erofeev equation with a time exponent of unity - ln(1-&#945;) = Koverall t The overall specific rate constant (Koverall) was directly proportional to the sodium hydroxide concentration only for relatively low values, and inversely proportional to the average particle size. The final quantitative kinetic model for the leaching of skeletal cobalt with no promotion from 2.7M-10.4M NaOH concentration range where the effect of NaOH was weak was found to be: ?? ln(1- &#945; ) = [(2.8x1015&#956;m/h*exp(-72kJ/mol/(0.008314kJ/kmol*T)))/so] t With chromium promotion, the quantitative model that describes the rate of leaching in the NaOH concentration range 2.7M-10.4M was: ?? ln(1- &#945;) = [(1.5x1014&#956;m/h*exp(-74kJ/mol/(0.008314kJ/kmol*T)))/(so(C??o+0.029))] t The mechanism of leaching involves lineal or threadlike needle growth of numerous cobalt nuclei formed from the activation of correspondingly numerous alloy potential nuclei randomly distributed across the reaction interface. The mechanism involves nil ingestion/encapsulation of the alloy potential nuclei by the growing cobalt nuclei. The effect of chromate on slowing the leaching kinetics is attributed to a complex electrochemical effect. The various kinetic models proposed to date in the literature on the formation of different skeletal metal catalysts were re-analysed and consolidated to just two. Alloys of highly leachable phases, such as for skeletal copper or cobalt, follow the Avrami-Erofeev model with a time exponent of unity. Alloys with a significant amount of a less reactive alloy phase or that leach via a less reactive intermediate phase, for example skeletal nickel or silver, follow a modified Prout-Tompkins model where ingestion/encapsulation of either the alloy or intermediate phase becomes significant, leading to a lower maximum removal of aluminium from the alloy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of forest models to understand effects of elevated CO2 on aboveground forest productivity</field><field name="creator">Hazareh, Termeh, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Experiments show that forest net primary productivity (NPP) increases as atmospheric [CO2] increases. The aim of this thesis is to use process-based models to analyse the mechanisms underlying this response to atmospheric [CO2]. I used two models named MAESTRA, which is a complex model of canopy photosynthesis and MATE, a simpler model of forest carbon and water balance that is useful for long-term simulations. These models are applied to a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment on a sweetgum plantation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. In this experiment, trees growing at elevated CO2 (eCO2, 550 ppm) have a higher net primary production (NPP) than trees at ambient CO2 (aCO2, 375 ppm). The aim of my research is to understand the reasons for differences in production at aCO2 and eCO2 rings. Simulations of both models are analysed to determine whether differences between NPP at aCO2 and eCO2 are the result of changes in light use efficiency (LUE) or absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (APAR). A second question is whether the models can explain inter-year variation in NPP. The model focuses on a two-year period, 1999-2000 when extensive data are available on NPP, photosynthesis, leaf area index (LAI), and tree transpiration.  Using MAESTRA I found that: 1. Because LAI was not affected by eCO2, simulated APAR is insensitive to eCO2. Therefore enhanced total canopy photosynthesis at eCO2 is caused by increased LUE. 2. Jmax and Vcmax were slightly higher at aCO2 than in eCO2 (except for May and September 1999), indicating that photosynthesis was not down-regulated at eCO2. Values of LUE were higher in 2000 compared with 1999 at both aCO2 and eCO2. LUE was higher on days when incident PAR (IPAR) was low.  3. APAR was reduced from 1999 to 2000 due to changes in IPAR and LAI. The counter-action between reduced APAR and increased LUE cancelled each other so that NPP simulated by MAESTRA did not differ greatly from 1999 to 2000. This was in contrast with NPP data, which showed considerably higher values in 2000 than in 1999.  4. Modelled transpiration agreed well with sapflux data in mid-season at both aCO2 and eCO2 but transpiration was underestimated at start and end of year.  5. The response of simulated NPP to eCO2 was 18 and 15% in 1999 and 2000, respectively. These results compare with measured NPP responses to eCO2 of 16 and 27%, respectively.  Using MATE model I found that: 1. Simulated APAR is insensitive to eCO2, thus increased GPP at eCO2 was associated with enhanced LUE rather than enhanced APAR.  2. Simulated GPP in 2000 was higher than in 1999 due to increased LUE in 2000, despite reduced annual APAR. 3. Modelled transpiration agreed well with sapflux data at aCO2 in mid-season but underestimated transpiration at eCO2. The model underestimated transpiration at start and end of the year.  4. Simulations of plant available water showed wetter soils at eCO2.  5. Modelled NPP showed less response to eCO2 in 1999 (6% increase) than in 2000 (12% increase). These CO2 responses compare with measured NPP increases of 16 and 27% in 1999 and 2000, respectively.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linear phase filter bank design by convex programming</field><field name="creator">Ha, Hoang Kha, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Digital filter banks have found in a wide variety of applications in data compression, digital communications, and adaptive signal processing. The common objectives of the filter bank design consist of frequency selectivity of the individual filters and perfect reconstruction of the filter banks. The design problems of filter banks are intrinsically challenging because their natural formulations are nonconvex constrained optimization problems. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to cast the design problems into convex optimization problems whose globally optimal solutions can be efficiently obtained.  The main contributions of this dissertation are to exploit the convex optimization algorithms to design several classes of the filter banks. First, the two-channel orthogonal symmetric complex-valued filter banks are investigated. A key contribution is to derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of complex-valued symmetric spectral factors. Moreover, this condition can be expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and hence semi-definite programming (SDP) is applicable. Secondly, for two-channel symmetric real-valued filter banks, a more general and efficient method for designing the optimal triplet halfband filter banks with regularity is developed. By exploiting the LMI characterization of nonnegative cosine polynomials, the semi-infinite constraints can be efficiently handled. Consequently, the filter bank design is cast as an SDP problem. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the resulting filter banks are applied to image coding with improved performance. It is not straightforward to extend the proposed design methods for two-channel filter banks to M-channel filter banks. However, it is investigated that the design problem of M-channel cosine-modulated filter banks is a nonconvex optimization problem with the low degree of nonconvexity. Therefore, the efficient semidefinite relaxation technique is proposed to design optimal prototype filters. Additionally, a cheap iterative algorithm is developed to further improve the performance of the filter banks.  Finally, the application of filter banks to multicarrier systems is considered. The condition on the transmit filter bank and channel for the existence of zero-forcing filter bank equalizers is obtained. A closed-form expression of the optimal equalizer is then derived. The proposed filter bank transceivers are shown to outperform the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Semidefinite programming</field><field name="subject">Filter banks</field><field name="subject">Convex optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Form, function, phylogeny and biogeography of enigmatic Australian metatherians</field><field name="creator">Beck, Robin Michael Davenport, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A molecular phylogeny of marsupials based on a 20.1 kb nuclear and mitochondrial supermatrix, with associated divergence dates calculated using a Bayesian ??relaxed?? molecular clock approach, is presented. Monophyly of the currently recognised orders, Australidelphia and a clade comprising Dasyuromorphia, Notoryctes, and Peramelemorphia is strongly supported; the name Agreodontia is proposed for the latter clade. The molecular divergence dates indicate that the interordinal divergences within Marsupialia occurred during the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene, and that several groups within the Australian radiation radiated during periods of significant environmental change in the Miocene. The fossil record of didelphids and most Australian marsupial groups appears to be particularly incomplete. Based on information provided by isolated petrosals and tarsals referred to this taxon, the early Eocene Australian metatherian Djarthia murgonensis appears to be the most plesiomorphic undoubted australidelphian and the oldest known crown-group marsupial from Australia. The presence of microbiotherians in South America may be the result of a back-dispersal from Australia or elsewhere in eastern Gondwana.  A qualitative functional analysis of the craniodental anatomy of the Oligo-Miocene Australian metatherian Yalkaparidon supports the hypothesis that this taxon was probably a ??mammalian woodpecker??, similar to Daubentonia, Dactylopsila, and the extinct apatemyids. The craniodental anatomy of Yalkaparidon is described in detail, and isolated astragali and calcanea are tentatively referred to the genus. Yalkaparidon appears to be a member of Australidelphia but without close relationships to any other australidelphian order. The order Yalkaparidontia is maintained, and revised ordinal and species-level diagnoses are presented. A revised phylogenetic definition for Marsupialia is proposed. Numbigilga ernielundeliusi, a bunodont metatherian from the early Pliocene of northeastern Queensland, is described, and the distribution of bunodont dental characters within Metatheria is reviewed. An overview of Gondwanan metatherian biogeography is presented. It is argued that current evidence supports only limited dispersal of metatherians between South America and Australia during the Late Cretaceous or early Palaeogene, and that this was largely due to dispersal barriers (climatic and environmental) present within the Antarctic mainland. Future priorities for a better understanding of metatherian evolution and the origin of the modern Australian marsupial fauna are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatially reconfigurable and non-parametric representation of dynamic bayesian beliefs</field><field name="creator">Lavis, Benjamin Mark, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a means for representing and computing beliefs in the form of arbitrary probability density functions with a guarantee for the ongoing validity of such beliefs over indefinte time frames. The foremost aspect of this proposal is the introduction of a general, theoretical, solution to the guaranteed state estimation problem from within the recursive Bayesian estimation framework. The solution presented here determines the minimum space required, at each stage of the estimation process, to represent the belief with limited, or no, loss of information.  Beyond this purely theoretical aspect, a number of numerical techniques, capable of determining the required space and performing the appropriate spatial reconfiguration, whilst also computing and representing the belief functions, are developed. This includes a new, hybrid particle-element approach to recursive Bayesian estimation.  The advantage of spatial reconfiguration as presented here is that it ensures that the belief functions consider all plausible states of the target system, without altering the recursive Bayesian estimation equations used to form those beliefs. Furthermore, spatial reconfiguration as proposed in this dissertation enhances the estimation process since it allows computational resources to be concentrated on only those states considered plausible.  Autonomous maritime search and rescue is used as a focus application throughout this dissertation since the searching-and-tracking requirements of the problem involve uncertainty, the use of arbitrary belief functions and dynamic target systems. Nevertheless, the theoretical development in this dissertation has been kept general and independent of an application, and as such the theory and techniques presented here may be applied to any problem involving dynamic Bayesian beliefs.  A number of numerical experiments and simulations show the efficacy of the proposed spatially reconfigurable representations, not only in ensuring the validity of the belief functions over indefinite time frames, but also in reducing computation time and improving the accuracy of function approximation. Improvements of an order of magnitude were achieved when compared with traditional, spatially static representations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hybrid Particle-Element Approach</field><field name="subject">Probabilistic Robotics</field><field name="subject">Recursive Bayesian Estimation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative analysis of T-cell repertoire for relevance to non-progressive HIV infection</field><field name="creator">van Bockel, David John, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are important for the control of viral replication during HIV infection, however the magnitude and breadth of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell response does not correlate well. The purpose for this study was the examination of the HLA-B*2705-specific CD8+ T-cell response to the KRWIILGLNK (KK10) epitope as a definitive model of immune control over HIV replication. The breadth of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was determined for an association between the qualitative nature of this response and immune escape and therefore, disease progression. Methodology was developed and validated for TCR repertoire analysis in formaldehyde fixed antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. The TCR repertoire for the KK10-specific CD8+ T-cell response was defined in cross-section and longitudinally for 6 HLA-B*2705+ patients. Comparison was made to cognate HLA-A*0201 CMV NV9 and HLA-B*2705 EBV RL9-specific CD8+ T-cell populations using the Simpson??s diversity index and the Morisita-Horn similarity index for standardized repertoire analysis. HLA-B*2705 KK10-specific TCR repertoire was not found to be a determinant of control. Greater clonotype variation was found within CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell populations, suggesting an association with reactivation of CMV and disease state. An association was found between KK10-specific population diversity and the prevalence of cognate KK10 epitope in vivo. Cross-reactivity observed for dominant KK10-specific clonotypes suggested that avidity of CD8+ T-cells was important for in vivo survival. Phenotype and function was tested through multiparameter analysis of HIV and CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells. Increased frequency of CD127 (IL-7R) and Bcl-2 expression within dominant populations was suggestive of selective advantage. Division of dominant and sub-dominant CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell populations into ??early?? and ??late?? differentiation phenotypes indicated virus-specific mechanisms of clonotype turn over. No simple association of TCR expression was found for HIV and CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells with published examples of definitive TCR bias. Over-represented TCR ??-chain families of patients were found in association with public clonotypes. Convergent recombination of TCR genes was demonstrated as a mechanism for the prevalence of shared clonotypes. Standardized assessment of T-cell repertoire successfully identified mechanisms of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell recruitment. A substantial increase in sample numbers is required before this methodology can be used to accurately demonstrate the importance of TCR repertoire usage in the control of human viral infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TCR</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">T-cell</field><field name="subject">CD8</field><field name="subject">LTNP</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PECVD silicon nitride for n-type silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Chen, Wan Lam Florence, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cost of crystalline silicon solar cells must be reduced in order for photovoltaics to be widely accepted as an economically viable means of electricity generation and be used on a larger scale across the world. There are several ways to achieve cost reduction, such as using thinner silicon substrates, lowering the thermal budget of the processes, and improving the efficiency of solar cells. This thesis examines the use of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited silicon nitride to address the criteria of cost reduction for n-type crystalline silicon solar cells. It focuses on the surface passivation quality of silicon nitride on n-type silicon, and injection-level dependent lifetime data is used extensively in this thesis to evaluate the surface passivation quality of the silicon nitride films. The thesis covers several aspects, spanning from characterisation and modelling, to process development, to device integration. The thesis begins with a review on the advantages of using n-type silicon for solar cells applications, with some recent efficiency results on n-type silicon solar cells and a review on various interdigitated backside contact structures, and key results of surface passivation for n-type silicon solar cells. It then presents an analysis of the influence of various parasitic effects on lifetime data, highlighting how these parasitic effects could affect the results of experiments that use lifetime data extensively. A plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition process for depositing silicon nitride films is developed to passivate both diffused and non-diffused surfaces for n-type silicon solar cells application. Photoluminescence imaging, lifetime measurements, and optical microscopy are used to assess the quality of the silicon nitride films. An open circuit voltage of 719 mV is measured on an n-type, 1 &#8486;.cm, FZ, voltage test structure that has direct passivation by silicon nitride. Dark saturation current densities of 5 to 15 fA/cm2 are achieved on SiN-passivated boron emitters that have sheet resistances ranging from 60 to 240 &#8486;/&#9633; after thermal annealing. Using the process developed, a more profound study on surface passivation by silicon nitride is conducted, where the relationship between the surface passivation quality and the film composition is investigated. It is demonstrated that the silicon-nitrogen bond density is an important parameter to achieve good surface pas-sivation and thermal stability. With the developed process and deeper understanding on the surface passivation of silicon nitride, attempts of integrating the process into the fab-rication of all-SiN passivated n-type IBC solar cells and laser doped n-type IBC solar cells are presented. Some of the limitations, inter-relationships, requirements, and challenges of novel integration of SiN into these solar cell devices are identified. Finally, a novel metallisation scheme that takes advantages of the different etching and electroless plating properties of different PECVD SiN films is described, and a preliminary evalua-tion is presented. This metallisation scheme increases the metal finger width without increasing the metal contact area with the underlying silicon, and also enables optimal distance between point contacts for point contact solar cells. It is concluded in this thesis that plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited silicon nitride is well-suited for n-type silicon solar cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">n-type solar cells</field><field name="subject">PECVD</field><field name="subject">Silicon nitride</field><field name="subject">Surface passivation</field><field name="subject">Laser processing</field><field name="subject">Photoluminescence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of combined failure mechanisms in large scale open pit slopes</field><field name="creator">Franz, Juergen, Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Failure mechanisms in large scale open pit slopes are more complex than could be considered through conventional slope design methods. Pit slope behaviour must be predicted accurately, because for very deep open pits, a small change of slope angle can have serious technical and economic consequences. Failure of hard rock slopes often involves both failure along naturally existing weakness planes and failure of intact rock. Without an advanced understanding of combined rock slope failure mechanisms, the validity of commonly applied methods of large scale slope analysis is questionable. The problem was investigated by means of a toolbox approach, in which a wide range of slope stability analysis methods were used and compared to address specific problems arising during slope design optimisation of the Cadia Hill Open Pit, NSW. In particular, numerical modelling is an advanced tool to obtain insight into potential failure mechanisms and to assist the slope design process. The distinct element method was employed to simulate complex rock slope failure, including fracture extension, progressive step-path failure and brittle failure propagation, which were previously often considered unimportant or too difficult to model. A new, failure-scale-dependent concept for the categorisation of slope failures with six categories ranging from 0 (stable) to 5 (overall slope failure) was suggested to assist risk-based slope design. Parametric slope modelling was conducted to determine the interrelationship between proposed categories and critical slope/discontinuity parameters. Initiation and progression of complex slope failure were simulated and described, which resulted in an advanced understanding of combined slope failure mechanisms and the important role of rock bridges in large scale slope stability. A graphical presentation of the suggested slope failure categories demonstrated their interrelationship to varied slope/discontinuity parameters. Although large scale slope analyses will always involve data-limited systems, this investigation shows that comprehensive, conceptual modelling of slope failure mechanisms can deliver a significantly improved insight into slope behaviour, so that associated slope failure risks can be judged with more confidence. The consideration of combined slope failure mechanisms in the analysis of large scale open pit slopes is essential if slope behaviour is to be realistically modelled.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slope modelling</field><field name="subject">combined slope failure mechanism</field><field name="subject">large scale open pit slope</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SEATO and the defence of Southeast Asia 1955-1965</field><field name="creator">Fenton, Damien , Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the role played by the South East Treaty Organisation (SEATO) in the defence of Western interests in that region during the Cold War, there has to date been no scholarly attempt to examine the development and performance of the organisation as a military alliance. This thesis is thus the first attempt to do so and as such seeks to take advantage of the recent release of much SEATO-related official material into the public domain by Western governments. This material throws new light upon SEATO???s aims and achievements, particularly in regard to the first ten years of its existence. Because SEATO was eventually rendered irrelevant by the events of the Second Indochina War (1965-1975) a popular perception has arisen that it was always a ???Paper Tiger??? lacking in substance, and thus easily dismissed. This thesis challenges this assumption by examining SEATO???s development in the decade before that conflict.  The thesis analyses SEATO???s place in the wider Cold War and finds that it was part of a rational and consistent response within the broader Western strategy of containment to deter, and if need be, defeat, the threat of communist aggression. That threat was a very real one for Southeast Asia in the aftermath of the First Indochina War and one that was initially perceived in terms of the conventional military balance of power. This focus dominated SEATO???s strategic concepts and early contingency planning and rightly so, as an examination of the strength and development of the PLA and PAVN during this period demonstrates. SEATO developed a dedicated military apparatus, principally the Military Planning Office (MPO), that proved itself to be perfectly capable of providing the level of co-ordination and planning needed to produce a credible SEATO deterrent in this regard. SEATO enjoyed less success with its attempts to respond to the emergence of a significant communist insurgent threat, first in Laos then in South Vietnam, but the alliance did nonetheless recognise this threat and the failure of SEATO in this regard was one of political will rather than military doctrine. Indeed this thesis confirms that it was the increasingly disparate political agendas of a number of SEATO???s members that ultimately paralysed its ability to act and thus ensured its failure to meet its aims, at least insofar as the so-called ???Protocol States??? were concerned. But this failure should not be allowed to completely overshadow SEATO???s earlier achievements in providing a modicum of Western-backed stability and security to the region from 1955-1965.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Politics, 1955-1965</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation : history</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia : foreign relations</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia : defenses</field><field name="subject">Communism : Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">SEATO</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palaeoecological and biochronological studies of Riversleigh, world heritage property, Oligo-Miocene fossil localities, north-western Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Travouillon, Kenny James, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Riversleigh, World Heritage Property, located in North-western Queensland, Australia, contains over 200 fossil bearing localities from the Oligo-Miocene.

It is a challenge that is not only of interest for the construction of AI agents, but is of equal importance in the modelling of agent behaviour. The goal of this thesis is to contribute to the formalisation of agent reasoning by showing that the computational limitations of agents is a vital component of modelling rational behaviour. To achieve this aim, both motivational and formal aspects of resource-bounded agents are examined.  It is a central argument of this thesis that accounting for computational limitations is critical to the success of agent reasoning, yet has received only limited attention from the broader research community. Consequently, an important contribution of this thesis is in its advancing of motivational arguments in support of the need to account for computational limitations in agent reasoning research.  As a natural progression from the motivational arguments, the majority of this thesis is devoted to an examination of propositional approximate logics. These logics represent a step towards the development of resource-bounded agents, but are also applicable to other areas of automated reasoning.  This thesis makes a number of contributions in mapping the space of approximate logics. In particular, it draws a connection between approximate logics and knowledge compilation, by developing an approximate knowledge compilation method based on Cadoli and Schaerf??s S-3 family of approximate logics. This method allows for the incremental compilation of a knowledge base, thus reducing the need for a costly recompilation process. Furthermore, each approximate compilation has well-defined logical properties due to its correspondence to a particular S-3 logic. Important contributions are also made in the examination of approximate logics for clausal reasoning. Clausal reasoning is of particular interest due to the efficiency of modern clausal satisfiability solvers and the related research into problem hardness. In particular, Finger's Logics of Limited Bivalence are shown to be applicable to clausal reasoning. This is subsequently shown to logically characterise the behaviour of the well-known DPLL algorithm for determining boolean satisfiability, when subjected to restricted branching.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rational Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Approximate logics</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Agents</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular studies of the response of Helicobacter hepaticus to bile, and the effect of Helicobacter bilis on human hepatoma cells</field><field name="creator">Okoli, Arinze Stanley, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Enterohepatic Helicobacter species (EHS) are emerging infectious disease agents. Infection of the enterohepatobiliary tract of several mammals by this group of bacteria results in various pathological disorders. The availability of the Helicobacter hepaticus sequenced and annotated genome, allowed molecular characterisation of the responses of H. hepaticus to host factors such as bile. The adaptation/responses of the bacterium to bovine, porcine and human bile were investigated using proteomics and transcriptomics. Ninety-one different proteins were identified in the responses of H. hepaticus response to the three types of bile. These proteins participate in several key cellular processes including DNA replication; protein transcription, translation and folding; oxidative stress response; motility; virulence; and metabolism. In particular, the bacteria deployed several strategies such as inhibition of the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain as well as iron sequestration to ensure control of the levels of hydroxyl radicals. The results of this study revealed also the modulation by bile of the expression of H. hepaticus genes involved in response to oxidative stress and virulence. The responses of human HEp-2 and Huh7-derived cell-lines to H. hepaticus and Helicobacter bilis, respectively, were investigated employing proteomics and transcriptomics. One-hundred and twenty different proteins were differentially expressed in the responses of the human cells to the presence of Helicobacter spp. in the cell cultures. These proteins are involved in regulation of cell proliferation and structure; metabolism; protein transcription, translation and modification; stress response; and tumour induction. For example, in co-cultures of Huh7-derived cells and H. bilis, the activation of several mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins and the dysregulation of several apoptosis effectors were suggested as mechanisms that could result in the death of the liver cells. Importantly, the differential expression of several tumour-related proteins by the Huh7 cells supported a possible role for Helicobacter spp. in liver cancer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter hepaticus</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter bilis</field><field name="subject">Molecular</field><field name="subject">Bile</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Liver</field><field name="subject">2D-PAGE</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of factors in simulation of parking guidance and information systems</field><field name="creator">Peng, Wendi, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Parking Guidance and Information (PGI) system is an important application of Intelligent Transport System (ITS), which has been shown to be an effect service for traffic information and parking management. The roadside Variable Message Sign (VMS) board has been the usual media for the publication of parking information in early PGI systems, and its performance over the years has been studied via simulations and questionnaire surveys. However, survey results show significant discrepancies across various traffic networks in different areas. More recently, parking information services have become available on other media such as mobile and in-vehicle devices. In contrast to VMS-based systems, PGI systems based on new media, especially the in-vehicle class of devices, have not been studied separately. This thesis aims to conduct research into the performance of PGI systems based on invehicle devices, by simulating and comparing a VMS-based PGI system with a Vehicle On-Board Device (VOBD)-based PGI system. A specially designed simulator utilising a routing algorithm known as the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in computer networks, has been created in MATLAB. The simulation minimises the influence of specific structures of traffic networks that may be found in some networks, but not others. This is done by simulating a grid-based road network where the capacities of parking stations and their geographic distribution are randomly allocated within specific zones, and the parking demand in each run of simulations is variable load. The results of simulations, including the information reliability, reduction of travel time, demand on on-street parking and the utilisation rates of parking stations, are analysed for multiple scenarios where the compliance rate, the information update policy and the strategy of human behaviour are varied. The analyses reveal a significant advantage of VOBD-based PGI systems over VMS-based PGI systems in terms of the quality of information and the reduction of travel time. At the same time, the analyses highlight the limitations of a PGI system when the demand and supply of parking stations is not appropriately balanced.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ITS</field><field name="subject">PGI</field><field name="subject">Parking guidance and information</field><field name="subject">Intelligent transport system</field><field name="subject">VMS</field><field name="subject">Variable message sign</field><field name="subject">Vehicle on-board device</field><field name="subject">VOBD</field><field name="subject">MATLAB</field><field name="subject">AODV</field><field name="subject">Ad hoc on-demand distance vector</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location tracking architectures for wireless VoIP</field><field name="creator">Shah, Zawar, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A research area that has recently gained great interest is the development of network architectures relating to the tracking of wireless VoIP devices. This is particularly so for architectures based on the popular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Previous work, however, in this area does not consider the impact of combined VoIP and tracking on the capacity and call set-up time of the architectures. Previous work also assumes that location information is always available from sources such as GPS, a scenario that rarely is found in practice. The inclusion of multiple positioning systems in tracking architectures has not been hitherto explored. It is the purpose of this thesis to design and test SIP-based architectures that address these key issues.  Our first main contribution is the development of a tracking-only SIP based architecture. This architecture is designed for intermittent GPS availability, with wireless network tracking as the back-up positioning technology. Such a combined tracking system is more conducive with deployment in real-world environments.  Our second main contribution is the development of SIP based tracking architectures that are specifically aimed at mobile wireless VoIP systems. A key aspect we investigate is the quantification of the capacity constraints imposed on VoIP-tracking architectures. We identify such capacity limits in terms of SIP call setup time and VoIP QoS metrics, and determine these limits through experimental measurement and theoretical analyses.  Our third main contribution is the development of a novel SIP based location tracking architecture in which the VoIP application is modified. The key aspect of this architecture is the factor of two increase in capacity that it can accommodate relative to architectures utilizing standard VoIP.  An important aspect of all our tracking architectures is the Tracking Server. This server supplies the location information in the event of GPS unavailability. A final contribution of this thesis is the development of novel particle-filter based tracking algorithms that specifically address the GPS intermittency issue. We show how these filters interact with other features of our SIP based architectures in a seamless fashion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Network architectures</field><field name="subject">Location tracking</field><field name="subject">Voice over IP</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inconsistencies and resistance: Japanese husbands?? views on employment of married women</field><field name="creator">Usuda, Akiko, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates Japanese married men??s views on their wives?? employment and married women??s employment in general. I was inspired to undertake this study by the relatively low rate of wives, particularly mothers, in full-time employment in Japan. 291 Japanese husbands in Kawasaki and the Tokyo area answered the questionnaire. Their occupations were company employees, teachers and self-employed men and their ages ranged from the 20s to 50s. The results of my survey revealed that these Japanese husbands did not actively participate in housework and childcare. Their participation increased somewhat when wives were highly educated or older. However, a wife??s higher income was the most powerful incentive to encourage their participation. Husbands also participate in these tasks in accordance with their preferences rather than their expressed abilities. With respect to their views on married women and employment, many husbands acknowledged a general relationship between power and finance (that is, that income-earning is connected with domestic power), yet denied that it applied to themselves when asked about it. The majority showed supportive or sympathetic attitudes towards full-time housewives, which were rarely extended to employed wives except for those who work (part-time) due to clear financial necessity.  Concerning men??s views on their wives, they were likely to appreciate a wife??s additional income. Nonetheless, a majority wanted their wives either to earn less than themselves or to have no income, even though the majority had income-earning wives. Their most popular employment status for a wife was part-time employment. The study revealed that most of these husbands had a strong identity as the ??breadwinner?? or ??head of the house??.  In this study I explored a new dimension to Japanese husbands?? perceptions of their wives?? employment: the possibility that husbands?? attitudes and preferences were militating against their wives?? employment. My study demonstrated that husbands especially resist full-time employment for their wives, and seek to maintain traditional gender roles because this sustains their self-esteem. This is clearly one significant reason for the comparatively low rate of participation of Japanese wives in full-time employment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender role</field><field name="subject">Japanese men</field><field name="subject">wife's employment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A computable overlapping generation model (OLG) of Chinese pension reform</field><field name="creator">Yi, Xin, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a computable Overlapping Generation (OLG) model to examine the Chinese pension reform. The research involves two steps: calibrating an OLG model for the Chinese economy; and undertaking policy evaluations. Model calibration involves choosing a set of household and firm parameters to capture the key features of the Chinese economy and pension system. Policy evaluation involves using the calibrated model to compare economic variables under alterative pension policies.  The major pension policy focus is a comparison of Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) and full funded social security designs. The thesis examines the effect of pension reform on the economy from both economy-wide and inter-generational dimensions. On the economy-wide variables, the thesis finds that economic outputs would eventually (at steady state level) increase substantially if the pension system switched to full-funding from a PAYG scheme. This outcome mainly results from the difference in capital stock under alterative pension schemes, as the thesis assumes labor inputs and technological progress grow exogenously. On the inter-generational aspect, the results from the thesis suggest that if pension reform occurred, household wages would be much higher than under the PAYG scheme, which is taken to be the existing policy structure, as would lifetime income and household saving. I find that consumption initially declines at the time of reform, but recovers to a higher level. Finally the thesis concludes that the utility of the generation born just before pension reform would fall by between 0.4 and 0.6 percent, but the utility of future generations would eventually increase by between 2.4 and 4.3 percent.  Based on the simulation results the thesis argues for two conclusions. Firstly, China??s economic output would increase if the pension reform occurred, as the capital stock under the full funded scheme is higher than under the PAYG scheme. Secondly, the thesis finds that the losers are the older generation at the time of the pension reform but that all other generations would benefit from the reform.

This study looked at the personal computer's impact on the public library's services and functions.  Particular attention was paid to the public access personal computer.  The method involved a Baseline survey to establish the availability and use of public access personal computers in Australian public libraries and a Delphi survey to consider possible futures.  The researcher's framework was drawn from reviews of the literatures on futures research;  new information technology and its social impacts;  the development and current situation of the public library;  and innovation research.  The Baseline survey revealed that public access personal computers were becoming increasingly common in public libraries, though their provision was not yet widespread.  Existing and planned uses included games, literacy and various other educational activities.  Overall the public access personal computer was viewed as a favourable innovation with the part it could play in developing community computer literacy receiving particular attention.  The Delphi panel was comprised of 25 public librarians selected on the basis of their knowledge about computers in public libraries.  The 41 Event Statements postulated a wide range of changes in - (1) the nature and method of service provision;  (2) the patterns of client demand and use; and,  (3) financial allocations.  The results revealed greater variability of opinion about the likely time of occurrence of the Events than about their desirability. A high level of opinion change between the two Rounds did not produce much movement toward consensus - indicating that the panel had varied views of the future.  Comment on both surveys indicated that the librarians were keen to develop services relevant to their communities and if public access personal computers were such a service they would strive to provide them.

In the surveyed regions, the warabandi system was performing poorly. In-built rigidity in water allocations was found as main reason behind its poor performance. The results from the farmers?? surveys also revealed that the objective of increasing irrigation water productivity would never be attained under the warabandi arrangements. Hence, a completely new concept that could replace the warabandi system and improve the productivity of limited irrigation water should be introduced. My aim was to find a better way to allocate the scarce water resource between farmers. In this study, I have introduced a new concept for determining water allocations among the farmers, which is based on a multicriterion decision making (MCDM) approach. The consideration of multiple criteria in irrigation water allocations would improve irrigation water productivity. Upon an extensive survey of well-known MCDM methods, I concluded that all previously existing MCDM methods were using subjective inputs, usually from a single modeller, to establish priorities of alternatives and therefore, a predetermined solution could easily be obtained. I have developed an approach based on conjoint analysis which removes that subjectivity from the chosen MCDM method (i.e. ELECTRE). Interval scales and relative importance criteria weights, two usually subjective inputs in ELECTRE, are objectively estimated from the conjoint analysis study. For that purpose, the author designed a conjoint questionnaire and administered it to 62 farmer respondents in face-to-face interviews. Conjoint analysis, which does not appear to have been previously used in water resources or allocation studies, is a method for creating the interval scales and the relative criteria weights objectively from the respondents?? judgements on the importance of conjoint objects. The objective estimation of these two important factors is a completely new development which can assist in the unbiased determination of the best division or allocation of scarce water resources between farmers. The approach is applied, as a demonstration, to a region with nine distributary watercourses to determine which of the distributaries should have the highest priority for allocation of the regional water.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multicriterion Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Rotational Irrigation Delivery System</field><field name="subject">The warabandi</field><field name="subject">ELECTRE</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="subject">Pakistan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The new scientific eyewitness: The role of DNA profiling in shaping criminal justice</field><field name="creator">Wise, Jenny Alice, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since its first use in criminal investigations in 1987, DNA profiling has become the new gold standard for investigations and prosecutions. Academics, politicians and law enforcement officials have presented DNA evidence as a ??scientific hero?? that is capable of solving crimes and preventing miscarriages of justice. However, in spite of this reputation, few studies have explored the impact of this technology on criminal justice practitioners, or on the process of investigating and processing criminal offences. This dissertation provides a comparative study of the use of DNA profiling in two jurisdictions: New South Wales (NSW) in Australia and the Thames Valley in the United Kingdom (UK). Interviews canvassed the perspectives and experiences of police officers, scene of crime officers (SOCOs), forensic scientists, criminal lawyers, and judicial officers from these areas. These interviews were analysed in conjunction with appeal judgments and police statistics to reveal how DNA evidence has been used in the NSW and Thames Valley. The research presented in this dissertation indicates that DNA profiling is having a number of far-reaching effects on both criminal justice systems and is seen as a reliable forensic tool by criminal justice practitioners. Practitioners routinely use DNA evidence throughout the various stages of the criminal justice process and are actively changing their practices to utilise the technology more effectively. One of the main impacts of the introduction of DNA evidence into criminal investigations has been the need to provide substantial resources and infrastructure for the collection, analysis, and storage of samples. Both jurisdictions encountered a number of problems because they provided insufficient resources to effectively use DNA profiling. This study also offers insight into how criminal justice practitioners perceive the dangers of using DNA evidence and how miscarriages of justice can occur. Finally, through an analysis of the combined experiences of criminal justice practitioners, this dissertation challenges the widespread acceptance and routine use of forensic DNA profiling. It further suggests that it is now time to re-consider current practices in relation to how resources are devoted to the technology, and how criminal justice practitioners are using the technology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA evidence</field><field name="subject">criminal justice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scanline calculation of radial influence for image processing</field><field name="creator">Ilbery, Peter William Mitchell, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Efficient methods for the calculation of radial influence are described and applied to two image processing problems, digital halftoning and mixed content image compression. The methods operate recursively on scanlines of image values, spreading intensity from scanline to scanline in  proportions approximating a Cauchy distribution.  For error diffusion halftoning, experiments show that this recursive scanline spreading provides an ideal pattern of distribution of error. Error diffusion using masks generated to provide this distribution of error alleviate error diffusion "worm" artifacts.  The recursive scanline by scanline application of a spreading filter and a complementary filter can be used to reconstruct an image from its horizontal and vertical pixel difference values. When combined with the use of a downsampled image the reconstruction is robust to incomplete and quantized pixel difference data. Such gradient field integration methods are described in detail proceeding from representation of images by gradient values along contours through to a variety of efficient algorithms.  Comparisons show that this form of gradient field integration by convolution provides reduced distortion compared to other high speed gradient integration methods. The reduced distortion can be attributed to success in approximating a radial pattern of influence. An approach to edge-based image compression is proposed using integration of gradient data along edge contours and regularly sampled low resolution image data. This edge-based image compression model is similar to previous sketch based image coding methods but allows a simple and efficient calculation of an edge-based approximation image.  A low complexity implementation of this approach to compression is described. The implementation extracts and represents gradient data along edge contours as pixel differences and calculates an approximate image by performing integration of pixel difference data by scanline convolution. The implementation was developed as a prototype for compression of mixed content image data in printing systems. Compression results are reported and strengths and weaknesses of the implementation are identified.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="subject">halftoning</field><field name="subject">image compression</field><field name="subject">image representation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of self-regulatory aids on autonomous study</field><field name="creator">Bednall, Timothy Colin, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis tested whether encouraging the use of self-regulatory learning strategies enhances the effectiveness of autonomous study for novices in a learning domain. Previous research and theory have suggested that high-achieving students are proficient at self-regulating their learning, and they do so using a range of learning strategies for planning their study, monitoring the effectiveness of their efforts and elaborating their knowledge. Information processing theories of instructional design suggest that learning is optimal when working memory load is managed effectively. Accordingly, methods have been devised for reducing load associated with unnecessary task requirements, as well as dedicating additional capacity to the construction and automation of knowledge schemas. Less is known, however, about instructional methods for encouraging self-regulatory learning strategies. Experiments 1, 2 and 4 examined the effect of encouraging participants to reflect on their understanding of topics they had been taught previously. Although these participants were able to accurately estimate their level of understanding in some situations, they failed to consistently use this knowledge to guide their study of topics they had previously understood poorly. In light of this finding, Experiments 3 and 5 examined the effect of encouraging participants to plan a free study period, with the direction to prioritise the topics that they had understood the least well. This intervention had a modest positive effect on post-test performance. Experiment 6 examined the effect of encouraging two elaborative strategies, namely explanation generation and summarisation. The former benefited performance, whereas the effectiveness of the latter depended on the comprehensiveness of the summaries produced by the participants. Finally, Experiment 7 examined the effect of providing broad-spectrum instruction in learning strategies, with minimal requirements to engage in specific strategies. This intervention resulted in an overall benefit to performance. Overall, the results of this dissertation suggest that certain instructional aids for self-regulation yield benefits to the autonomous study by domain novices without overburdening working memory.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Self-regulated learning</field><field name="subject">Cognitive processes</field><field name="subject">Learning strategies</field><field name="subject">Teaching methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family Size and Relative Need</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Bruce William, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines three questions concerned with the relative income needs of families of different sizes - often summarised by indices known as ???equivalence scales???. The first is the extent to which researchers and policy makers should offset the costs of family composition (eg the expenditure costs of children) with the benefits associated with demographic choice (eg the ???joys of parenthood???). Chapter 2 concludes that there are demographic and financial market constraints that will often make a narrow focus on expenditure costs appropriate for distributional research and tax/transfer policies. However, this will not always be the case. One implication of this result is that it may be reasonable for distributional research to use different equivalence scales for adults and children in the same household. Part 2 of the thesis introduces a new method for the estimation of the within-household income distribution and expenditure costs of different family types. This is based upon the household welfare model of Samuelson together with Lau???s method for modelling the joint consumption of household goods. In Chapter 4, this method is applied to the estimation of equivalence scales for older singles and married couples. The estimation is based upon a detailed set of assumptions about the extent of joint consumption for 17 different commodity groups. The main conclusions are that: the theoretical model fits the observed behaviour well (with the exception of some home production effects); that aged couples share their income relatively evenly; and that the relative rate of pension for aged singles in Australia is probably too low. In Part 3, the thesis examines how changes in poverty can be estimated when there is uncertainty about the equivalence scale. The thesis proposes a new method which permits a set of upper and lower bounds for the equivalence scale to be assumed, which in turn determine upper and lower bounds for the increase in poverty. This method is applied to measure the change in poverty in Australia during the 1980s. Equivalence scales can be found that imply either an increase or a decrease in poverty.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer equivalence scales</field><field name="subject">poverty</field><field name="subject">living standards</field><field name="subject">household welfare</field><field name="subject">intra-household allocation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser Crystallisation of Silicon for Photovoltaic Applications using Copper Vapour Lasers</field><field name="creator">Boreland, Matt, School of Electrical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin film silicon on low temperature glass substrates is currently seen as the best path toreduce the $/W cost of photovoltaic (PV) modules. However, producing thin film polysilicon, on glass, is an ongoing research challenge. Laser crystallisation of a-Si is one of the possible methods.  Typically excimer (XMR) lasers are used for laser crystallisation. This thesis introduces the copper vapour laser (CVL) as a viable alternative for thin film photovoltaic applications. The CVL, like the XMR, is a high powered, pulsed laser. However, the CVL has higher pulse rates (4-20kHz), better beam quality and a visible wavelength output (578 &amp; 511nm). Preliminary experiments, using 600K-heated silicon-on-quartz samples, confirmed that CVL crystallisation can produce area weighted average grain size of 0.1-0.15??m, which is comparable to results reported for XMR??? s. Importantly, the CVL results used thicker films (1??m), which is more applicable to thin photovoltaic devices that need 1-10??m of silicon to be viable. The CVL??? s longer wavelength and therefore longer penetration depth (1/alpha) are proffered as the main reason for this result.  Extensive laser-thermal modelling highlighted further opportunities specific to CVL crystallisation. Through-the-glass doublesided irradiation was shown in simulations to reduce thermal gradients, which would enhance crystal growth. The simulations also produced deeper melts at lower surface temperatures, reducing the thermal stress on the sample. Subsequent experiments, using silicon-on-glass, confirmed the benefit of through-the-glass doublesided irradiation by maintaining grain sizes without the usual need for substrate heating. Furthermore, Raman analysis showed that doublesided crystallisation achieved full depth crystallisation, unlike single side irradiation which produced partial crystallisation.  A new mode of crystallisation, stepwise crystallisation, was also postulated whereby a series of CVL pulses could be used to incrementally increase the crystallisation depth into the silicon. Simulations confirmed the theoretical basis of the concept, with HeNe Raman spectroscopy and analysis of surface grain sizes providing indirect experimental support.  The CVL??? s ability to crystallise thicker films more directly applicable to photovoltaic devices secures its viability as an alternative laser for photovoltaic applications. The through-the-glass doublesided irradiation and the stepwise crystallisation provide additional potential for increased process flexibility over XMR???s.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">photovoltaic</field><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="subject">laser crystallisation</field><field name="subject">copper vapour laser</field><field name="subject">laser thermal modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation of subject literature collection for bibliometric analysis: the case of the topic of Bradford's Law of Scattering</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Concepci??n Shimizu, School of Information, Library &amp; Archive Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study develops a general procedure for forming a well-defined collection of documents on a research topic, which is suitable for bibliometric analysis.  The procedure is applied to one research topic in Library and Information Science, Bradford's Law of Scattering.  An analysis is made of the underlying concepts, viz. 'document', 'selection', 'collection comprehensiveness', 'topic', 'research topic', and 'on' and 'relevant to' a research topic.  An important distinction is drawn between graphical and semantic attributes of documents, and between their modes of analysis.  The central problem of the study is that, while 'topic' is a problematic semantic attribute of documents, a well-defined collection of documents requires a selection criterion formulated on unproblematic graphical attributes.  The solution proposed is to let specialist A&amp;I Services legitimate a research topic and to provide a sample of its documents; then to extract a diagnostic graphical pattern from the sample, and from this construct a criterion which can be mechanically applied to all documents.  Modifications introduced into the general procedure include the iterative development of the criterion from the growing collection, and allowing a content analysis of documents to suggest diagnostic patterns in the text.  The graphical selection criterion developed for the specific collection was composed of six alternative pairs of word-stems separated by at most two words in the body of the text of documents.  It has an estimated precision of 96% against the background literature and retrieves 90% of all known documents which might be judged to be on the topic.  The final collection consists of 1187 analytical-level and scholarly documents written in 19 languages; it is well-defined, accords with convention, and is judged to be near completion for documents more strongly on and influential in the topic.  Inadequacies in the procedure and in the collection formed were examined and improvements have been suggested.  For example, the mixing of semantic and graphical methods in the pattern extraction process is clarified, recall can be enhanced by the addition of several small sub-collections, and measures of topic aboutness and topic influence were installed in the collection.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bibliometrics</field><field name="subject">Bradford's Law of Scattering</field><field name="subject">collection formation</field><field name="subject">subject literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eutrophication and excessive Macroalgal growth in Lake Macquarie, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Nicholls, David John, School of Biological Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In response to concern that excessive macroalgal growth and accumulation was occurring in some inshore areas of Lake Macquarie, the distribution, abundance and seasonality of macroalgae was investigated in relation to nutrient input and power station cooling water. Macroalgal dry weight biomass was measured at ten sites on a monthly basis for two years, with an analysis of community structure conducted using Multi-Dimensional Scaling. The macroalgal community in Lake Macquarie was typical of those found in other New South Wales coastal lagoons, exhibiting considerable spatial and temporal variation. A close similarity was observed in macroalgal community structure at sites affected by urban nutrient input, these being characterised by a high biomass often attributable to only one or two species. These nuisance macroalgae were mostly green algae, which were almost entirely absent from other sites. Biomass at sites affected by urban nutrient input was generally within the range documented for eutrophic estuaries elsewhere. Analysis of macroalgal community structure showed no evidence of large-scale changes macroalgal communities attributable to the effects of power station cooling water except within 500m of the outfall. At sites affected by a 1-2??C temperature increase, community structure and the magnitude of the biomass were similar to sites deemed as being relatively free of human impact. A reduction in species diversity occurred only within the immediate discharge zone, where water temperatures were approximately 6??C above ambient temperatures. Excessive growth of nuisance macroalgal species was not observed at any of the sites influenced by power station cooling water. There were no distinct patterns in seasonality of macroalgal growth in this study, though the greatest biomass appeared to occur in spring. The irregular temporal variation in macroalgal growth suggests that the most significant factors affecting growth occur on a time scale of weeks to months. It is therefore likely nutrient input to the nearshore  through surface runoff is an important influence on the distribution and abundance of macroalgae in Lake Macquarie. This emphasises the need to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus input from urban sources in Lake management.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eutrophication</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Lake Macquarie</field><field name="subject">Marine algae</field><field name="subject">Macroalgae</field><field name="subject">Lake Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No entry without strategy : an evaluation of UN transitional administration approaches to building the rule of law in disrupted states</field><field name="creator">Bull, Carolyn, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">As a mode of intervention in which the UN assumed direct authority over disrupted states, transitional administrations represent unique examples of ambitious state-building projects. This thesis investigates the apparent failure of transitional administrations to establish the rule of law in Cambodia, Kosovo and East Timor. It identifies nine explanatory factors which are tested against each case study. In addition, it seeks to enhance conceptual understandings of the UN???s state-building agenda and to add to empirical studies regarding attempts by external actors to establish the rule of law in disrupted states. Three findings emerge. First, in each case, UN transitional administrations failed in each of the following ways: to make the best use of their mandate; to establish effective state justice institutions; to build local commitment to the rule of law as a value system; to promote social relationships supportive of the rule of law; to ensure sufficient state capacity post-intervention; to maintain adequate levels of security; to address the existence of informal justice structures; to deal with the legacies of the past; and to ensure an adequate level of mission performance. Of these, establishing effective state justice institutions, building local commitment and addressing informal justice structures proved most crucial. Second, the state-based ???enforcement??? approach adopted by transitional administrations proved ineffective. Enacting laws and establishing coercive state structures such as judicial, police and prison services were critical to, but could not be equated with the rule of law. This approach did not account sufficiently for the importance of entrenched informal justice institutions, of the voluntary consent of local actors, or of appropriate institutional design choices. As a result, it did not offer real solutions to real problems faced by local actors. Finally, the UN failed to consider fully how to create an enabling ???space??? in which internal processes of change could occur, to engage appropriately with local actors, to overcome the tyrannies of truncated deployment, or to address these issues at the ???front-end??? of the mission. This ???entry without strategy??? approach to state-building seriously undermined the UN???s ability to establish the rule of law, as the self-declared touchstone of its state-building agenda.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United Nations : Transitional Authority in Cambodia</field><field name="subject">United Nations : Transitional Administration in East Timor</field><field name="subject">United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo</field><field name="subject">Nation-building</field><field name="subject">Rule of law</field><field name="subject">NATO</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance measurement of healthcare facility management: A way forward</field><field name="creator">Hamwi, Tayfe, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Facilities management is emerging rapidly as a distinct and critical field of study and professional practice for all sectors of the economy. In the past it has tended to be regarded as a service function and subsumed within other areas such as engineering, the built environment and business management. The health sector is an important part of the overall FM industry because it represents a driver of capital works that is both extensive and expensive. The health sector building requirements are growing, demand regular maintenance and upgrading, and are critical to core business.  An extensive literature review revealed that there has been minimal published research into the development and implementation of a central feature of effective FM, namely, performance management. Performance management provides the primary evaluation and planning tool for FM, in that it identifies the performance indicators that are meaningful to FM and core business, provides measures for those indicators and enables projective planning and benchmarking to be undertaken. This research study assesses the possibility of developing a comprehensive performance measurement system for FM in the healthcare sector. The research has two main aims: - To identify the knowledge gaps in current FM performance measurement systems in general, and for the healthcare sector in particular. - To investigate the possibility of benchmarking FM performance across the healthcare sector using a weighted assessment across all categories of performance. In order to meet the research purpose and data collection requirements from the relatively limited number of FM experts who specialise in the health sector, the research methodology employs a combination of a case study approach as an exploratory tool, and a phenomenological approach as the main qualitative design.  In achieving the aims and objectives, this research helps in improving FM practice in the healthcare sector through: - Providing facility managers with a comprehensive study which highlights the achievements and knowledge gaps in FM and its performance measurement - Providing top management with a study for the effectiveness of developing decision support strategy to make effective and efficient changes to their facility management practices - Facilitate the implementation of benchmarking techniques in the health sector, in order to improve the performance of the healthcare sector FM over time.  The study concludes that developing aggregate/collective KPIs for each performance measurement category of possible measure (social/quality, financial, environmental, functional, and technical) is feasible. However, before being able to develop and implement that approach an improvement to the current FM practices is required. The improvement can be achieved via either a voluntarily or compulsory commitment from top management towards FM in the organizations. This commitment should be implemented with an appropriate hierarchy from the bottom to the top. The key components include: establishing the contribution of FM to the success of the overall business in financial terms; setting agreed FM objectives; deriving meaningful general KPIs; defining the data required for each KPI; establishing the system for collecting, analyzing and interpreting the data; and conducting the benchmarking process for continual improvement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healthcare</field><field name="subject">Facility management</field><field name="subject">Key performance indicator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The collapse of dialogue:Intellectuals and politics in the Uruguayan crisis, 1960-1973</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Stephen William George, Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the context of the growing political instability and deepening economic crisis in Uruguay during the 1960s and early 1970s, the thesis examines two propositions. The first is that politically informed intellectuals, though disaffected or marginalised, will integrate themselves into the political mainstream if circumstances demand and a suitable vehicle allows them to participate usefully in the political process. The second is that, in the Uruguayan case, an expanded notion of dialogue is essential in analysing how this was accomplished, partly because the idea of dialogue was a necessary part of how they worked together and communicated with their public, and partly because dialogue was seen as a crucial element in reforming the nation and as the basis of the relationship between the political party that was to be the agent of such reform and its potential constituency. The thesis begins by examining how the so-called 1945 and 1960s generations overcame intergenerational squabbles and worked together, with the help of an expanding publishing industry, to create a public for their meditations on Uruguay's problems. Then, after briefly outlining the importance of dialogue to the essay as a genre and its role in developing national identity in Latin America, the study examines essays on the state of Uruguay by four major writers in the 1960s: Roberto Ares Pons, Alberto Methol Ferr??, Carlos Maggi and Washington Lockhart. The thesis then traces the intelligentsia's role in the several attempts to heal the rifts within the Uruguayan left and in the formation of the centre left coalition, the Frente Amplio, in 1971, to show how the notion of dialogue was incorporated into its structure, mode of operation and political program. The final section, a case study of Mario Benedetti's political activities and propagandist essays of 1971-1973, examines the contradictions of working as a committed intellectual when the very conditions necessary for intellectual life are breaking down. The thesis concludes that the resurrection of the nation as a site for dialogue with and among all members of society, a project in which the intelligentsia had enthusiastically participated, foundered because drastic political polarisation permitted only one militarist and monologic solution.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uruguay</field><field name="subject">intellectuals</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">1960-1973</field><field name="subject">Frente Amplio</field><field name="subject">Mario Benedetti</field><field name="subject">Carlos Maggi</field><field name="subject">Carlos Maggi</field><field name="subject">Albert Methol Ferre</field><field name="subject">Roberto Ares Pons</field><field name="subject">Washington Lockhart</field><field name="subject">publishing industry</field><field name="subject">Liber Seregni</field><field name="subject">essays</field><field name="subject">manifestos</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of chemical additives on the interfacial phenomena of high alumina refractories with al-alloys</field><field name="creator">Koshy, Pramod, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Understanding high temperature interfacial phenomena with Al-alloys is essential for improving corrosion performance of refractories in melting/holding furnaces. Both physical and chemical properties are known to influence wetting and corrosion behaviour. However, uncertainties exist regarding the influence of SiO2 in refractory compositions on interfacial reactions/mechanisms, particularly when present along with non-wetting chemical additives like BaSO4, CaF2 and AlF3.  An experimental study was conducted to clarify the interfacial phenomena of Al-alloy7075 with high-alumina refractories at extreme furnace temperatures of 1250??C and 815??C, using classical sessile drop approach and industrial cup tests respectively.  At 1250??C, Al-alloy reacted more intensely with SiO2 compared to Al2O3. The interfacial behaviour of SiO2-Al2O3 system with Al-alloy was strongly dependent on SiO2 percentage, such that when upto 25% silica was present, wetting was reduced due to the presence of both original and newly formed corundum. Formation of mullite and originally present silica, along with decreasing corundum contents increased wetting in systems where silica varied from 25-45wt% and more than 45wt% respectively. Moreover, the nature of silica did not influence wetting when present in concentrations less than 20wt%. Different additives produced varying interfacial reactions in the Al-alloy/high-alumina refractory system. AlF3 did not improve the wetting resistance, except when present in high concentrations (&gt;10wt%) in the refractory; this improvement attributed to corundum-rich matrix formation resulting from silica loss as gaseous fluorides. Low CaF2 amounts (&lt;3wt%) improved the wetting resistance due to corundum presence and anorthite formation in the refractory. As CaF2 content exceeded 5wt%, proportion of glassy phases increased, hence enhancing interfacial reactions. However unlike CaF2, low BaSO4 levels (&lt;5wt%) decreased the wetting resistance due to barium silicate formation, while high BaSO4 concentrations (&#8805;10wt%) increased the wetting  resistance due to celsian formation. Also, CaF2 dominated interfacial mechanisms when present along with BaSO4 in the refractory.  The effect of additives on modifying wetting resistance was found to strongly vary with SiO2 levels of the refractory. The study demonstrated that additive effect is also influenced by treatment temperatures such that generally higher additive amounts are required at lower temperatures for improving the wetting resistance of high-alumina refractories.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-wetting additives</field><field name="subject">Refractory</field><field name="subject">Aluminium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reconfigured frame: Various forms &amp; functions of the physical frame in contemporary art</field><field name="creator">Geraghty, Ian Craig, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a critical analysis and reconfiguration of the physical frame in contemporary art. Drawing on historical, theoretical and technical knowledge bases,  the thesis characterises the physical frame as the material manifestation of an act (or set of acts) of framing: a constructed ??surplus?? or necessary appendage created to mediate and protect an artwork, connecting it to physical and conceptual contexts in order to facilitate a better understanding of the framed work. The frame is thus depicted as ??work-sensitive??, being formed in response to, and as a direct result of, the work of art. This distinguishes the frame from notions of ??site?? and ??place??, which both connote pre- existing spaces. The physical frame, rather than describing the setting or site to which an artwork is added or contributes to, describes the material build-up which is added to the work.  The thesis documents and examines the various ways that contemporary artists employ physical frames to negotiate physical and conceptual space for artworks. This framing perspective is contrary to the prevalent mindset that contemporary artworks - having broken out beyond the picture frame into real space and time - are now frameless. As a result of this research, the physical frame is reconfigured as an open-ended cellular construct, offering up multiple narrative threads.  A distinction is made in the thesis between an ??immediate?? frame (a frame immediately attached to an artwork which the viewer stands on the ??outside?? of, such as a picture frame) and an ??extended?? frame (an immersive kind of frame experienced by the viewer from ??within?? the frame, as with a ??circumtextual?? frame). In addition to clarifying and developing upon existing framing terminology, this thesis presents a new taxonomic scale of frames in order to test the hypothesis that ??immediate?? frames can be discussed and categorised according to their level of involvement with their associated artworks. This framing model offers a new filter through which to approach the contemporary artwork, and provides a method, vocabulary and set of questions to dissect and articulate the presence and relevance of a detected frame.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Frame</field><field name="subject">Contemporary</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E-learning adoption in a campus university as a complex adaptive system: mapping lecturer strategies</field><field name="creator">Russell, Carol , Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The adoption of e-learning technologies in campus universities has not realised its potential for meeting the learning needs and expectations of 21st century students. By modelling university learning and teaching as a complex adaptive system, this thesis develops a new way of understanding and managing the adoption of new learning technologies in campus universities. The literature on learning and teaching in higher education indicates that lecturers??? ability to innovate in their teaching is constrained by tacit and discipline-specific educational knowledge. Introducing new methods and technologies into mainstream university teaching requires explicit review of educational knowledge, and requires support from departmental and institutional organizational systems. Research on organizational change in other contexts, such as manufacturing industry, has used complex adaptive systems modelling to understand the systemic interdependence of individual strategies, organizations and technologies. These models suggest that the integration of new e-learning technologies into mainstream campus university teaching will involve corresponding change processes. Part of this change requires the linking up of diverse disciplinary perspectives on learning and teaching. The thesis develops a conceptual framework for researching university learning and teaching as a complex adaptive system that includes learning technologies, people, and their organization within a university. Complex adaptive systems theory suggests that the capacity of a campus university to adapt to new e-learning technologies will be reflected in patterns in the strategies of those lecturers who are early adopters of those technologies. A context-specific study in the University of New South Wales used cognitive mapping to represent and analyse the strategies of a group of 19 early adopters of e-learning technology. These early adopters were participants in a cross-discipline Fellowship programme intended to develop their ability to act as change agents within the university. Analysis of the maps gathered before and after the Fellowship, triangulated with data on the Fellows??? participation in organizational change, leads to a new way of modelling how university learning and teaching systems, including their technologies, adapt within a complex and changing higher education context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive mapping</field><field name="subject">e-learning adoption</field><field name="subject">complex adaptive systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote synchronization method for the quasi-zenith satellite system</field><field name="creator">Tappero, Fabrizio, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a novel satellite timekeeping system which does not require on-board atomic clocks as used by existing navigation satellite systems such as GPS, GLONASS or the planned GALILEO system. This concept is di&#64256;erentiated by the employment of a synchronization framework combined with lightweight steerable on-board clocks which act as transponders re-broadcasting the precise time remotely provided by the time synchronization network located on the ground. This allows the system to operate optimally when satellites are in direct contact with the ground station, making it suitable for a system like the Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System, QZSS. Low satellite mass and low satellite manufacturing and launch cost are signi&#64257;cant advantages of this novel system. Two possible implementations of the time synchronization network for QZSS are presented. Additionally, the problem of satellite communication interruption is analyzed and a solution is presented. Finally a positioning and timing quality analysis, aimed to provide understanding of the actual timing quality requirements for QZSS, is presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">timekeeping</field><field name="subject">QZSS</field><field name="subject">GNSS</field><field name="subject">synchronization</field><field name="subject">satellite</field><field name="subject">clock</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the mechanisms responsible for perceptual learning in humans</field><field name="creator">Lavis, Yvonna Marie, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Discrimination between similar stimuli is enhanced more by intermixed pre-exposure than by blocked pre-exposure to those stimuli. The salience modulation account of this intermixed-blocked effect proposes that the unique elements of intermixed stimuli are more salient than those of blocked stimuli. The inhibition account proposes that inhibitory links between the unique elements of intermixed stimuli enhance discrimination. The current thesis evaluated the two accounts in their ability to explain this effect in humans. In Experiments 1 and 2, categorisation and same-different judgements were more accurate for intermixed than for blocked stimuli. This indicates that intermixed pre-exposure decreases generalisation and increases discriminability more than does blocked pre-exposure. In Experiments 3 ?? 5, same-different judgements were more accurate when at least one of the two stimuli was intermixed. This enhanced discrimination was not confined to two stimuli that had been directly intermixed. These results are better explained by salience modulation than by inhibition. Experiments 6 ?? 8 employed dot probe tasks, in which a grid stimulus was followed immediately by a probe. Neither intermixed nor blocked stimuli showed facilitated reaction times when the probe appeared in the location of the unique element. In Experiments 9 ?? 11 participants learned to categorise the intermixed unique elements more successfully than the blocked unique elements, but only when the unique elements were presented on a novel background during categorisation. Experiments 6 ?? 11 provide weak evidence that the intermixed unique elements are more salient than their blocked counterparts. In Experiment 12, participants were presented with the shape and location of a given unique element, and were required to select the correct colour. Performance was more accurate for intermixed than for blocked unique elements. In Experiment 13, participants learned to categorise intermixed, blocked and novel unique elements. Performance was better for intermixed than for blocked and novel unique elements, which did not differ. None of the proposed mechanisms for salience modulation anticipate these results. The intermixed-blocked effect in human perceptual learning is better explained by salience modulation than by inhibition. However, the salience modulation accounts that have been proposed received little support. An alternative account of salience modulation is considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discrimination learning</field><field name="subject">perceptual learning</field><field name="subject">salience</field><field name="subject">visual discrimination</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42882</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of migration on the people of Papua, Indonesia: A historical demographic analysis</field><field name="creator">Upton, Stuart Ingham, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since Papua became part of Indonesia in 1963, hundreds of thousands of people have migrated there from other parts of the nation. By 2000, over a third of the province??s residents were non-indigenous people, with the great majority of these immigrants living in the more developed urban areas along the coast. This mass movement has transformed the territory??s society, altering the social, cultural and economic position and opportunities of the indigenous inhabitants. This thesis uses statistical data from Indonesian government publications to describe the development of these changes to the province??s population from 1963 to the early part of the 21st century. While it is acknowledged that the military presence and actions in the territory have played a crucial role in creating distrust of the Indonesian government among the indigenous people, this material supports the thesis that the mass movement of people to the region has developed an identification among the indigenous peoples of the territory of being part of a single Papuan community, a Papuan nationalism. This migration has also limited the educational and employment opportunities of indigenous people, creating hostility towards the newcomers among indigenous people and resulting in an alienation from the Indonesian nation. It will be argued that the patterns of settlement, employment and perceptions of ethnic difference between indigenous and migrant groups reflect a form of internal colonialism that has resulted from this immigration. While independence is a popular aspiration among indigenous Papuans, an evaluation of the national political situation suggests that this event is unlikely in the foreseeable future. If Papuans are to be incorporated fully into the nation of Indonesia, an understanding of the impact of migration on the province??s people is vital. This material also suggests that while there have been negative consequences of the Indonesian rule of the territory, claims that the indigenous population has suffered from genocide perpetrated by Indonesian forces are not supported by the statistical data.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Papua</field><field name="subject">Demography</field><field name="subject">Indigenous people</field><field name="subject">Internal colonialism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of selective electrophoresis for proteins and peptides within proteomes</field><field name="creator">Ly, Linda, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Analysis of complex protein samples is demanding due to the wide dynamic range of expression levels and the limited detection range of technology. Proteomics relies heavily on the development of new fractionation strategies to help reduce complexity, and overcome the technological and biological challenges associated with proteome analysis. Here, the development of a prototype instrument named ??Microflow MF10?? was explored to enrich for particular classes of proteins.  The MF10 was found to have a number of advantages over commercially available fractionation systems. Due to the reduced separation electrode distance, fractionation was rapid, occuring within ~0.125 kVH over 2-6 fractions under native conditions but longer under denaturing conditions. As low as 2 ng peptide could be fractionated with recovery for downstream analysis achievable. The ability to alter protein charge by changing the pH (acidic (pI 3.6) to basic environments (pI 10.4)) allows selection of proteins based on charge/mobility, size, shape, buffer ionic strength, pH and field strength.  Proteins &lt;10 kDa are also not routinely analysed because current technology is unable to cater for this region of the proteome. Peptide enrichment using the MF10 was achieved using a 7-protein/peptide standard mix (1-25 kDa), to the 1-5 kDa fraction with simultaneous fractionation of the higher mass protein standards. Plasma was also used to enrich for the peptidome (&lt; 5 kDa) in the presence of the proteome. Enrichment of 73 proteins inclusive of 22 proteins in the 1-25 kDa fraction was achieved compared to a total equivalent of 42 proteins from unfractionated plasma.  Rare samples (&#8804; 106 cells) from stem cell populations or derived clinically are challenging due to the absolute limits in protein copy number and abundance. CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells and CD4+/CD8+ T-cells were used to develop fractionation methods and elucidate the cell differentiation process. MF10 fractionation and analysis by SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS revealed 24 differentially expressed proteins between the 3 cell populations, which may be involved in cell differentiation. To quantify these expression differences, iTRAQ with 2-D LC-MS/MS was applied.  This study has highlighted the challenges associated with samples of limited quantity. It has been successful in understanding the effects of various conditions on the electrophoretic mobility of proteins, which in proteomics, has remained largely unexplored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="subject">Electrophoresis</field><field name="subject">Fractionation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data reliability control in wireless sensor networks for data streaming applications</field><field name="creator">Le, Dinh Tuan, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes toward the design of a reliable and energy-efficient transport system for Wireless Sensor Networks. Wireless Sensor Networks have emerged as a vital new area in networking research. In many Wireless Sensor Network systems, a common task of sensor nodes is to sense the environment and send the sensed data to a sink node. Thus, the effectiveness of a Wireless Sensor Network depends on how reliably the sensor nodes can deliver their sensed data to the sink. However, the sensor nodes are susceptible to loss for various reasons when there are dynamics in wireless transmission medium, environmental interference, battery depletion, or accidentally damage, etc. Therefore, assuring reliable data delivery between the sensor nodes and the sink in Wireless Sensor Networks is a challenging task. The primary contributions of this thesis include four parts. First, we design, implement, and evaluate a cross-layer communication protocol for reliable data transfer for data streaming applications in Wireless Sensor Networks. We employ reliable algorithms in each layer of the communication stack. At the MAC layer, a CSMA MAC protocol with an explicit hop-by-hop Acknowledgment loss recovery is employed. To ensure the end-to-end reliability, the maximum number of retransmissions are estimated and used at each sensor node. At the transport layer, an end-to-end Negative Acknowledgment with an aggregated positive Acknowledgment mechanism is used. By inspecting the sequence numbers on the packets, the sink can detect which packets were lost. In addition, to increase the robustness of the system, a watchdog process is implemented at both base station and sensor nodes, which enable them to power cycle when an unexpected fault occurs. We present extensive evaluations, including theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments in the &#64257;eld based on Fleck-3 platform and the TinyOS operating system. The designed network system has been working in the &#64257;eld for over a year. The results show that our system is a promising solution to a sustainable irrigation system. Second, we present the design of a policy-based Sensor Reliability Management framework for Wireless Sensor Networks called SRM. SRM is based on hierarchical management architecture and on the policy-based network management paradigm. SRM allows the network administrators to interact with the Wireless Sensor Network via the management policies. SRM also provides a self-control capability to the network. This thesis restricts SRM to reliability management, but the same framework is also applicable for other management services by providing the management policies. Our experimental results show that SRM can offer sufficient reliability to the application users while reducing energy consumption by more than 50% compared to other approaches. Third, we propose an Energy-efficient and Reliable Transport Protocol called ERTP, which is designed for data streaming applications in Wireless Sensor Networks. ERTP is an adaptive transport protocol based on statistical reliability that ensures the number of data packets delivered to the sink exceeds the de&#64257;ned threshold while reducing the energy consumption. Using a statistical reliability metric when designing a reliable transport protocol guarantees the delivery of adequate information to the users,  and reduces energy consumption when compared to the absolute reliability. ERTP uses hop-by-hop Implicit Acknowledgment with a dynamically updated retransmission timeout for packet loss recovery. In multihop wireless networks, the transmitter can overhear a forwarding transmission and interpret it as an Implicit Acknowledgment. By combining the statistical reliability and the hop-by-hop Implicit Acknowledgment loss recovery, ERTP can offer sufficient reliability to the application users with minimal energy expense. Our extensive simulations and experimental evaluations show that ERTP can reduce energy consumption by more than 45% when compared to the state-of- the-art protocol. Consequently, sensor nodes are more energy-efficient and the lifespan of the unattended Wireless Sensor Network is increased. In Wireless Sensor Networks, sensor node failures can create network partitions or coverage loss which can not be solved by providing reliability at higher layers of the protocol stack. In the &#64257;nal part of this thesis, we investigate the problem of maintaining the network connectivity and coverage when the sensor nodes are failed. We consider a hybrid Wireless Sensor Network where a subset of the nodes has the ability to move at a high energy expense. When a node has low remaining energy (dying node) but it is a critical node which constitutes the network such as a cluster head, it will seek a replacement. If a redundant node is located in the transmission range of the dying node and can ful&#64257;ll the network connectivity and coverage requirement, it can be used for substitution. Otherwise, a protocol should be in place to relocate the redundant sensor node for replacement. We propose a distributed protocol for Mobile Sensor Relocation problem called Moser. Moser works in three phases. In the &#64257;rst phase, the dying node determines if network partition occurs, &#64257;nds an available mobile node, and asks for replacement by using &#64258;ooding algorithm. The dying node also decides the movement schedule of the available mobile node based on certain criteria. The second phase of the Moser protocol involves the actual movement of the mobile nodes to approach the location of the dying node. Finally, when the mobile node has reached the transmission of the dying node, it communicates to the dying nodes and moves to a desired location, where the network connectivity and coverage to the neighbors of the dying nodes are preserved.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transport protocol</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor network</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Network management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An enquiry into new methodologies for evaluating sustainable urban form</field><field name="creator">Osmond, Paul William Hughes, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a perceived gap in knowledge regarding the complex relationships between the physical form of the urban environment; its environmental performance as expressed through stocks and flows of materials and energy (urban metabolism); and its experienced physical and psychological qualities (urban ambience). The objective is to develop a practical methodological structure which, through investigating the relationships between these domains, may help inform the evaluation, design and development of more sustainable human settlements. One expression of this apparent knowledge gap is the ambiguity around the classification of urban form and identification of a suitable taxonomic framework to support analysis. Urban morphological research and practice is critically reviewed to derive a rigorous definition of the 'urban structural unit' (USU) to facilitate the subdivision and description of urban form across spatial scales. Application of this construct to a study site in Sydney, Australia provides the basis for subsequent exploration. Investigation of theoretical and applied perspectives on urban ecology, metabolism and design enables distillation of a utilitarian set of structural, functional and ambience properties of the USU. A variety of quantitative methods pertinent to evaluation of these properties is systematically examined to derive a streamlined analytical methodology, integrating hemispherical image analysis, space syntax, isovist and material accounting methods within the USU framework. The efficacy of this methodological 'toolkit' is tested in the final, empirical stage of the research, focussing mainly on the campus of the University of New South Wales. Determination of a range of material, microclimatic, ecosystemic, fractal, syntactic and isovist metrics provides a preliminary quantitative description of the campus USU in terms of its interrelated metabolic and ambience properties. This is further explained and interpreted through multivariate statistical analysis. The results suggest that the USU represents a robust framework for urban evaluation, and application of a relatively parsimonious suite of analytical methods enables a useful initial examination of the relations between significant aspects of urban form, metabolism and ambience. The outcomes of such an evaluation can directly inform built environment practice from a sustainability perspective, and also highlight areas for more detailed investigation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urban metabolism</field><field name="subject">Urban sustainability</field><field name="subject">Urban morphology</field><field name="subject">Urban ambience</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poverty, gender &amp; community development: The lived experiences of slum-dwelling women in Nairobi</field><field name="creator">Muli, Chrisanta Kanini, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores poverty and community development in the slums of Nairobi. It theorises on the nature of slum-dwelling women's lived experiences of poverty within a patriarchal society, and highlights not only their lack of financial capacity to address household needs, but also their lack of capabilities in terms of social and economic rights. The study provides identification and analysis of the significant role that slum-dwelling women play in community development initiatives. It proposes that these women??s individual and collective experiences of poverty, within Kenyan patriarchal society, are the fundamental motivation for them to engage in community development within their communities.  Critical concepts and theories driving the study are poverty, gender and community development, contextualised within the Kenyan state and society. A qualitative methodology was used, employing a participatory action research framework. A number of qualitative methods were applied: focus groups, semi-structured in-depth individual interviews, and documentary analysis. Women from three women??s groups based in Nairobi slums participated and were co-researchers. Guided by the ??voices?? of slum-dwelling women, this thesis changed its original orientation concerning the use of information technology to an exploration of slum-dwelling women??s lived experiences of poverty. It is argued that these experiences catapulted the women into ??home-grown?? community development initiatives. Their lack of 'access' to fundamental resources and services is attributed, in large part, to the neo-colonial and patriarchal nature of Kenyan society that has perpetuated and compounded gender biases and inequality. This study identifies a disconnection between formal definitions of poverty and any resulting ??imposed?? community development initiatives, and the women??s analyses of their own priorities and needs. The women??s multi-level and intersectorial understanding of poverty, and their ??home-grown?? community development initiatives offer a finely contextualised, responsive and capacity-building alternative approach to addressing the reality of their poverty. This thesis proposes that for slum-dwelling women in Nairobi to benefit from community development, such development must be based upon their contextualised, class- and gender-framed definitions of poverty. This can be understood as the next generation of community development that is neither imposed nor externally managed, but emerges from the people, in this case the women in the slums of Nairobi who are experiencing the poverty. This emerging community development is generated from and by the women??s analyses of the disconnection, corruption and failure of current development approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vestibular evoked potentials:  Properties and clinical applications of extraocular reflexes.</field><field name="creator">Rosengren, Sally Marie, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vestibular-dependent surface potentials can be recorded from over the scalp following stimulation with intense air- (AC) and bone-conducted (BC) sound.  However, sound-evoked responses may be confounded by parallel stimulation of the auditory system.  To demonstrate the pure vestibular origin of the cortical potentials, patients with severe to profound bilateral hearing loss were stimulated with AC and BC sound.  The responses had the same amplitude as those recorded in normal subjects, and were only present in patients with preserved vestibular function, confirming their vestibular origin. One negative surface potential, the N15, was largest when measured over the forehead, and detailed mapping of this potential localised it to the eyes.  This extraocular response had the same polarity on each side of the eye and was altered by changing gaze direction, suggesting an extraocular muscle origin (i.e. an ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential, or OVEMP).  Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) produces large eye movements with horizontal and torsional components directed away from the cathode.  A modified electrode montage was used to characterise the OVEMPs produced by GVS.  OVEMPs recorded from beneath the eyes had the appropriate polarity to produce the torsional eye movement and likely originated in the inferior oblique muscles.  Sound-evoked OVEMPs were investigated in patients with superior canal dehiscence (SCD), as they have vestibular hypersensitivity to sound.  The SCD patients had large sound-evoked OVEMPs with low threshold, similar to the VEMP.  OVEMP amplitude was much larger in the patients than controls and could be an additional diagnostic marker for this condition. Although SCD patients have large VEMPs and eye movements evoked by AC sound, little is known about other vestibular reflexes.  It was shown that patients also have large sound-evoked vestibulo-spinal reflexes, similar to those evoked by GVS.  However, despite these large reflexes, there was little consistent whole body sway.  Finally, a case is reported in which the combination of VEMP and OVEMP results indicated the location and nature of a central nervous system lesion.  The patient had delayed potentials when stimulated on the left side, indicating a demyelinating lesion in the root entry zone of the left vestibulocochlear nerve.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VEMP</field><field name="subject">vestibular</field><field name="subject">VOR</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41331</field></doc></add>
