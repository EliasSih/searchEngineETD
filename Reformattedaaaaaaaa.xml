Shows that IGF-1, IGF-2 and their binding proteins are present in fluid from a partial thickness cutaneous wound; that the binding proteins negatively modulate the activity of insulin-like growth factors in vitro, but that the IGFs do not necessarily show enhanced activity in vivo at the wound site if binding protein affinity is decreased.

(Paul Nigel)</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 217-244. Tachykinins are implicated in the mediation of airway inflammatory responses and may have roles in airway remodeling and healing. The actions of tachykinins are mediated by specific receptors, designated NK1, NK2 and NK3. Tachykinin degredation, an important mechanism for limiting the effects of these peptides, is principally mediated by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). This thesis investigates the role of tachykinins, in vivo, in an ovine model and in human airway epithelium. Results show that the nett effect of tachykinins in the airway will depend on the relative balance between the expression of receptors, tachykinins and NEP. Assessment of these molecules in the airway epithelium from subjects with normal lungs or chronic bronchitis showed that preprotachykinin-A gene expression was relatively higher in the disease group whereas NEP and NK1 receptor levels were unchanged. These studies provide new insights into the role of tachykinins in airways disease.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Tachykinins</field><field name="subject">Respiratory organs Diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phr464.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:22945261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resting forearm blood-tissue lactate and gas exchange kinetics during supine leg exercise</field><field name="creator">Catcheside, Peter.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 230-255.

The motor and sensory interactions between nutrients and proximal gut in humans are not well understood, despite the pivotal importance of these interactions on appetite, absorption and thus, nutrition. In part, this lack of knowledge results from technical difficulties in studying motor function in the human gut. In particular, the inability to continuously measure intraluminal flow with any degree of temporal resolution, has impeded progress in this field. The studies described in this thesis focus on nutrient-gut interactions, and also on the development of novel methodologies aimed at advancing the understanding and interpretation of the relationships between intraluminal pressures and flows.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system Motility</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09pha567.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:22945295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of food intake, body fat stores and energy balance in the marsupial Sminthopsis crassicaudata</field><field name="creator">Hope, Perdita Jane.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 363-421.

In addition, it was hoped to determine if a crude catechin extract from green tea could lower plasma cholesterol levels in the hypercholesterolaemic rabbit and ascertain if this effect was due to an increase in the LDL receptor.

An historical examination (collecting and analysing all relevant historical sources), shows that it is likely that H&#252;bbe was the actual draftsman, while a comparative legal analysis (contrasting Hamburg's land law at the beginning of the 19th century with the first bill of the Act) demonstrates that there is a strong similarity between Hamburg's land registration system and the original Torrens System; and, that the outstanding differences between the systems can be explained by the natural adaptation processes which are implied by the adoption of laws.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">H&#252;bbe, Ulrich</field><field name="subject">Torrens, Robert, Sir, 1814-1884</field><field name="subject">South Australia.

Both hepatocyte cultures and reticulocyte lysates were utilized as in vitro tools of investigation. The findings imply that the inhibition of protein synthesis by direct action of the toxin cannot be considered a primary cause of hepatocyte cell death over an acute time frame. Cytochrome P450-derived metabolites may play a crucial role in cytotoxicity, and the toxicity process does not appear to involve oxidative damage.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field

[37]-40) Drawing on qualitative data collected during semi-structured interviews with 36 profit centre managers in manufacturing firms in Victoria, Australia, this study seeks to explore the mechanisms used to manage multiple manufacturing performance dimensions arising from the pursuit of profit centre strategy.  Where measures capture potentially conflicting influences on the manufacturing cost function, strategy implementation is facilitated by loosening control reactions to cost variances and through explicit attempts to integrate multiple measures.  However, a joint emphasis on performance dimensions relating to manufacturing efficiency and customer responsiveness emerges as problematic.  In contrast, a joint emphasis on quality and efficiency is relatively easily managed.  It is suggested that in the context of responsiveness strategies, the difficulty of designing complete measures inhibits the relevance of performance measurement systems as a facilitator of strategy implementation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">ANU</field><field name="subject">Performance standards Measurement</field><field name="subject">Production management</field><field name="identifier">http://wff1.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/accwww/research/res_papers.html</field><field name="identifier">http://wff2.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/accwww/research/papers/0200%20ALillis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://www1.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/accwww/research/res_papers.html</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24092757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using diagnostic controls to maintain and direct the momentum of strategic change - a case study</field><field name="creator">Lawson, Benn.</field><field name="description">"December 2001" Includes bibliographical references : (p. 31-32) Simons (1990) notion of interactive controls has been used in the literature to examine the role of management control systems in facilitating strategic change.  The implications of strategic change for routine diagnostic feedback mechanisms have received less attention.  Drawing on interview and archival data from a single case study of an Australian pump manufacturer, we examine the way diagnostic controls are used in the immediate period following strategic change.  The changes in diagnostic controls are shown not only to align the organization in a self-regulating way to a new strategic direction, but also to promote learning, co-operation and culture change which are integral to, rather than an outcome of the strategic change process.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">ANU</field><field name="subject">Industrial management</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="identifier">http://wff2.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/accwww/research/papers/0201%20BLawson&amp;ALillis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24092801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Customer costing responsiveness - an analytical framework</field><field name="creator">Lillis, Anne M.</field><field name="description">"January 2002" Includes bibliographical references: (p. 31-34). The primary purpose of this study is to develop a framework for identifying the primary drivers of the costs of being customer responsive.  The authors' aim is to develop an understanding of the causal drivers of the costs of responsiveness as these costs are considered to be an important input to strategic and tactical decisions.  In developing this framework, the paper links the characteristics of responsive manufacturing from the operations management literature with the insights from studies in the accounting literature relating to the drivers of cost.  The paper attempts to model the cost impact when a firm responds to ad hoc demands involving the product customization, variation in product mix, or changes to delivery schedules.  The costs emerge as a function of the type of responsiveness and the resource capacity management strategy implemented by the firm.  The magnitude and dynamics of market demands and firm response, as well as the inherent flexibility of the firm's resources are seen as influencing the magnitude of the costs of responsiveness. disper</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">ANU</field><field name="subject">Customer services Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Customer services</field><field name="identifier">http://wff2.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/accwww/research/papers/0202%20ALillis&amp;MAAbernethy.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24092813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial analysts and intangible assets</field><field name="creator">Wyatt, Anne.</field><field name="description">"June 2002" Includes bibliographical references: (p. 30-35). The papers examines the association between the transparency of corporate financial reporting on intangible assets relative to a proxy for total intangible assets, and analyst incentives to follow firms and properties of analysts' earnings forecasts - controlling for endogeneity among these factors. More transparent financial reporting on intangible assets is measured by higher recognition of intangible assets on the balance sheet relative to a proxy variable for total (underlying) intangible assets, market value added which equals equity market value minus book value with intangible assets subtracted. The results suggest (1) a reputation for transparent financial reporting on intangible assets is associated with increased demand for analyst research and thus analyst following incentives; and (2) a reputation for less transparent reporting on intangible assets is associated with higher forecast dispersion and errors due to analysts' greater reliance on their own private information. The study extends research on determinants of analyst following, forecast dispersion and accuracy, and research on the impact of public disclosure on private information acquisition activity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">ANU</field><field name="subject">Finance Accounting</field><field name="subject">Intangible property Accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://wff2.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/accwww/research/papers/0204%20AWyatt&amp;JWong.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24092841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capitalising on the potential of cross-sectional field studies for theory refinement in management accounting</field><field name="creator">Lillis, Anne M.</field><field name="description">"January 2002" Includes bibliographical references: (p. 26-28).</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">ANU</field><field name="subject">Managerial accounting Case studies</field><field name="subject">Managerial accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://wff2.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/accwww/research/papers/0203%20ALillis&amp;JMundy.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24230877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">National review of nursing education : student expectations of nursing education</field><field name="creator">Saltmarsh, David L.

The process of calibrating a numerical model is examined in this thesis with an application to the flow of groundwater in the Willunga Basin in South Australia. The calibration process involves estimating unknown parameters of the numerical model so that the output obtained from the model is comparable with data that is observed in the field. Three methods for calibrating numerical models are discussed, these being the steepest descent method, the nonlinear least squares method, and a new method called the response function method.

Bibliography: p. 288-315. Describes a series of four experiments which were conducted to test the theory of psychopraxia. The thesis is an investigation of the theory from the perspective of paranormal phenomena only. It is argued that the theory of psychopraxia is important to the field of parapsychology because it offers (a) a philosophical critique on taken-for-granted assumptions about the nature of the paranormal, (b) relatively unambiguous terminology, and (c) a process-oriented approach to investigations of the paranormal by concentrating on conditions deemed necessary in bringing about paranormal effects. The thesis concludes that, in its current form, the psychopraxia model needs clarification of its most crucial concepts ("self", "pro-attitude" and "necessary conditions") before it can be regarded as a workable theory.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Parapsychology Investigation</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phs885.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24719664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fictocritical sentences</field><field name="creator">Robb, Simon.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references (leaves 166-168).

This thesis investigates key drivers of sponsorship renewal. The market orientation of sponsors, and their perception of their sponsored entity's (property's) market orientation, are analysed as antecedents of the trust invested by sponsors in the relationship, the level of commitment they exhibit and both the economic and non-economic satisfaction they derive from it. Sponsor economic and non-economic satisfaction and their commitment to the relationship are considered to be the ultimate drivers of the decision to renew. The argument is presented that sponsorship is a form of strategic or co-marketing alliance.

This study traces the development of Schumann's procedures by first analysing the songs of 1840 to see which repeated musical devices connected with texts. Once they have been identified, the application of these devices is then examined, retrospectively, in selected works for solo piano. Relying heavily on Schumann's diaries and letters, as well as a detailed analysis of selected works for voice and solo piano, this study shows the extra-musical meaning to be ultimately concerned with Schumann's wish to marry Clara Wieck and her father's unyeilding opposition to the idea.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Schumann, Robert, 1810-1856 Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm817.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24720679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images of the crucifixion in late antiquity : the testimony of engraved gems</field><field name="creator">Harley, Felicity.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 289-313.

This thesis examines the autobiographical texts of the Aboriginal women writers, Oodgeroo, Margaret Tusker and Monica Clare, in light of the 'community of commitment' which supported their publications. It considers how and why the Aboriginal women elicted outside support and how the ideology of the group informed the epistemology of the text.The role of collaborating white editors and professional editors are examined as crucial in influencing the style and content of the finished piece. The original manuscripts are compared against the published editions and the changes implemented by the editor are described. Following Frantz Fanon and Homi Bhaba, the adoption of the white ideological lattice by the Aboriginal author is characterised as the white mask of colonial mimicry. The outcomes of cross-cultural impersonation of the white editor are discussed, with the editorial collaboration viewed as the imposition of stereotyped representations of Aboriginality.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">QU:SSAH</field><field name="subject">Oodgeroo Noonuccal, 1920-1993.

This thesis presents the design, analysis and implementation aspects of a new Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control scheme. To overcome the shortfalls associated with existing TCP congestion control schemes, which are heuristic based, a novel self-tuning proportional and derivative control based TCP (ST-PD TCP) congestion control system is proposed, which approaches the congestion control problem from a control-theoretic perspective where the TCP congestion window is adjusted by a classic PD controller aiming to keep the buffer occupancy of the bottleneck node on the connection path at an ideal operating level. The control gains of the PD controller are tuned on-line by a fuzzy logic controller based on the perceived bandwidth-delay product of the TCP connection.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phx797.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24830566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrographic image analysis as a tool to quantify porosity and cement distribution</field><field name="creator">Nejedlik, John.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references (leaves 153-157).

Having identified these factors, I propose that a dual approach to the protection of indigenous peoples' traditional lands and their environment be adopted, whereby international laws that set out the rights of indigenous peoples and place duties on states in this regard, are reinforced and translated into practice through the self-regulation of the international oil industry through a voluntary code of conduct for oil companies seeking to operate on indigenous peoples' traditional lands."</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Land tenure Economic aspects Ecuador</field><field name="subject">Land tenure Economic aspects Nigeria</field><field name="subject">Land tenure Economic aspects Soviet Union</field><field name="subject">Oil industries Ecuador</field><field name="subject">Oil industries Nigeria</field><field name="subject">Oil industries Soviet Union</field><field name="subject">Oil and gas leases Ecuador</field><field name="subject">Oil and gas leases Nigeria</field><field name="subject">Oil and gas leases Soviet Union</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples Nigeria</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples Soviet Union</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phw346.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:24830581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The legislation of the late Republic : some neglected evidence in the historiography of the fall of the Roman Republic</field><field name="creator">D&#382;ino, Danijel.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 121-137.

An enzymatic assay was developed and optimised to detect and quantify mannose: the most efficient enzyme addition sequences were hexokinase with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucose isomerase and phosphomannose isomerase. An acid hydrolysis procedure to cleave mannose from mannoproteins was optimised: optimal conditions being in the presence of 1.5M sulphuric acid for 1.5 hours at 100C&#65058;.

In particular, it investigates the manner in which a distinct group of worker-level leaders and change agents affected the generation and implementation of change and helped to shape the change process in an organisation undergoing planned change. The data for the thesis were obtained from a three-year, longitudinal case-study of organisational change in a medium-sized automotive components manufacturer, Moving Metals Limited (MML).

Electronic publication: Full text available in PDF format; abstract in HTML format. Private practice as a career option for nurses has been slowly increasing since the 1980's. However, the reasons for this development have not been fully investigated so that it can be understood and placed within the changing contexts of health care and health services. The expansion and extension of nurses' roles is a contemporary topic in health care reform and therefore one that deserves investigation. The aims of this study were to develop a theory on private practice nursing and to describe the characteristics and work of the self-employed nurse in Australia.

The teaching of probability in schools provides a good opportunity for examining how a new topic is integrated into a school curriculum. Furthermore, because probabilistic thinking is quite different from the deterministic thinking traditionally found in mathematics classrooms, such an examination is particularly able to highlight significant forces operating within educational practice. After six chapters which describe relevant aspects of the philosophical, cultural, and intellectual environment within which probability has been taught, a 'Broad-Spectrum Ecological Model' is developed to examine the forces which operate on a school system.

This thesis validated the use of sheep as a suitable animal model to study endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and to evaluate factors that may play a role in the healing of nasal epithelium after surgery. Nasal packing was shown to cause a significant injury and should be used by ESS surgeons with caution. Full-thickness wounds should be avoided in the nose where possible as the re-ciliation was significantly reduced when compared to partial-thickness wounds. In addition the healing of the nose took significantly longer than previously thought and was incomplete 84 days after surgery. Scanning electron microscopy was shown to be an important outcome measure for the healing of the nasal mucosa after ESS and a new technique for measuring the re-ciliation was validated.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09MS/09mss534.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:25145577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clay movement in a saline-sodic soil toposequence</field><field name="creator">Nathan, Muhammad.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references (leaves 78-86) In the Herrmanns sub-catchment in the Mt.

The results confirm that SA commercial fishers do interact with seals and that interactins with Australian Sea Lions may be disproportionately more than with New Zealand Fur Seals. While some commercial fishers experience is similar to 2nd Century fishers and consider interference by seals to be major hindrance and suggest culling for management of seals, in general, SA commercial fishers are open to mitigation initiatives including gear modifications, to address seal interactions.

Applications with timing requirements, such as multimedia and live multi-user interaction, are becoming more prevalent in wide area networks. The desire to provide more predictable performance for such applications in packet switched wide area networks is evident in the channel management provided by Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks and in the extensions to the Internet protocols proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working groups on integrated and differentiated service. The ability to provide guarantees on the performance of traffic flows, such as packet delay and loss characteristics, relies on an accurate model of the traffic arrival and service at each node in the network. This thesis surveys the work in bounding packet delay based on various proposed queuing disciplines and proposes a method for more accurately defining the traffic arrival and worst case backlog experienced by packets.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09php825.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:25146189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of population lifetime data of South Australia 1841-1996</field><field name="creator">Leppard, P.

The average length of life from birth until death in a human population is a single statistic that is often used to characterise the prevailing health status of the population. It is one of many statistics calculated from an analysis that, for each age, combines the number of deaths with the size of the population in which these deaths occur. This analysis is generally known as life table analysis. Life tables have only occasionally been produced       specifically for South Australia, although the necessary data has been routinely collected since 1842. In this thesis, the mortality pattern of South Australia over the period of 150 years of European settlement is quantified by using life table analyses and estimates of average length of life.

Electronic publication: Fulltext available in PDF format; abstract in HTML format. The nursing practice of monitoring patients in the post-operative (PO) phase upon returning to the general ward setting has traditionally consisted of the systematic collection of vital signs and observation of other aspects of the patient's recovery. For the most part the primary focus of this monitoring has been the detection of post-operative complications. There is a need for more substantive evidence to support an appropriate frequency of post-operative observation. The aim of this research was to identify if the current practice of PO vital sign collection detects PO complications in the first 24 hours after the patient has returned to the general ward setting. Due to the complex world in which nurses practice the research was undertaken using a combination of methods within a triangulated approach to collect data.

Several researchers have indicated that the emphasis placed by young people on body shape and appearance has been greatly shaped by the media. The aim of this research was to investigate this notion specifically with regard to televised media. It was hypothesised that there would be a relationship between media images, eating attitudes        and dietary behaviours, particularly for teenagers with body-image self-schemas who were conscious of their appearance. Nine hundred and sixty five senior secondary school students, from 33 country and metropolitan, state and independent, co-educational and single-sex South Australian high schools were surveyed.

This thesis presents several observational studies based on radio variability and interstellar scintillation of extragalactic flat-spectrum radio sources. Such sources are commonly called blazars, a term used to describe the phenomenon observed when the jet of a radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) is directed towards the observer. These  sources provide unique laboratories for studying the physics of relativistic jets. Observations of selected samples of blazars, made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Australia Telescope Long Baseline Array are presented here.

Explores from a feminist standpoint the gendered nature of discourse in contemporary Western architecture from an Australian perspective. The starting point for the thesis was an examination of Australian architectual discourse in search of some explanation for the continuing low numbers of women practitioners in Australia. Hypothesizes that contemporary Western architecture is imbued with a pervasive and dominant masculinity and that this is deeply imbedded in its discursive constructions: the body housed by architecture is assume to be male, the mind which produces architecture is assumed to be masculine. Given the cultural location of Australian architecture as a marginal participant in the wider arena of contemporary Western / international discourses, focuses on writing about two iconic figues in Western architecture; Le Corbusier, of international reknown; and, Glenn Murcutt, of predominantly local significance.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Le Corbusier, 1887-1965 Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Murcutt, Glenn, 1936- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Architecture and women</field><field name="subject">Feminism and architecture</field><field name="subject">Architecture and society Australia History</field><field name="subject">Women architects Australia History</field><field name="subject">Architecture Australia 20th century</field><field name="subject">Feminist theory</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phw5834.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:25314335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interference of intensity noise in a multimode Nd:YAG laser</field><field name="creator">Hill, Timothy J.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references (leaves 151-163).

This study investigates the osteometry and variation of the human spine. 348 human skeletons dating from 28,000 B.C. to the mid-20th century A.D. from 24 sites mainly in Switzerland and Southern Germany, and without macroscopic pathology, were measured with a caliper. The samples showed a microevolutionary increase in most of the spinal variables. As both mean values and standard deviations increased, this higher intra-group variability could be explained to be a result of relaxed natural selection. Various environmental or genetic factors could explain the short-term alteration of the spinal osteometry. The relative smaller size and decrease with age of the bony outline of the neural pathways in males could explain their high vulnerability to modern lower back pathologies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Spine Measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phr933.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:25314904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving from meat vegetarianism, beliefs and information sources</field><field name="creator">Lea, Emma J.</field><field name="description">Title from screen page; viewed 15 Dec 2003.

The performance bottlenecks of the basic refinement checking algorithms are identified and addressed with the introduction of a number of novel techniques and algorithms.

This model is based on the standard geometric Brownian motion (or Black-Scholes) model of a price process. However, the drift and volatility parameters are permitted to vary between a finite number of possible values at known times according to the state of a hidden Markov chain. This type of model has been found to replicate the Black-Scholes implied volatility smiles observed in the market and produce option prices which are closer to market values than those obtained from the traditional Black-Scholes formula.

This thesis seeks to demonstrate that the elucidation of these alternatives and their shared opposition to modernity are key themes in Strauss's &#339;uvre, particularly in his critical study of Niccol&#242; Machiavelli's teaching. Strauss maintains that the "crisis of our time" is the apogee of a modernity that has its point of origin in Machiavelli's rejection of biblical and classical morality as a guide to the efficacy of political virtue.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phs7137.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:25699648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lei e' servito?

Bibliography: leaves 153-176. Mucopolysaccharideosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA, Sanfilippo A syndrome) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, with a prevalence in Australia of 1 in 114,000. MPS IIIA is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme sulphamidase which is needed together with other exohydrolases and a N-acetyltransferase to break down the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate to sulphate and monosaccharides. Patients are characterised by severe central nervous systems degeneration together with mild somatic involvement; this disproportionate correlation is unique amongst the mucopolysaccharidoses. Features include severe behavioural disturbances, such as hyperactivity and aggressiveness, coarse hair and mild hepatosplenomegaly. Death is usually in the mid- to late-teenage years. Enzyme replacement therapy by intravenous administration of recombinant human NS (rhNS) has been proposed as a potential therapy for MPS IIIA. This thesis suggests that rhNS, entering the brain in the first few weeks of life, is able to retard the behaviour and learning difficulties in MPS IIIA mice.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Mucopolysaccharidosis Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Lysosomal storage diseases</field><field name="subject">Mice as laboratory animals</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phg5595.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:25699760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytic modelling of agent-based network routing algorithms</field><field name="creator">Costa, Andre.</field><field name="description">"November 4, 2002."

While studies have suggested that gastrointestinal pathogenicity associated with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and chemotherapy induced mucositis can be improved by the use of probiotics, the mechanisms of probiotic protection are not clearly understood. Such knowledge is necessary to achieve maximum benefit from such forms of treatment. This thesis describes investigations undertaken, initially to establish a non-invasive measure of intestinal barrier function, and then to examine the protective effects of different yoghurts on conditions which cause loss of barrier function: chemotherapy induced mucositis, inflammatory bowel disease and athletes in training. It was found that the function of the small intestine can be compromised under stress and that probiotics may improve compromised intestines through enhancing recovery of the intestinal mucosa and the barrier function.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm2162.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:25699764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origin of the geological structures, diapirs, grabens, and barite veins in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Mendis, Premalal J.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves [156-167] Map 1.

The purpose of this research is to determine these charge groups in order that they can be compared to the charge groups predicted by twisted K-theory for D-branes in a group manifold, thus providing a future important check to the theorem that D-brane charges are determined by twisted K-theory, one of the most important recent ideas in string theory.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">String models</field><field name="subject">D-branes</field><field name="subject">K-theory</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phd2727.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:25699780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diabetic retinopathy in the Katherine region of the Northern Territory</field><field name="creator">Jaross, Nandor.</field><field name="description">"January 2003."

Bibliography: leaves 285-308. This thesis critically examines the processes involved in the construction of the linguistic historical record for the north-west region of South Australia. Focussing on the work of Norman B. Tindale, the thesis looks at the construction of Tindale's Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Antikirinya representations. It argues that Tindale effectively reduced a diversity of indigenous practices to ordered categories more reflective of Western and colonial concepts than indigenous views. Tindale did not consider linguistic criteria in depth, had few informants, worked within arbitary tribal boundaries, was biased towards the category 'Pitjantjatjara' and was informed by notions of racial/linguistic purity. These factors which shaped the linguistic record must be taken into account when interpreting records for use as historical and native Title evidence.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">AIAS</field><field name="subject">Tindale, Norman B.

Bibliography: leaves 242-266. This thesis examines the effects on vegetation at selected sites in northern South Australia of excluding various herbivores over a four and a half year period and of two intense but controlled grazing pulses over a six month period followed by an 18 month recovery period in a dune-swale land system. These changes are compared with changes recorded over an 11-year period at the Olympic Dam mine site. It found that short-term changes in vegetation revealed by ordination of periodical cover, density and species richness, are attributable to the periodicity of rainfall and that, under present grazing regimes, rainfall effects override grazing effects. Differences between the effects of sheep and cattle hoof damage are worthy of further investigation, as is the impact of kangaroo grazing. These two factors may have important implications for the management of Australian rangelands.

Tibet maintained its own currency, government, armed forces and way of life until 1959. The thesis also examines the cultural shifts in the political, social and military spheres in these countries. It assumes that the general world trend in political life has been towards increasingly intolerant and extreme politics.

It explores the possibility that bone resorption that is not balanced by bone formation is caused by an abnormal expression of factors that regulate osteoclast formation and activity in the tissue adjacent to the site of pathological bone loss, and seeks to identify these factors in human tissues in situ. It also seeks to elucidate a possible mechanism by which osteolytic mediators induce bone osteolysis in several bone pathologies associated with bone loss. The study shows that the same mechanisms of osteolysis apply to several diseases in humans and suggests that simliar approaches could be used to inhibit osteolysis in localised bone loss.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc9516.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26044273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A lentiviral gene transfer vector for the treatment of cystic fibrosis airway disease</field><field name="creator">Limberis, Maria.</field><field name="description">"16th September 2002."

Analysis of the expression of Drosophilia cyclin EII through development show that it was present during larval development and oogenesis, implying a role for DmcycEII outside of early embyogenesis. Ectopic expression analyses using full-length DmcycE proteins as well as N- and C-terminal deletions of DmcycEI, revealed that DmcycEII and N-terminal deletions were able to drive all G1 cells within the morphogenetic furrow of the eye imaginal disc into S phase, while a C-terminal deletion of DmcycEI could not. These results show the DmcycEII is more potent than DmcycEI in driving cells into S phase and that the N-terminal region of DmcycEI contains a negative regulatory domean., suggesting that an inhibitor is present in the posterior morphogenetic furrow that binds to DmcycEI N-terminus and inhibits DmcycEI function. To identify the DmcycEI specific inhibitor, genetic interaction and yeast-2 hybrid screens were undertaken, and an enhancer CG7394, encoding a MAGUK homologue was identified for further study.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Cyclin-dependent kinases</field><field name="subject">Drosophila Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc8837.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26218210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A molecular phylogenetic study of the Eugongylus group of skinks</field><field name="creator">Smith, Sarah A.

Summary: This research proposes a new site analysis methodology in the form of an integrated framework. The framework separates the site analysis process into different models, incorporates each model, and considers the interaction between them. The most important models are the environmental models (climate, geology, hydrology, topography, and vegetation models), social-cultural models, economic models, and infrastructure models. Each model also contains several important factors.The study identifies and organizes environmental factors within the framework that influence site analysis and design. Based on the applicability of feng shui principles and their interpretations into measurable factors, this research compares and incorporates feng shui and contemporary environmental design theories, and summarizes essential environmental factors. The emphasis on environmental factors from these models may lead to a better understanding of the relationships between humankind and the natural environment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">NTSM</field><field name="subject">Feng shui</field><field name="subject">Architecture Environmental aspects Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-10172003-101905</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26266404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of velvet tobacco mottle virus RNA replication by enzyme-template complexes in extracts from infected leaves</field><field name="creator">Rohozinski, J.

This thesis is concerned with the process of change and adaptation in four Australian manufacturing companies in the period 1989 to 1996. The thesis seeks to explain the reaction of these companies to the pressures for change, and particularly for the adoption of 'best practice' management prescriptions in the organization of work and human resource management. The operating hypothesis adopted is that the pattern of changes undertaken by manufacturing organizations are shaped by a variety of factors both external to and within the company, but that management beliefs and orientations are a key element in understanding the pace and extent of change. The research is pursued through detailed case studies designed to explore at length pressures for change and continuity in corporate decision-making.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Organizational change Australia</field><field name="subject">Organizational change Australia Management</field><field name="subject">Manufactures Management</field><field name="subject">Production management</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm15188.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hannah Arendt and her Augustinian inheritance : love, temporality, and judgement</field><field name="creator">White, Christopher H.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 276-298.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Arendt, Hannah Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Augustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo Influence</field><field name="subject">Love Religious aspects Christianity</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phw583.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitation and fertile islands : linking canopy effects with plant interactions</field><field name="creator">Hastwell, Graeme, 1952-</field><field name="description">Bibliography: p. 228-249. This thesis investigates whether trees generate heterogenity in resources and plant community composition and seeks to identify some of the canopy processes that may be responsible. The association between woody perennial plants and heterogeneity in soil resources and plant communities in an arid chenopod shrubland was studied. The results confirm that tree canopies are an important source of heterogeneity in both physical resources and plant community composition. Their effects on neighbouring plants increase with canopy size, while the generation of heterogeneity in soil resources appears to depend both on size and time.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phh3588.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical analysis of Tec Kinase regulatory regions : implications for the control of Kinase activity</field><field name="creator">Pursglove, Sharon Elizabeth.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 139-165.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Protein-tyrosine kinase</field><field name="subject">Cell metabolism Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09php9863.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and forest degradation : a case study in two villages in East Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Mujiyani.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 259-271. This study examines the impact of forest degradation on the social structure of a community, especially on gender roles. The study was conducted in 1996-1997 in Sempur and Timbenuh, two dusun in East Lombok, where the forest is their main source of livelihood. Both dusun experienced rapid social change caused by competition for access to forest resources, government monoculture policy (cinnamon) and the declaration of the forest as a protected area. As forest resources became less available, men in Sempur were forced to migrate to look for work or walk long distances and women tended to replace men's roles. Sempur is compared to Timbenuh where people had easier access to forest resources.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm9537.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primacy of ideology? : the confiscation and exchange of "degenerate art" in the Third Reich</field><field name="creator">Khut, Chiew-Lee, 1971-</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 156-167. The aim of this thesis is to show how in practice the National Socialists sacrificed ideological considerations to the material advantages that could be gained from the sale of "degenerate art". In practice the term "degenerate" was extended beyond modern art to include French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, specifically because they were highly saleable. This is evinced by the sales of "degenerate art" which were conducted by the Reichministerium f&#252;r Volkskl&#228;rung und Propaganda (RMVP). The record of the sales compiled by the propaganda ministry in the summer of 1941, provide conclusive evidence that the Reich government compromised its ideological position for financial gain. The sale of "degenerate art" conducted by order of the Reich at the Galerie Fischer auction in Lucerne in 1939, provides further evidence that the practice of confiscation was economically driven.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">National socialism and art</field><field name="subject">Art and state Germany History 20th century</field><field name="subject">Nazis Germany Art collections</field><field name="subject">Germany Cultural policy History 20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ARM/09armk45.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modelling and analysis of command and control decision processes using extended time petri nets</field><field name="creator">Bowden, Fred D.

Releases of classical biological control agents targeting weeds often fail to establish in the field. This thesis tested the importance of climate matching, predation, release technique, laboratory adaptation and inbreeding using two model systems; the bitou tip moth Comostolopsis germana, for the control of the weed Chrysanthemoides monilifera; and the plume moth Wheeleria spilodactylus for the control of horehound Marrubium vulgare. The hypothesis tested was that the moths failed to establish because they were poorly adapted to South Australia's Mediterranean climate. The bitou tip moth failed to establish primarily due to ant predation, but was also found to be poorly adapted to host plants suffering from moisture stress. A collection of imported French moths reared in the laboratory since 1992 were found to be suffering from inbreeding depression. Both Spanish and French moths imported in 1996 and 1997 performed well in the field, in contrast to predictions on climate matching on the basis of temperature and rainfall.&#240;  -`</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc5973.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stocking limits for South Australian pastoral leases : historical background and relationship with modern ecological and management theory</field><field name="creator">Tynan, R.

A thesis which aims to clarify the role of the basal ganglia in higher mental processes by investigating the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit, the lateral orbital frontal circuit and the anterior cingulate circuit and other language related circuitry. Twenty five right-handed people with verified lesions of this circuitry were tested for attention, perfomance of complex motor programs, executive functions, memory and language skills and compared to a control group. It was found that mental processing associated with the basal cortical circuitry was orchestration of subprocesses (at the cortical level) and their integration (at the subcortical level) to enable their fluid and effective synchronization for the person to complete more complex tasks.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc75235.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#273;) in obesity</field><field name="creator">Morris, Alison, 1974-</field><field name="description">Errata pasted onto front end-paper.

These peptides have moderate biological activity, including antibacterial and anticancer actions, as well as the capacity to inhibit the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Many potent broad-spectrum antibiotics have been isolated from Australian amphibians, and are believed to act by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane by forming transmembrane 'barrel-stave' type ion channels, lipid-incorporating toroidal pores or by assembling as a 'carpet' over the mebrane surface. The structures of several antibacterial peptides were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics calculations.

It aims, second, to contribute to feminist understanding of financial decision-making within households by focussing on those decisions that lead to the accumulation of debt within the domestic sphere.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Women Legal status, laws, etc. South Australia</field><field name="subject">Women South Australia Economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Women South Australia Social conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phh293.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of vitamin A and iron on anaemia and cognitive functioning of anaemic school children in Tanzania</field><field name="creator">Mwanri, Lillian.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 148-163.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Iron deficiency anemia in children Tanzania</field><field name="subject">Iron deficiency anemia in children Diet therapy</field><field name="subject">Anemia Tanzania Nutritional aspects</field><field name="subject">Vitamin A Therapeutic use Tanzania</field><field name="subject">Iron Therapeutic use Tanzania</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm994.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Myocardial metabolic and haemodynamic effects of perhexiline in in vivo and in vitro models</field><field name="creator">Unger, Steven Anthony.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 261-295. Perhexiline is an effective anti-anginal agent without clinically significant haemodynamic effects, which is postulated to have a primary 'metabolic' mechanism of action. Recent in vitro work in isolated cardiac mitochondria suggested that inhibition of the key enzyme in the regulation of fatty acid catabolism, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1), may play a key role in the action of perhexiline. The experiments described in this thesis are primarily aimed at investigating the postulated metabolic effects of perhexiline in the heart, and correlating these to changes in haemodynamics. Secondary aims are the assessment of the time-dependence of such changes, and the investigation of haemodynamic changes induced by parenteral perhexiline in a conscious animal model.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phu57.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic reviews of nursing research : development of a conceptual framework</field><field name="creator">Evans, David, 1955-</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 352-380. Systematic reviews of research have up to now excluded much of the research of nurses.  This study aimed to develop a process to systematically collect, appraise, summarise and synthesize the findings of a range of different types of research. A conceptual model was developed that addressed effectiveness, appropriateness and feasibility. Two systematic reviews, on the use of music in hospitals and the use of physical restraint, were conducted to evaluate the expanded review methods. They demonstrated that the proposed expanded review process was able to rigorously collect and summarise a range of different types of research. The conceptual framework also enabled each of the studies to be located logically and coherently during the sybthesis of data.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phe919.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combination anti-cytokine immunotherapy in an ovine model of gram-negative septic shock</field><field name="creator">Peake, Sandra Lois.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 288-336.

Examines sugar foraging in the field by adult female parasitoid wasp, Cotesia rubecula (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), to determine its effect on fecundity and lifespan.  In the field, the area in which wasps search for sugar is likely to depend on the degree of association of hosts with nectar or honeydew, supporting the hypothesis that sugar encounters in the field happen opportunistically during host foraging activities. The survival gained by sugar feeding my often be severely limited by quality and quantity of sugary food and extrinsic mortality factors such as adverse weather conditions and predation, so the need for food must be studied in relation to a species' adaptation to its environment. Concentrations of sugar sources may distract wasps from host-foraging when the density of hosts is low. This has implications for flower propagation in agro-ecosystems with a view to supporting natural enemies of insect pests.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Cotesia rubecula Food</field><field name="subject">Cotesia rubecula Physiology</field><field name="subject">Energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">Insect-plant relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phs5715.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A technique for examining longitudinal and cross sections of teased nerve fibres and its application to human and experimental neuropathy</field><field name="creator">Cai, Zhao.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references (leaves 194-225) A new method is described that enables longitudinal and cross sections of an individual nerve fibre to be cut at multiple specified sites along the fibre by use of an unique marker system.

Bibliography: p. 133-149. The RhoGEF activity of PBL is shown to be acting predominantly by the activation of Rho1 and downstream signaling pathways required for contractile ring function during cytokinesis. Genetic evidence suggests this could be through the activation of Diaphanous (an FH protein) to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, as well as through the activation of Rho-kinase which results in the phosphorylation, and activation of myosin. Highlights a possible role for PBL during contractile ring function  at a later stage that previously thought. Genetic interaction screens were employed to identify regulators of PBL activity during cytokinesis. CDK1 was identified genetically as a candidate for regulating PFB activity, but functional studies in vivo showed that this regulation was not by direct phophorylation of the PBK consensus CDK1 suites tested. Further screening has identified other possible components pf PBL signaling pathways, but a role during cytokinesis for these interactors remains to be confirmed. The eye phenotypes described provide ideal systems for the identification of components of PBL signaling pathways in Drosophila. The high level of conservation in the mechanism of cytokinesis from yeast to mammals would also suggest that the identified interactors would most likely represent components of cytokinesis pathways in all eukaryotes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Drosophila Genetics</field><field name="subject">Cytokinesis Genetic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09pho415.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and modelling studies of ignition and explosion in combustible atmospheres induced by heated particles</field><field name="creator">Stamatov, Venelin Alexandrov.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phs783.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biotic-abiotic transformations of chromium in long-term tannery waste contaminated soils : implications to remediation</field><field name="creator">Kamaludeen, Sara Parwin Banu.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 166-180.

This thesis examines whether economic rationalist policies, as implemented by Labor governments in Australia in the 1983-1996 period, are the key to achieving national competitive advantage, restructuring and employment growth. It is argued that, whilst the policies made some progress in this regard, more could have been achieved through the use of strategic industry policies. It is argued that the key weakness of the rationalist policies of the period is that of an uncritical faith in market forces to produce economic prosperity. Markets fail to produce competence in a range of crucial activities such as research and development, technology diffusion, work organisation, management, education and training, finance and export marketing. This thesis argues that strategic industry policies can foster national excellence in such capabilities, and so bring improvements in national competitive advantage, restructuring and employment growth, beyond that achievable by markets alone.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ARM/09armr817.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the gastrointestinal control of appetite and food intake</field><field name="creator">Vozzo, Rosalie.</field><field name="description">"June 2002" Bibliography: leaves 210-241.

The thesis investigates some common dietary approaches to reducing weight, the effect of fructose rather than glucose in the diet of non-insulin dependent diabetics, and the role of nitrous oxide as an appetite regulator. The studies reported provide new information on the regulation of appetite food intake by gastrointesinal mechanisms in healthy and type 2 diabetic humans.

These compounds, unlike 22:6n-3, were poor stimulators of the human neutrophil respiratory burst, an additional advantage in their use as ant-inflammatory agents.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc8379.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the role of soil micro-organisms in phosphorus mobilisation : a report submitted to fulfil the requrements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="creator">Coyle, Kieran.</field><field name="description">"September 2001" Includes bibliographical references (leaves 206-230)</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Soil microbiology</field><field name="subject">Soil ecology</field><field name="subject">Soils and nutrition</field><field name="subject">Soils Phosphorus content</field><field name="subject">Plant-soil relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc8814.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initial literacy in Papua New Guinea-indigenous languages, Tok Pisin or English?</field><field name="creator">Rumere, Deborah Anne.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 145-159.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Literacy programs Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Native language and education Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ED.M/09ed.mr936.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mammalian mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone system, new GrpE-like members and novel organellar substrates</field><field name="creator">Naylor, Dean Jason.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 104-136.

This thesis explores the application of numerical and statistical techniques for estimation of structure from motion in the uncalibrated case. It presents and compares a variety of methods for estimating the coefficients of the differential epipolar equation. The goal of this process is to derive a tractable total least squares estimator of structure from motion robust to the presence of inaccuracies in the data. Methods are also presented for rectifying optical flow to a particular motion estimate, eliminating outliers from the data, and calculating the relative motion of a camera over an image sequence.

Electronic publication; Full text available in PDF format; abstract in HTML format. Describes a series of four experiments which were conducted to test the theory of psychopraxia. The thesis is an investigation of the theory from the perspective of paranormal phenomena only. It is argued that the theory of psychopraxia is important to the field of parapsychology because it offers (a) a philosophical critique on taken-for-granted assumptions about the nature of the paranormal, (b) relatively unambiguous terminology, and (c) a process-oriented approach to investigations of the paranormal by concentrating on conditions deemed necessary in bringing about paranormal effects. The thesis concludes that, in its current form, the psychopraxia model needs clarification of its most crucial concepts ("self", "pro-attitude" and "necessary conditions") before it can be regarded as a workable theory.

However, a consistent but insignificant peak, which was not evident in control group responses, was noted in levels of nonsomatic depression, anxiety and stress in the early postpartum months.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phh811.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical application of sequence stratigraphy and risk analysis for stratigraphic trap exploration</field><field name="creator">Nakanishi, Takeshi.</field><field name="description">"September 2002" Includes bibliographical references (leaves 200-209) Outlines an evaluation procedure for stratigraphic trap exploration by employing sequence stratigraphy, 3D seismic data visualisation and quantitative risk analysis with case studies in an actual exploration basin.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Petroleum Australia Spectra</field><field name="subject">Seismology Australia</field><field name="subject">Oil fields Australia</field><field name="subject">Gas fields Australia</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic</field><field name="subject">Cooper Basin (Qld. and S.

Previously, many methods have been developed to predict the settlement of shallow foundations, however methods that have the required degree of accuracy and consistency have not yet been developed. In this research artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used in an attempt to obtain more accurate settlement prediction.

The average length of life from birth until death in a human population is a single statistic that is often used to characterise the prevailing health status of the population. It is one of many statistics calculated from an analysis that, for each age, combines the number of deaths with the size of the population in which these deaths occur. This analysis is generally known as life table analysis. Life tables have only occasionally been produced       specifically for South Australia, although the necessary data has been routinely collected since 1842. In this thesis, the mortality pattern of South Australia over the period of 150 years of European settlement is quantified by using life table analyses and estimates of average length of life.

Electronic publication: Full text available in PDF format; abstract in HTML format. Applications with timing requirements, such as multimedia and live multi-user interaction, are becoming more prevalent in wide area networks. The desire to provide more predictable performance for such applications in packet switched wide area networks is evident in the channel management provided by Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks and in the extensions to the Internet protocols proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working groups on integrated and differentiated service. The ability to provide guarantees on the performance of traffic flows, such as packet delay and loss characteristics, relies on an accurate model of the traffic arrival and service at each node in the network. This thesis surveys the work in bounding packet delay based on various proposed queuing disciplines and proposes a method for more accurately defining the traffic arrival and worst case backlog experienced by packets.

The aims of this thesis are the taxonomic description of new species, examination of the stygobiont amphipod fauna of Australia, the review of phylogenetic relationships among the Australian Crangonyctoidea, and generation of a key to all Australian freshwater amphipod species. A significant contribution has been made to knowledge of the freshwater amphipoda of Australia. Nine new genera are established and forty three new species described within the Crangonyctoidea and Melitidae. Previously, eighteen genera and forty species of those families had been described. Many of the new taxa are stygobionts and understanding of the diversity and abundance of these amphipods has contributed significantly to arguments in favour of groundwater conservation. Nevertheless, while the number of described species has more than doubled, it is clear many taxa among collections are unresolved.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phb7983.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disconcerting ecologies : representations of non-indigenous belonging in contemporary Australian literature and cultural discourse</field><field name="creator">Potter, Emily Claire.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references (leaves 313-325) Specific concern is the poetic, as well as literal, significance given to the environment, and in particular to land, as a measure of belonging in Australia.

Q fever, caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetti, is the most important and costly zoonotic infection in Australia. It manifests in both acute and chronic forms, with the majority of acute Q fever patients making a complete recovery. The strain of C. burnetti has not been found to play a role in the development of chronic Q fever, and it remains unclear why a minority of individuals manifest chronic forms of Q fever, while others make a complete recovery. This study attempts to elucidate possible immunogenetic markers that may contribute to an individual's risk of developing chronic Q fever, as well as attempting to gain a better understanding of the pathophysiological roles that certain variants of immune response genes may play in chronic Q fever. It is shown that the development of chronic Q fever conditions following an acute attack of Q fever have a genetic component, affecting those genes involved in the immune response. The immunogenetic predisposition to chronic Q fever is explored, and reveals important new associations that may help to increase the understanding of these chronic conditions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phh4739.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</field><field name="creator">Hodge, Sandra Joy.</field><field name="description">"April 2003" Bibliography: leaves 268-290. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) there is inadequate repair of the chronically damaged and inflamed airway epithelium. There is a school of thought that this inadequate repair may result from an accumulation of apoptotic material in the airways, resulting in secondary necrosis, tissue destruction and chronic inflammation. This thesis is an investigation of apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells on COPD using samples of peripheral blood, and bronchial brushings and bronchial lavage obtained from the airways during fibreoptic bronchoscopy. It also describes the development of a number of new methods to investigate the biologic specimens. The findings from this thesis indicate that failure to resolve epithelial damage and chronic inflammation in COPD may result, at least partially from increased apoptosis, increased activation of apoptotic pathways and defective clearance of apoptopic material by alveolar macrophages.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phh6885.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screening for low bone mineral density in patients with respiratory disease</field><field name="creator">Laslett, Laura Louise.</field><field name="description">"October, 2003" Bibliography: leaves 204-223.

The aim of this thesis was to examine the impact of psychological factors on stress responses to, and recovery from, surgery. As part of the study patients were offered access to additional information in the form of an educational video. Conclusions drawn from the study are that there appear to be no additional benefits in terms of patient outcomes by allowing patients to choose whether or not they want additional information. However, exposure to the video had some significant positive outcomes for patients, inluding increasing their recall of knowledge about the procedure and decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity following the completion of the procedure.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09php3613.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hitler on Lygon Street : Lily Brett and second generation Jewish suffering</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Shannon.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phd747.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:26388959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volfgangs D&#257;rzi&#326;&#353; (1906-1962) : a response to Latvian music traditions in emigration</field><field name="creator">Biezaitis, Mara.</field><field name="description">"Articles by Volfgangs D&#257;rzi&#326;&#353;": leaves 168-171.

This study is a response to these increasing rates of intervention, as reflected in the research question: 'What is shaping the practice of health professionals and the understanding of the public in relation to increasing intervention in childbirth?'  The participants in the study were nine health professionals: midwives and obstetricians, who were interviewed individually, and thirty-three members of the public who took part in six focus groups.  The research was carried out under the umbrella of critical hermeneutics, and the particular approach used was that of critical interpretation as formulated by Hans Kogler.  This approach enabled a hermeneutical thematic analysis of that which is shaped (worldviews) and a critical structural analysis (discursive orders, social practices, relationships of power and structures of domination) of the shaping and shapers of practice and understanding. The research process facilitated by critical interpretation in identifying and describing the shaping and shapers of practice and understanding adds an important dimension to the statistical picture of increasing intervention that is of concern, both to health professionals and the public.  The research revealed that the everyday world and its associated processes of socialisation in the 21st century - in particular pain, choice, and technology - shape the practice of health professionals and the understanding of the public in relation to increasing intervention.  The study's findings were supported by the revelation that many of the social and cultural values, such as convenience, ease, and control, that underpin Western society in the 21st century, correlate with what intervention has to offer, which results in intervention being increasingly sought after and utilised.  This milieu of intervention, which increasingly surrounds childbirth, is shown to be calling into question those things that have traditionally been at the heart of childbirth: the ability of the woman to birth and the clinical skills of the health professional. This research provides insight and awareness of those things that are shaping understanding and practice and birth itself and creating a milieu in which intervention is increasingly normalised.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Caesarean</field><field name="subject">C-section</field><field name="subject">Epidural</field><field name="subject">Critical hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protecting management information systems: Virtual Private Network competitive advantage</field><field name="creator">Sirisukha, Sid</field><field name="description">Information security technologists and business scholars are motivated by a desire to understand how and to what extent the application of IT within enterprise systems leads to improved and secured organizational performance. An effective relationship between business and IT professionals is a primary determinant of success in gaining business advantage through the enterprise system. As business innovation has relied increasingly on partnerships between business and IT professional, a different perspective of how IT professionals view their organizational contributions was needed for organizations to remain competitive. Business knowledge is essential if IT professionals are to create linkages with other organizational units and have a wider perspective about business objectives, thus achieving fit between IT and organizational strategies. Organizations have started responding to this challenge by demanding more business acumen in their IT staff. The focus of this study is on the knowledge that is beyond that of independent business and IT only domain knowledge of information security. Therefore, technical areas of knowledge, such as hardware and software, all of which are closely associated with IT skills, are not discussed in this thesis. This is not to declare that such knowledge is not important. Clearly technical knowledge is part of the IT professional's overall information security technology expertise, but this study is about the organization proficiency of business and the IT professional, and is therefore interested in what enables business and IT professionals to apply their business domain and technical knowledge in ways that are beneficial to the organization and to act cooperatively with their customers and business partners. The purpose of this study is to employ the triangulation method to identify the theoretical links and empirically examine the association between business and IT perspective of information security. An important contribution of this study is the identification of business and IT perspectives on information security technology. By establishing the link between business and IT, the study focuses and evaluates Virtual Private Network (VPN) as an information security technology to find out if VPN can secure and gain competitive advantage by partisan business process and organization performance. This study articulates distinctive characteristics of Virtual Private Network and management processes that extend the range of applicability across diverse business segments. It distinguishes between business and IT and explains why the exploitation of a complementary set of related information security entities (such as VPN) across multiple functions create competitive vi advantages even across a diverse set of businesses that have limited opportunity to exploit business process and organization performance. The most important direct predictor of this study is a high level of communication between business and IT. However, one cannot mandate meaningful communication between individuals. IT people have to earn the right to play a meaningful role in management forums. Based on the findings from this study, one important way for an IT person to be heard is for him/her to devote the time necessary to create competitive advantage and develop shared domain knowledge, the most influential construct in the research model. An IT person needs to understand the leverage points of the industry, the history and current issues of the business units, and to learn to apply business oriented objectives in the application of technology to business problems. This change in view would help focus their attention on security technology and ideas that could produce the most benefit and create competitive advantage, rather than those that offer the most technical promise.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual Private Network</field><field name="subject">VPN</field><field name="subject">Competitive advantages</field><field name="subject">Management information system</field><field name="subject">Empirical methods</field><field name="subject">Descriptive methods</field><field name="subject">Interpretive methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' motivation to learn, academic achievement, and academic advising</field><field name="creator">Henning, Marcus A</field><field name="description">Numerous models of academic advising address the complex nature of student retention and attrition. Most tend to ignore the subtleties of implementing motivational and self-regulatory changes associated with academic advising. This present study investigates the learning experiences of university students and their use of academic advising. The research incorporates an educational model as its primary investigative lens, namely Hirsch's (2001) multiple intervention model. The study further examined critical areas of learning and advising, specifically motivation, self-regulation, academic difficulty, and academic achievement.This research was conducted at a New Zealand university and comprised of three studies. In the first study, 14 participants were interviewed about their academic problems, readiness for study and use of learning and study strategies. In the second, a total of 317 participants completed a demographic survey and two questionnaires measuring aspects of motivation and self-regulation. In the third study, 147 participants completed follow-up self-report questionnaires. The mixed-paradigm analyses were twofold. Study 1 utilised a meaning-centred approach to classifying and understanding the interview responses. Studies 2 and 3 incorporated multivariate and categorical statistical procedures.Interview narratives from Study 1 suggested that students experiencing academic difficulty tended to voice more problems, to be less ready for study and to be more avoidance oriented than students not experiencing academic difficulty. In Study 2 students indicating low motivation levels for study had more self-perceived problems in the areas of concentration, self-monitoring, use of educational materials and developing time management than students with higher motivation levels. In addition, students with academic difficulty appeared to have more problems with motivation and use of study material than students with no evidence of academic difficulty. Students' motivation levels tended to vary over time indicating that students may perceive their rationale for study as an unfixed or malleable entity. Student attitude at the beginning of the academic semester significantly predicted grade outcome. Motivation and self-regulation response measures obtained immediately prior to the examination period, however, were unable to predict end-of-semester grade averages. In Study 3 completion of short group-based study skills programmes appears to have a link with end of semester grade average, but there were no significant shifts in measures of motivation and self-regulation. Students accessing one-to-one academic advising services were usually students with higher levels of motivation for study. The use of one-to-one academic counselling, however, was not determined by academic difficulty.Overall, the studies contribute a systematic and integrative process of investigating the area of academic advising. The research highlights the importance of goal orientations and students' initial perceptions about the value of their course of study in relation to academic achievement and in reference to the seeking of academic assistance from academic advising services. The findings suggest that although Hirsch's (2001) model provides a valuable framework to investigate ways students study and learn, it requires additional refinement especially in areas of categorisation and application before it can be confidently endorsed. The findings also indicate that academic advisory services provide a valuable service for students in terms of academic achievement, but further research is required in the areas of cultivating motivation and self-regulation changes, and especially in the area of affect development. Finally, the study confirms the worth of mixed-paradigm research and the need for more in depth research in the multifaceted world of academic advising.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Self-regulation</field><field name="subject">Academic advising</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand travel agents in the internet era: impacts, responses, and relationships</field><field name="creator">Garkavenko, Vladimir</field><field name="description">The impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is a significant issue in today's tourism industry. The development of the internet has made information easily accessible to consumers, and has therefore established a direct link between consumers and suppliers. As a result, traditional travel distribution channels are changing rapidly. A major feature of this change is "disintermediation", with principals such as airlines, hotels and rental car chains bypassing intermediaries and sell directly to consumers. Travel agents (TAs) are considered to be particularly vulnerable to this process. ICTs have the potential to replace their core competencies, which include transaction processing (ticketing and settlement) and information provision (raw product information provided by suppliers).This thesis focuses on the impact of ICTs on the TA sector, and specifically on the New Zealand TA case. A theoretical approach based on regulation theory  combined with a mixed method approach was used to investigate the main issues in New Zealand. The research included a case study to identify the principal issues and trends in the TA sector, in-depth interviews with TAs and industry specialists to refine the main issues and allow the formulation of some theoretical assumptions, in-depth interviews with consumers regarding the role of TAs in the internet era and the quality of service they provide, and a fully-structured, national on-line survey of TAs to verify the assumptions made in the earlier interviews and test the applicability of the post-Fordism model for the New Zealand TA sector.Based on the findings, it is argued that disintermediation is particularly pronounced in the relationship between airlines and travel agents. To minimise the risk of disintermediation and improve business performance, TAs need to reposition themselves and review their core strategies to compete efficiently in the changing business environment. The thesis reveals that consumers perceive TAs as mainly "transaction facilitators". Nevertheless the thesis show that process of "reintermediation" is a reality for some New Zealand TAs.An application of regulation theory to the New Zealand TA case reveals that in its traditional form, the regulation theory cannot explain the complexities found in the modern TA environment. The thesis reveals several distinct modes in TA perceptions of their business environment and their survival strategies, which indicates a heterogeneous, clustered population. A "formula for success" is developed for TAs in New Zealand. In this respect, TAs that perceive ICT as a strategic tool and are orientated towards consumers appear to have a business advantage.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Travel agency</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technology (ICT)</field><field name="subject">Tourist bookings</field><field name="subject">Direct sales</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of brief-intermittent hypoxic exposure on high-intensity kayaking and cycling performance</field><field name="creator">Bonetti, Darrell</field><field name="description">Adaptation to the shortage of oxygen at altitude (hypoxia) promotes physiological changes which could enhance endurance performance.  Consequently, altitude training has become a popular practice among competitive endurance athletes. Since its inception, the live-high train-low paradigm (LHTL) has been widely regarded as the most effective approach to altitude training. Over the past decade, brief intermittent simulation of LHTL via the use of hypoxic inhalers and re-breathing devices has gained increased popularity, but the evidence supporting their use is limited and conflicting. The experimental studies in this thesis investigated the response of sea level exercise performance and related physiological measures following adaptation to the usual and a novel protocol of brief intermittent hypoxia.  I intended to perform all experimental studies on flat-water kayakers.  Therefore, an initial requirement of this thesis was to establish the smallest worthwhile effect in performance for this sport. The final study utilising a meta-analytic approach was conducted to compare the effectiveness of brief intermittent hypoxia to other natural and simulated protocols, and to investigate the topical issue of what physiological responses mediate performance changes following hypoxic exposure.  In Study 1, the typical variation in competitive performance of elite flat-water canoeists was investigated using a repeated-measures analysis of race times.  For individual flat-water canoeing events, the smallest worthwhile change in performance time was ~0.5%. In two separate experimental studies, adaptation to 60 min per day of brief intermittent hypoxia consisting of alternating 5 min intervals of hypoxia and normoxia for 3 weeks (5 days per week) using a nitrogen filtration device resulted in clear enhancement of endurance performance (~5%) for kayakers (Study 2) and cyclists (Study 3). Clear enhancements in repeat sprint performance were observed for kayaking only. The physiological mechanisms underlying performance changes were unclear.  Modification of the hypoxic and normoxic intervals (Study 3) did not result in any clear alterations in performance or physiological mechanisms.  The meta-analysis (Study 4) revealed clear enhancements in endurance power output of 1-3%  in sub-elites following adaptation to hypoxia with the natural altitude protocols, and with two of the artificial-altitude protocols (LHTL-long and LHTL-brief-intermittent). In elite athletes the enhancements tended to be smaller and were clear only for the natural protocols. These enhancements could be mediated by VO2max, although other mechanisms may be possible.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hypoxia, Kayaking, Cycling, High intensity exercise</field><field name="subject">Sports training</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative accountability in the Ugandan community-led HIV/AIDS programme</field><field name="creator">Awio, Godwin</field><field name="description">Internationally, many public sector reform initiatives have been undertaken over the last three decades under the label New Public Management (NPM), with improvements in accountability and management among their main objectives. This thesis draws on social capital theory to examine the potential of a Ugandan community-led HIV/AIDS programme to supplement NPM approaches to public service delivery and accountability. Hermeneutics methodology is used to guide the research design and the interpretation of evidence.The findings of this study suggest that Uganda's community-led HIV/AIDS initiatives operate within a "bottom-up" accountability framework, characterized by the community taking a role in budgeting, program implementation, reporting, project-oversight, and audit activities. In regard to accounting practices, this study reveals that Ugandan community projects use basic and simple accounting procedures. The findings suggest that simple communal accountability mechanisms can compensate for the types of formal control mechanisms typically promoted within NPM-style reforms. The findings also suggest that multiple accountability relationships can operate in the form of both hierarchical and lateral accountability practices and that these multiple accountability relationships lead to tighter control and accurate accountability, even though formal accountability mechanisms may be weak.This study identified some challenges for community-led service delivery initiatives, including the potential for corrupt practices in some community groups and variations in the level of participation of group members in the execution of various tasks. Further, several areas for further research have been identified. These include the measurement of social capital within community groups and the establishment of measures of group capacities.This study has revealed the latent accountability technology of a "bottom-up" communitarian accountability framework and demonstrated its potential as a complement to NPM models of service delivery and accountability. As an accountability innovation, it needs to be keenly watched as further field experiences emerge over time and reveal more of its potential in developing countries, and perhaps beyond.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uganda</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Social capital</field><field name="subject">Accounting practice</field><field name="subject">Pubic sector reform</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The poetics of making</field><field name="creator">Ho, King Tong</field><field name="description">This is a practice-led research project that seeks to explore the cross-cultural aesthetics and conceptual ideas of an art project.

Through this process, the aesthetics and conceptual ideas of both cultures will be explored, examined, analysed and interrogated for the potential development of a new aesthetics in the context of digital art. There are three major components in this research project; a creative document in the form of a collection of artwork, an exegesis and a collection of documentation. The creative document will be a body of visual image-based artwork that includes a series of collateral works from the ongoing research and practice of the project. It is the negotiated output of a potentially new aesthetics in digital art, specifically in the context of digital still imaging and digital printmaking. The exegesis is an analytical and critical commentary that places the creative document in relevant theoretical, philosophical, cultural and historical contexts. The documentation is a collection of the ongoing empirical practice of ink jet technology on Xuan Zhi. The visual physical form of both the exegesis and the documentation are also included as part of the creative document.

The test has attracted considerable criticism from health professionals, academics, judges and lawyers for being ill-defined and non-specific. The question of what is meant by 'best interests' remains largely unanswered. As a consequence, the test gives medical and legal decision makers considerable discretion to apply their personal value judgements within supposedly value-free philosophical frameworks - unreasoned and opaque decision making processes are the inevitable result. Because of the dominance of supposedly value-free philosophical frameworks, the place of values in decision making is not always fully understood. Reasoning is not possible without values, which stem from our emotions and passions, our upbringing, our religion, our cultures, our processes of socialisation and from our life experiences. Values help us make sense of our daily lives.  I argue that law - like any other social institution - is essentially a human, values based construct. I put forward a theory of values-based law which argues for the recognition that laws, rules and conventions are based on, and contain, individual values. Currently, medical and legal decision makers justify grave decisions on behalf of society's most vulnerable citizens without revealing, or even acknowledging the values which drive and inform their decisions. Any opportunities to scrutinise or debate the values driving decisions are lost. Ultimately, values-based law argues that values underlying best interest determinations must be exposed to facilitate honest, transparent and fulsome decision making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. By applying the theory of values-based law, supposedly value-free decision making processes are exposed as insufficient to facilitate fulsome, honest and transparent legal reasoning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophical analysis</field><field name="subject">Bad faith</field><field name="subject">Kuhn</field><field name="subject">Scientific revolutions</field><field name="subject">Objectivism</field><field name="subject">State of nature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling of an electroactive polymer hydrogel for optical applications</field><field name="creator">Paxton, Robert Alan</field><field name="description">In this work a finite element model is proposed to describe the swelling of poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels under the influence of an external electric field. The specific application of this model is for optical applications, but the design could be used equally well for other applications such as sensors and actuators.The model is proposed as five individual modules, which work in conjunction with each other but which can also function independently. This independence allows the model to provide intermediate results to the user, and also permits each module to be improved or adjusted individually without affecting the operation of the overall model. The first module is the Electrical module, which calculates the external electric field present in the hydrogel by solving Laplace's equation. The second module is the Chemical module, which uses the electric field to calculate the diffusion and migration of ions through the hydrogel/solvent regions. The third module is the Force module, which uses the change in ion concentrations to calculate the resulting change in osmotic pressure (force). This force is then used in the Mechanical module to calculate the deformation of the hydrogel, based on the assumption of linear elasticity. Finally, the fifth module is the Optical module, which uses the deformation to calculate the theoretical change in focal length.To verify the operation of the model, numerous experiments were conducted with the deformation of a poly(acrylic acid) hydrogel being measured under various external voltages with different electrode configurations. Overall, the model agrees quite well with the experimental results, but also highlights some interesting discrepancies that will need to be considered in future work. There is also some scope for improvement in the experimental method used, but again this is left for future work.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="subject">Polymer colloids</field><field name="subject">Ophthalmic lenses</field><field name="subject">Colloids</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acid hydrolysis of neutral glycosphingolipids</field><field name="creator">Nardan, Denise</field><field name="description">Blood group glycolipids are important tools in the study of microbial receptor interactions and other biological phenomena. Presently blood group glycolipids of interest are isolated from biological samples. However, all glycolipids are not readily available due to the low frequency of some phenotypes in the general population. The ability to acquire the rare glycolipids from the degradation of common glycolipids would be a useful alternative to trying to obtain the molecules from biological sources.This research set out to establish the ability of blood group glycolipids to be degraded into useful glycolipids in a controlled manner by acid hydrolysis and possibly metal catalysis. The initial experiments investigated the degradation/hydrolysis of the more readily available glycolipid globoside with a range of salts and acids to establish degradation concepts such as; temperature, type of acid, acid concentration, and the role of metal ions in glycolipid degradation. These concepts then led to a series of degradation experiments with the blood group glycolipids Leb and ALeb. These glycolipids were incubated with a range of acid concentrations and varying temperatures. Thin layer chromatography separation and chemical and immunochemical staining were the main methods used to identify the products of degradation.It was established that metal ions were not directly involved in the catalysis of glycolipids in the short-term, however some metal ions were indirectly implicated in their degradation due to their ability to form acid solutions. Acid hydrolysis was established as the principle mechanism for glycan chain degradation. In general it was found that the glycan chain primarily lost its fucose groups (in no particular order) and was then followed by sequential degradation of the remaining glycan chain. The glycan chain also appeared to have a protective function on the ceramide moiety.  Degradation of globoside established a simple sequential pathway of glycan chain reduction from the non-reducing end. Blood group glycolipids ALeb and Leb first lost their fucose side groups followed by sequential reduction of the glycan chain. Although not fully controllable, degradation of Leb was able to produce Lea, Led and Lec. In contrast degradation of ALeb did not produce any Lea or Led. Instead A-type 1 and two novel A-like structures, 'linear A' and 'GalNAc-Lea' were generated. Lec was only produced from ALeb in extremely acidic conditions. This research established the ability to generate, by acid hydrolysis, a range of rare and "unnatural" novel glycolipids from more commonly available structures. It is of interest that the so-called unnatural glycolipids obtained from the acid hydrolysis of ALeb may, in theory, occur naturally in the acid environment of the stomach, and as such could have the potential to be implicated in disease. It is probable that by applying the principles learned here, a range of novel and natural structures suitable for use in the study of biological interactions can be obtained.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid hydrolysis</field><field name="subject">Glycosidic bonds</field><field name="subject">Lewis blood groups</field><field name="subject">Fucose</field><field name="subject">glycolipids</field><field name="subject">A Lewis b</field><field name="subject">Lewis b</field><field name="subject">Lewis c</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification, transport and treatment of adhered deleterious substances of stormwater in an urban catchment</field><field name="creator">Ng, Warren Heng Wan</field><field name="description">This thesis develops and presents a practical, rapid and cost effective method of assessing the most efficient strategy to limit sediment and associated contaminants from entering and impacting on Auckland's waterways. Although sediment removal objectives have been defined by Auckland Regional Council's stormwater quality guidelines, the deployment of treatment systems based upon current best management practice does not ensure that these objectives will be achieved. Due to the lack of established methods for the collection and analysis of stormwater related contaminants, an elaborate sampling and analytical protocol was established to validate the results obtained. The research has been undertaken as a series of studies with specific sampling methodology described in detail at the beginning of each study. Current issues and practices relating to the local stormwater industry are also reviewed.The accumulation of metal contaminants in estuarine studies is typically considered in terms of the preferential accumulation of heavy metals in the sediment fine fraction and the accumulation of these contaminants in the bulk sediment. For these data to be considered in the context of stormwater treatment, a third factor, looking at the total mass load distribution of these contaminants within the particle ranges of sediment is introduced. This thesis proposes that a substantial amount of coarser particles are making their way into our receiving environment and that attached to them are a significant proportion of the total contaminant load. Although the contaminants on coarse particles may not be bioavailable in their original state, they undergo physical changes while in transport and once deposited the chemical and biological effects on the receiving environment will ultimately be just as detrimental.A contaminant yield assessment method is developed in which the removal efficiency of every stormwater contaminant can be accessed based on a target sediment removal range. From a cost-benefit perspective, the marginal benefit of higher contaminant removal is also discussed. Finally the framework of a contaminant-based stormwater model, incorporating provenance, nature and transport is developed to access the true nature of stormwater contamination discharged to the receiving environment. The model will generate generic particle and contaminant distributions, which may be used by policy makers to predict treatment efficiencies based on target sediment removal objectives.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urban runoff</field><field name="subject">Storm sewers</field><field name="subject">Water pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power relationships within a corporate finance department: a Foucauldian approach to corporate hierarchies and resistance</field><field name="creator">Garland, Angela M</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis investigates power relationships within a corporate Finance Department employing a Foucauldian approach to explaining corporate hierarchies and resistance and the implications.Research was conducted in the form of a case study and observation of a corporate finance department, referred to as the 'Finance Department', at the 'Company', referred to as such for confidentiality purposes. The Company is a large Dutch based mail and logistics entity that operates internationally across over 200 countries and has its corporate head office just outside of Amsterdam. The Company's Finance Department was in the throws of change, particularly around hierarchies as a result of the reengineering process with the purpose of creating efficiencies. The aim of the research was to evaluate the power relationships that existed within the hierarchies between management and workers who worked either for the Finance Department or closely with it, and to analyse the outcomes of these power relationships in terms of resistance.The case study is a Foucauldian insight into the different individuals who worked either within the Finance Department or closely with it, with an evaluation of their roles and how their differing power structures impacted upon the workflow within the Finance Department.The outcome of this research is an evaluation of those individuals and their relationships at a particular point in time, which was impacted by so many different factors. The research could give readers an understanding of power relationships and framework for contextual Foucauldian evaluation.The significance of the contribution arising from this particular piece of research is that it involves the combination of a case study method with a Foucauldian perspective. The combination of these two elements allows the research to be done both from the top down and also from the bottom up. Increasing in use as a research tool (Hamel, 1992), the case study contributes uniquely to our body of knowledge of individual, organisational, social and political phenomena (Yin, 1994). The Foucauldian perspective plays an important part in terms of an understanding of power, despite the fact that it is often difficult to fully comprehend the meanings behind Foucault's work (McHoul &amp; Grace, 1993).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glass ceiling</field><field name="subject">Business hierarchy</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured interviews</field><field name="subject">Interpretive approach</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of trade liberalisation on economic structure and performance: case of the OECS</field><field name="creator">Samuel, Thomas</field><field name="description">In keeping with global liberalisation trends and impelled by external liberalisation in terms of eroding preferential treatment in their principal export markets, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)1 together with the wider Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) region, has since 1993 embraced a policy of trade liberalisation as a strategy for growth and development. In large measure this was done through the phased implementation of a Common External Tariff (CET) involving a progressive lowering of tariff rates over the period, 1993-1998. The theoretical arguments in support of this policy change are based on the assumption of a positive link between trade liberalisation and economic growth. They contend that trade reforms that increase the outward-orientation/openness of trade regimes would result in structural change that reallocate resources in line with comparative advantage leading to exportled growth. This will then be followed by faster economic growth as countries benefit from efficiency gains, technology spillovers and other positive externalities.The thesis empirically assesses these claims against the nature of the impact of trade liberalisation on: (i) the export structure of the OECS and (ii) its economic growth performance. Using a comparative analysis in a dichotomous framework of ten-years before and after the policy reforms we find that in general the predictions of the underlying neo-classical trade model are not supported by the empirical evidence. There were indications of structural changes in exports in terms of reduced specialisation and competitiveness of traditional sectors and a steady shift of the macro-economy away from commodity production both agriculture and manufacturing towards services. Meanwhile the evidence suggests a revenue-neutral fiscal impact and no indication of systematic increase in technology transfer over the post-reform period.Using alternative estimation specifications in a single or simultaneous framework with and without fixed effects in a panel data setting, trade liberalisation was repeatedly found to be negatively associated with growth. In contrast openness was found to be positively correlated with both growth and export performance. At best a J-curve type impact of trade reforms on economic growth is deduced suggesting a long period of adjustment. However prospects for sustained growth seem remote on current indications suggesting the need for a reform of the international trade rules to cater to the special needs of LDCs and SIDS. In this pursuit a plausible alternative approach to the mode of implementation of trade liberalisation in is presented.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transport-related physical activity, health outcomes, and urban design: descriptive evidence</field><field name="creator">Badland, Hannah M</field><field name="description">Environments that support physical activity (PA) engagement are now seen as an important part of the solution for accumulating daily physical activity which confers health benefits, particularly transport-related PA (TPA). Despite this recognition, understanding the determinants of health-related PA has traditionally focused on identifying associations between the social environment and non-specific PA domains. As such, prior to commencing this thesis little was known about the relationships between the built environment and overall PA engagement within the New Zealand context. Little was also known about associations between TPA attitudes and behaviours, and urban design. This research sought to overcome this paucity of knowledge by investigating associations between overall PA and TPA engagement and perceptions, health outcomes, urban design, and socio-demographic variables from a public health perspective. The body of research was initiated with two literature reviews that formed the context for the following six empirical chapters. Data in the empirical chapters were drawn from three self-report surveys using adult samples. The research commenced by examining associations between urban design and overall PA engagement, and then narrowed towards TPA-specific relationships. TPA relationships were identified through the development and implementation of a reliable survey that captured associated behaviours and attitudes. Several new findings were drawn from this body of work. Overall, 21% of adults recognised they could replace automobile journeys on at least two days per week, and walking was deemed an acceptable travel alternative. Adult TPA engagement levels were low; 7% commuted to place of work/study and 32% travelled to the convenience shop by TPA modes. Furthermore, when compared with those who commuted to an occupation by TPA, respondents who used motorised travel were less likely to be classified as active (odds ratio (OR)=0.5) and be of normal body mass index (OR=0.5). No significant health relationships existed for convenience shop travel. As well, 4% of adults reported no automobile availability. When this group was compared with those with unrestricted automobile availability, they were less likely to be classified as active (OR=0.3), but were more likely to engage in TPA modes to access destinations (occupation, OR=6.3; convenience shop, OR=9.8). Occupation-related commute distances also revealed interesting findings. Overall, 50% of respondents perceived they could, and 10% of the sample actually did, commute by TPA modes for distances less than five kilometres, and relationships were strongly mediated by distance. Other urban design variables were objectively assessed with TPA engagement for occupation-related commute distances less than five kilometres. Those who travelled along the most connected street networks were more likely to engage in TPA modes (OR=6.9) when compared with respondents travelling along the least connected networks. No relationships were found with other urban design variables and TPA engagement.This research substantially contributes to this research area by identifying associations between overall PA and TPA engagement and perceptions with urban design. It is likely that shifting the perceptions of adults who recognise they can employ TPA modes, into actual TPA engagement will result in promising population health gains. Future PA initiatives with adults should consider promoting walking for transport as a sustainable solution. A lack of TPA interventions is evident; however, methodological issues need to be resolved before developing such initiatives. Although strategies aimed towards changing perceptions may be valuable for future TPA interventions, it is likely macro-scale urban design modifications (e.g., improved job-housing balance, highly-grained street networks) and legislation (e.g., automobile restrictions) will have the greatest success for increasing TPA engagement in the adult population.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="subject">built environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate social responsibility in Islam</field><field name="creator">Mohammed, Jawed  A</field><field name="description">Notions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have been suggested to be consistent with an Islamic view of society. Indeed, values and principles that have been central to Islam since the time of the holy Prophet Mohammed (Peace and Blessings be upon him) may serve as a foundation for notions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) similar to those in the West. Much contemporary discussion of CSR, however, has not recognized this. These discussions have largely been based on a Western orientation informed by Western religious values. Moreover, CSR has evolved literally in response to particular issues or problems that are specific to businesses in a Western context. This led to a lack of a comprehensive global context within which a wider perspective of CSR should be positioned. On the other hand, the notion of social responsibility and justice has been an integral part of Islamic society for nearly 14 centuries. However, the Islamic literature remains scattered, fragmented and lacks a coherent framework that would allow such a concept in Islam to be systematized. While Islamic philosophy is rich in precepts pertinent to CSR, these precepts have not yet been formally synthesized to present a systematic model with an explicit notion of CSR in Islam. Thus, there exists a gap in both the Western and Islamic literature. This was fruitfully exploited in this study to advance the understanding of the concept of CSR in a wider cultural and religious setting. This study explored this new territory and presented a conceptual framework of CSR in Islam based on Shariah (the Islamic legal and social system) derived from the holy Qur'an and Hadith. It provided both, a counterpart and a comparable base in the study of various issues relevant to CSR and international business from a much wider global perspective. It also provided significant insights into Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) regarding business practice. The consistency of the conceptual framework of CSR in Islam with contemporary business practices was explored using a survey of Islamic banks located in different parts of the world. The survey revealed that many current practices of Islamic banks mirror the expected behaviours or practices generated in the Islamic framework. In fact, it was possible to discern that the organizations surveyed implement the Islamic code of conduct rather extensively. Against this background, a consistency with the framework of CSR in Islam presented in this study was identified. Such consistency, however, was driven by legal requirements in adherence to Shariah rather than an explicit understanding or pursuit of CSR. The lack of a systematic framework with explicit notions of CSR from an Islamic perspective caused hindrance in implementing CSR practices in Islamic organizations. It follows that this study was a modest step towards filling this lacuna by presenting a systematic and coherent framework of CSR in Islam.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic ethics</field><field name="subject">Islamic banking</field><field name="subject">Empirical survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secondary school students' self-efficacy in mathematics and achievement in diverse schools</field><field name="creator">Marat, Deepa</field><field name="description">Improving the achievement of students in New Zealand is a major commitment of the Government. In his report on the national education priorities, the Minister of Education (2003) clearly stipulates the key goals and strategies across the education system to improve educational outcomes. One of the two major goals, which is a part of the key priorities for the next three years, is to "reduce systematic underachievement in education" (p. 8). To attain this goal the focus of the Government will be, among others, to lift the achievement levels of the bottom 25% especially in literacy and numeracy, increase retention in senior secondary school, and increase achievement at higher tertiary levels by all cultural groups. Strategies focus on raising expectations for achievement of all learners, focusing on quality teaching, strengthening family and community involvement and focusing on learning outcomes. Fancy (2004), Secretary of Education in New Zealand, states that from the 1990s there is a shift in focus in the education sector from that of good administration to effective teaching and clearer expectations on student achievement. A crucial factor in achievement is self-efficacy. Research has been extensive on the relationship between self-efficacy and student achievement in academic settings. With increasing diversity in the student population, and wide disparities in achievement of students in New Zealand, the need to assess student self-efficacy emerges as a valuable source of evidence about students' self-beliefs in achievement in distinct subjects, and in the use of cognitive, motivational, self-regulatory strategies and related determinants of achievement. The concept of self-efficacy is based on the triadic reciprocality model symbolising a relationship between: (a) personal factors i.e., cognition, emotion, and biological events, (b) behaviour, and (c) environmental factors (Maddux, 1995). Cognition, emotion and behaviour are the domains of personality which form the basis of research in self-efficacy. Self-report scales are most commonly used in the assessment of self-efficacy. The guidelines to construct scales to assess selfefficacy have been specified by Bandura (2001). These guidelines highlight the importance of developing self-report measures which are task specific, and take into consideration all three domains of self-efficacy and three levels within each domain. Suggestions to develop measures which are reliable and have content validity have been provided in the guidelines. Self efficacy is viewed as a multidimensional construct which shares a reciprocal relationship with various determinants of learning and achievement. The determinants considered in the present study include: (a) motivation strategies, (b) cognitive strategies, (c) resource management, (d) self-regulated learning, (e) meeting others' expectations, and (f) self-assertiveness. The major aims of the present research are to assess diverse students' self-efficacy in mathematics, and the relationship between self-efficacy and achievement. Students' self-efficacy in the use of specific learning strategies is further explored. Teachers' beliefs in the use of learning strategies within the classroom context are also surveyed. Situated in multicultural schools with groups of diverse students, participants were students who opted for mathematics in Form VI and Form VII from three schools, and mathematics teachers from one of the secondary schools. In Phase I, self-efficacy is assessed in the context of the three domains; that is, cognitive, behavioural and emotional self-efficacy. A survey of students and teachers' self beliefs in the use of learning strategies is undertaken in Phase II of the study. The scores on the scales of self-efficacy in mathematics and in use of learning strategies are correlated with students' achievement results in mathematics. While the findings from the study show students reporting moderately high levels of self-efficacy, the perceived levels of self-efficacy in the different domains is not reflected in achievement in mathematics. The reasons for this incongruence is explored in the context of student achievement trends, and the wider socio-cultural and historical context of New Zealand society, with recommendations including a four-point strategy to raise achievement of students.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">Self psychology</field><field name="subject">Motivation in education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incidental focus on form in teacher-learner interaction and learner-learner interaction</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Susan Yuqin</field><field name="description">Current attention in L2 acquisition research has been given to the integration of message-focused and form-focused instruction. One way to accomplish this is through the incidental focus on form during meaning-focused activities. Some studies have investigated incidental focus on form in different contexts and provided evidence that this incidental focus on form exists in L2 classes and that it facilitates L2 acquisition.The present study conducted further research into the effects of interactional patterns (Teacher-learner and Learner-learner) and learners' proficiency levels (Advanced and Elementary) on the features of incidental focus on form (types of focus on form; types of feedback; linguistic forms focused on and types of immediate uptake). Over 10 hours of interactions with meaning-focused communication tasks were audio recorded in two interactional patterns and in two classes. The 336 focus on form episodes (FFEs) were transcribed and analyzed for four features of FFEs.The results revealed a significant difference in frequencies of FFE types between the two interactional patterns. Teachers were more active in responding to learners' errors, but they were less active in initiating preemptive FFEs. No significant difference was found between the two proficiency levels.In terms of feedback, no significant difference was found between the two interactional patterns. Both teachers and learners were using similar types of feedback in the FFEs. Learners were as able as their teachers in 'providing solutions'. Thus, Learner-learner interactions appear to be equally beneficial for L2 learning. Equally, there was no difference between the two proficiency levels. In terms of linguistic focus, there was no significant difference between the two interactional patterns or between the two proficiency levels.In terms of overall uptake responses, there was a significant difference between the two interactional patterns, mainly in terms of 'no uptake', 'no opportunity for uptake' and 'no need for uptake'. However, there was no significant difference in terms of frequencies of 'occurrence of uptake'. Thus, Learner-learner interactions appear to be equally beneficial for L2 learning from the perspective of producing successful uptake. No significant difference in terms of immediate uptake was found between the two proficiency levels.The results of this study suggest that in both Teacher-learner and Learner-learner interactions at both Advanced and Elementary levels of proficiency, incidental FFEs occur frequently, and the high frequency of immediate uptake in these FFEs can be considered effective for L2 learning. Because learners were able to work as a knowledge source for each other, spoken interactions should be encouraged between learners.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">Teacher-student relationships</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accruals: signalling or misleading? Evidence from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Koerniadi, Hardjo</field><field name="description">Studies on earnings management usually hypothesise that managers manage accruals opportunistically. Few studies however, argue that managers can also use accruals to improve the value relevance of reported earnings to help investors better assess the firm's operating performance. While substantial evidence on managers' opportunistic behaviour on accruals has been documented in the literature, empirical evidence on the informativeness of accruals is scarce and inconclusive. The purpose of this thesis is to examine whether managers use accruals to communicate private information regarding the firm's operating performance, or as reported in the literature, use them for their own benefit.  This thesis finds that on average, firms reporting high earnings accompanied by high accruals have significantly negative subsequent period stock returns suggesting that these firms manage their accounting earnings. Focusing on stock dividend issues as an incentive to opportunistically increase accruals, the results are found to be consistent with the earnings management hypothesis. Stock dividend issuing firms are reported to significantly increase accruals in the issue year followed by poor earnings and stock price performances in the subsequent year. Moreover, discretionary accruals of the issuing firms are negatively correlated with both future earnings and abnormal stock returns. This evidence attempts to complement the earnings management literature. The analysis on the incentive to decrease accruals related to share repurchases, however, does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that managers use their discretion to decrease accruals. To investigate the hypothesis that managers use accruals to convey information regarding their firm's future profitability, this thesis employs the contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements as the research setting. This choice was made to increase the likelihood of detecting the use of accruals as private information communication while simultaneously mitigating the likelihood of the opportunistic income smoothing hypothesis to explain the results. The evidence strongly indicates that managers use both accruals and dividend increases as their private information communication regarding their firm's future profitability. Dividend increasing firms report positive accruals which are positively correlated with future profitability. This finding contributes to the literature by providing evidence on the accrual signalling hypothesis. Overall, the results of this thesis suggest that, depending on the incentives, managers can use the discretion accorded under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in estimating accounting accrual, either to manage accruals opportunistically or to help investors better assess the firms' operating performance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accruals</field><field name="subject">Earnings management</field><field name="subject">Signalling</field><field name="subject">Business finance</field><field name="subject">Market performance</field><field name="subject">Cross sectional Jones model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The philosophy and practice of holistic health care</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Deborah Ann</field><field name="description">For almost three decades 'holistic health care' has been a widely invoked term. It is called upon as an antidote to mechanistic science, as justification for the use of alternative therapies, as instruction to good practice and even as a boundary marker in establishing professional identity. In the service of these intentions it has assumed various meanings. The first aim of this study is to identify from the literature, the illusion of shared meaning that saturates this term and to expose the implications of this lack of clarity. The elusive nature of the meanings attributed to holism and the problem of determining an appropriate method of pursuing these meanings is addressed. A particular understanding of conceptual analysis and practical reasoning are defended as adequate tools. The group of ideas from which the term holism can be distinguished, individualism, dualism and reductionism, form the context of the examination of understandings of wholeness. Eight distinctions of wholeness are examined and the common conceptual feature of 'purpose' is suggested. This requires considerable justification which is provided by an exploration of the notion of 'partness'. Recourse to the seminal work of Smuts (1926) is sought and the derivation of the idea of holism from evolution theory is explored. A key understanding explored is the nature of emergent properties and their role in the holistic doctrine, 'the whole is more than the sum of the parts'. Employment of the word holism in social science, philosophy, and biology is examined and a number of fallacies about holism exposed. With a somewhat clearer understanding of holism, and a working notion of wholeness, theories of health are discussed as contenders for a philosophical basis for 'holistic health care'. While several show some congruence, it is argued that the Foundations Theory of Health can be shown to demonstrate the characteristics of work for wholeness identified in this work. The conclusion that holistic health care is in essence working creatively with incipient wholes, is explained and justified by a discussion about how a health worker might become more holistic in her practice.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holistic medicine</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MICE and local economic development in New Zealand : defining a role for the Web</field><field name="creator">Lau, Kam Hong Chloe</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how information and communication technologies (ICT), particularly the World Wide Web (Web), can contribute to the role that Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Conventions, and Exhibitions (MICE) properties play in local economic development (LED).

Despite at least eight years of learning English, most students still cannot communicate effectively in English. This phenomenon has been described in China as 'Dumb English'. The Government and tertiary educators recognised the problem reforming the curriculum and related educational policy. One of the main reforms has been the inclusion of 'group discussion' into the learning of English. However, despite this initiative to date many students have remained passively silent in these discussions, thus decreasing the discussion's effectiveness in promoting spoken English fluency.This qualitative and interpretive research utilised the appreciative inquiry (AI) research approach in designing the research process. Data from the interviews of eighteen tertiary students was summarised into provocative propositions and developed from there into an action plan for use in the English education in China.The findings of this study included the discussion topic, the characteristics of the group members, and teacher's roles were the three most important factors enhancing active participation in the 'group discussion'. Provocative propositions, summarising the common themes emerging in the findings, were constructed. For example, most students were interested in simple, practical and familiar discussion topics. Based on the propositions, I explored an action plan outlining suggestions for English teachers in Chinese higher institutions to enhance their student's active participation in group discussion.I have surmised that student's active participation in English group discussions can be effectively increased by attending to discussion topics, student group characteristics and the teacher's roles. Simple and practical discussion topics, familiar and interactive group members and a teacher who often encourages students, knowing how to assist the learners effectively are all important factors that enhance student's participation in group discussions. Increased participation is likely to result in improved English fluency amongst Chinese students.I outlined some of the highlights and benefits of the study such as the importance of the discussion topic for second language learners, the characteristics of more successful student groups, and the importance of the teacher's role in facilitating group discussions. By contrast some limitations of this research included the similarity of the student's responses as this might suggest a limited range of students, as well as having all the participants from one institution.

As an orthopaedic nurse I had concerns that the validity of orthopaedic nursing as a unique scope of practice was being questioned. In this thesis, the case for orthopaedic nursing is argued, by showing it as a specialty in its own right.A qualitative approach informed by my interpretation of philosophical hermeneutics as articulated by Heidegger (1927/1962) and Gadamer (1976; 1989) was undertaken. Phenomenology seeks to uncover 'taken-forgranted' meanings in everyday experience and hermeneutic research recognises that the historical and cultural horizons of participants and researcher influence the interpretation.Eight nurses working in various orthopaedic settings were interviewed. Data was analysed using the interpretive thematic approach described by van Manen (1990). The nurses' stories from practice yielded two essential themes, 'being part', and 'gaining and maintaining integrity'. These themes interrelate and together reveal meanings and insights about being an orthopaedic nurse. 'Being part', shows the essential nature of relationships between orthopaedic nurses and others. 'Gaining and maintaining integrity' describes the embodied nature of the phenomenon.The overall thematic finding 'seeing the world through orthopaedic eyes' reveals the nature of orthopaedic nursing as a unique scope of practice.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the supervision of occupational therapists in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Herkt, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore the nature and process of supervision of occupational therapists as it occurs in New Zealand. There has recently been an increased focus on supervision by the profession. This study is therefore timely in seeking to describe the phenomenon of supervision. The study had eleven participants with some of the participants agreeing to be interviewed in both capacities those of supervisee and supervisor; this resulted in interviews with eight supervisees and five supervisors. Grounded theory was chosen as the methodology for the study. This methodology ensures that the voices of the participants are heard and that the study remains focused on their understandings and the meanings that they make of the process of supervision. Grounded theory allows for the generation of a conceptual model of the experience. By using the constant comparative method of data analysis a core concept of participating in supervision emerged.Participating in supervision describes a process that is heavily dependent on the quality of the supervisory relationship. It identifies the factors that bring supervisees to supervision and places emphasis on supervisory relationships that allow supervisees to explore the concept of me as a therapist. It highlights the benefits in therapists gaining an understanding of the wider picture in which they practice. It emphasises the significance of contextual factors such as supervision contracts and training, and highlights the issues raised by the type of power the supervisor holds. Positional power was seen by participants to be detrimental to the outcome of supervision whereas social power was seen to empower supervisees and allow a deeper relationship to develop. The trust in such relationships enabled issues to be raised without fear of consequence, or threat to competence. Supervisors were tasked to build on supervisees' strengths but to also challenge supervisees' actions and plans.Supervisees entered supervision believing that they would grow as therapists. For some this was possible and they were able to make the most of supervision. Supervision gave them a safe place to go and to explore what was happening, it was affirming. It empowered them to integrate knowledge, skills and behaviours such that they came away with insights. Importantly supervisees felt inspired. For others, poor relationships and structures resulted in guarding. They felt the need to protect themselves and they began fighting shy of supervision. There was obvious avoidance and frustration with supervision. This study takes us a step closer to understanding the place and value of supervision in occupational therapy in New Zealand.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupational therapists</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/15</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dawn of new age tourism : an analysis of Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Pernecky, Tomas</field><field name="description">This thesis studies New Age tourism and New Age tourists in New Zealand. In order to better understand this phenomenon, the research reviews literature pertaining to spirituality, religious tourism, pilgrimage and sacred sites. Using the theory of strategic groups, the study also shows that New Age tourism is distinct from other forms of travelling.The thesis argues that as a New Age destination, New Zealand's rich natural and cultural resources present immense potential for development. Key New Age attractions in the country are identified and future development prospects discussed. Although a relatively new phenomenon, the research contends that the New Age market is not homogenous and visitors exhibit differences in 'interest', 'experience' and 'profile characteristics'. Nevertheless, a dominant theme in all New Age travel appears to be the pursuit of unique and transcendental life knowledge.To analyze the New Age tourists in detail, the study employs two research methodologies. Quantitatively, the profile characteristics of tourists are scrutinized and a specialization index is adopted to delineate differences between market segments. It will be shown that New Age tourists comprise three distinct groups: the low, medium and highly specialized individuals. Qualitatively, the New Age visitors are analyzed by means of a phenomenological method. Through in-depth understanding of their motivations, needs and opinions, the New Age traveller is seen to be constantly in search of extraordinary and life-changing experiences. Overall, the thesis demonstrates that a corroborative methodology combining quantitative and qualitative techniques provides not only a holistic view of New Age tourism, but also invaluable empirical insights into this burgeoning field of contemporary travel.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Age consumers</field><field name="subject">New Age movement</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/16</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of modernisation theory to phases in Maori development since 1800</field><field name="creator">Moon, Paul</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore the relationship between certain descriptive and prescriptive elements in Modernisation theory, and selected phases in Maori development in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This analysis also extends to consideration of the significance of intentional development, as defined by Michael Cowen and Robert Shenton (Cowen &amp; Shenton, 1996), as the emerging basis for such development.The particular focus within the theoretical framework is on the characteristics and implications of social transformation that are said to accompany rapid economic development - particularly for non-Western peoples living within an emerging Western economic environment. As a corollary of this, consideration is given to the evident conversion from such transitions being unplanned consequences of the forces of economic development, to the increasingly conscious, planned bases for the processes of modernisation being applied to Maori development.This thesis concludes that there has been a discernable intensification in the forces of modernisation impacting on Maori, and that this has been complemented by more deliberate efforts - at a governmental level - to advance this process. One consequence of this trend has been that the alternative models for Maori development have been virtually excluded, even from consideration by successive Governments, and that a singular theoretical model has become the near-universal standard for governmental discourse about this area of indigenous development in New Zealand.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Dependency</field><field name="subject">Maori Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/17</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tensions in the toolbox: the meaning of Western acupuncture for New Zealand physiotherapists</field><field name="creator">Kohut, Susan</field><field name="description">Physiotherapists in New Zealand are increasingly learning and practicing Western acupuncture. Western acupuncture as a new and different tool is enhancing and yet challenging physiotherapists practice. This study explores the meaning behind Western acupuncture practice to further understand the implications of its development and possible future direction.Hermeneutic methodology was used because it facilitates the exploration between that which is familiar and that which is unfamiliar. Seven New Zealand physiotherapists qualified to practise Western acupuncture were interviewed about their practice experiences. The data in relation to the phenomenon of inquiry was analysed thematically.The findings revealed a complex array of tensions within physiotherapy because of the differences Western acupuncture brings to physiotherapists' practice. Western acupuncture is a new and useful tool in the physiotherapists 'toolbox'. It is congruent with other physiotherapy practices in that it shares the same scientific neurophysiological foundation. However, the association of Western acupuncture with traditional Chinese acupuncture causes it to be viewed as a complementary medical practice and thus, not completely legitimate as a part of physiotherapy. These tensions are further confounded because the technical rationalist paradigm, upon which physiotherapy is based, values evidence-based practices. The best evidence is perceived to be that gained from the randomised controlled trial. I argue that the randomised controlled trial is poorly suited to the evaluation of complex practices such as Western acupuncture. Such insights also challenge physiotherapy, as a whole, because the available 'evidence' does not acknowledge the complexities of practice involving individual practitioners, their colleagues, the profession, other healthcare professions, patients and the public.The tensions encountered in physiotherapy and Western acupuncture practice have led to a number of recommendations in education, practice, research and legislation. Overall, they suggest a need to develop a more inclusive model of practice development. Western acupuncture is a potentially valuable tool. In order to maximise use of this tool physiotherapy practice understandings need to be extended. This in turn, will assist development of the profession as a whole.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture.</field><field name="subject">Physical therapists - New Zealand.</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ata : a theoretical base for best practice in teaching</field><field name="creator">Forsyth, Huhana</field><field name="description">As a postgraduate student, my interest has been in teaching theory and especially holistic based relational teaching practices. As an educator, I am constantly striving to improve my practice and become the best teacher I can for my students. These factors, combined with my strong desire to bring about change in the education system that will value knowledge and beliefs outside the paradigm of the dominant pedagogy, have led to this research.The philosophy of Ata is firmly posited within Matauranga Maori and is not new, however, as a philosophy of teaching theory it is new and is the topic of this thesis. A case study was undertaken to observe the researcher's teaching practice based on the principles of the philosophy, and to consider the possibility of developing a theory of best practice in teaching based on the philosophy of Ata. This was a mixed method study involving the July 2005 intake of Bachelor of Education students for the Matauranga Maori class at the School of Education Te Kura Matauranga, AUT. Data collection methods included research assistant observations, a researcher reflective journal, student questionnaires and a student focus group interview.The findings of the study indicated that teaching under the principles of the philosophy of Ata assists the development of respectful relationships within the classroom environment, and suggests this enhances student learning. The findings could be significant for all teachers and teacher educators as they suggest a teaching theory based on the philosophy of Ata may provide educators with a values based theory of practice that is not only humanistic but also maintains standards of professionalism.From both the literature reviewed and from student comments, indications are that by developing a sense of belonging, a feeling of connectedness, and by demonstrating mutual respect in classroom situations, the learning environment appears to be enhanced. The findings of the study further indicate that the positive effects of teaching under the philosophy of Ata may not be restricted to any particular classroom environment. This is an important finding in my opinion because it indicates that Ata as a teaching philosophy may be successful in growing relationships in other environments, making it a strong, working theory of teaching. Teacher qualities identified by the students as being essential to learning can be developed through embracing the philosophy of Ata and incorporating it into teaching practice and this is the challenge I put forward to all teachers and teacher educators.The study has potentially opened new and exciting possibilities for teacher educators searching for a teaching practice theory that is strongly values-based. Implications of the study include stronger recognition of the value of cultural knowledge in theeducation system, an acknowledgement of the depth of knowledge contained in te ao Maori, and an opportunity to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by developing a bi-cultural model of teaching based on the philosophy of Ata.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teachers, Training of</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/22</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some Samoans' perceptions, values and beliefs on the role of parents and children within the context of aiga/family and the influence of fa'asamoa and the church on Samoan parenting</field><field name="creator">Cowley-Malcolm, Esther Tumama</field><field name="description">This qualitative study describes maternal and paternal experiences of thirty-five Samoans living in Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand. The study was conducted in order to establish, "What, if any changes to parenting practices have occurred since their family migrated into New Zealand?Through interviews, respondents discussed their values, attitudes and beliefs and how they perceived that they were brought up by their own parents. They also described and discussed their own roles as parents and the roles of their children. They also discussed how the church influenced the ways in which their parents parented them and the way they themselves parent their children. Respondents were chosen via a snowball technique of referrals from four different church ministers. The four churches were selected on the recommendation of one Samoan Church Minister as being representative of the Samoan community. Four ministers were interviewed, along with four elders and five parents from each church. Seven other people from outside these churches, four not church attenders were also interviewed in order to be able to further explore the importance and effects of the churches. The theoretical approach engaged a combination of the principles of Grounded Theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) and the 'Fa'afaletui,' (Tamasese, 1997.) The latter is a Samoan framework which gives a multi-layered approach to data interpretation using a range of lenses and perspectives. In conducting this investigation, the combination of Western and Samoan frameworks was appropriate especially given the cultural sensitivities that were apparent around the topic matter and the ethnicity of the respondents and the researcher. Earlier findings, concerning discipline by (Fairbairn-Dunlop, 2002) were affirmed, as were findings about fa'alavelave from the earlier study into parenting practices (McCallum et al, 2000). In this present study, it was found that enculturation (i.e changes in culture) over time, modified parenting practices and specifically that inter-generational perspectives about parenting practices were apparent. Evidence of conflicting approaches to values between generations was encountered and a range of rituals were adapted as a consequence of migration and time; discipline and fa'alavelave were prime examples of this. The relative paucity of a body of Pasifika literature and Pacific research by Pacific people, from which a theoretical foundation for a study of this kind could be developed, was seen to be problematic. It is concluded that enculturation following migration spawns a reconstruction of values and associated practices in parenting and that previously held core values concerning discipline, the church and the family become altered over time and generations. It is also suggested that future research should seek to corroborate the findings of this study by examining the parenting practices of the next generation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parent and child - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Parenting - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Children, Samoan - Care</field><field name="subject">Samoans -  Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Samoans -  Religion</field><field name="subject">Social Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/25</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The waiting room: an art investigation of site in abeyance</field><field name="creator">Vickers, Sharon</field><field name="description">This art project explores issues of unoccupied space.

An in-depth analysis of the phenomenon was completed, with the aim of evoking insights and developing understandings about the lived return-to-work experience. As this research was situated within the critical paradigm, the process of seeking, securing and sustaining employment was viewed in terms of power relationships, and through the multiple positionings of psychiatric disability, employment status and social capital.An unstructured interview process was used to explore the return-to-work experiences of eight purposefully selected informants with a history of mental illness and prior illness-related offending. They were living in the community and had returned to part or full-time employment, which they had sustained for at least six months. The gathered data was interpreted using hermeneutic analysis. This process revealed a number of themes, which were clustered into related groups, under eleven essential overarching themes. Freire's (1972) critical social theory was used to add critical depth to the findings.The findings reveal that returning to work exposes people who are affected by mental illness to an array of challenges and personal opportunities. People who have a forensic psychiatric history can encounter complex employment barriers related to stigma and misunderstanding. Therefore, the selected critical hermeneutic design provided a congruent framework with which to view the informants' quest to seek, secure and sustain employment. Despite significant obstacles, securing employment provides opportunities for individuals to test their skills while engaged in meaningful work activity. The acquisition of work skills can result in individuals' experiencing a strong sense of self-satisfaction. The experience of being bolstered by personal accomplishment often co-exists with, but is not necessarily negated by, difficulties that arise on-the-job.As there is scant reference to forensic rehabilitation within the mental health vocational literature, this study may be a timely contribution. It may also be used to add depth to the knowledge base within the field of mental health rehabilitation, in particular the specialised areas of forensic rehabilitation and vocational practise. Therefore, it may be a positive precursor to further discussion and analysis regarding work and education outcomes from the unique forensic psychiatric perspective.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutic analysis</field><field name="subject">Unstructured interviews</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Return to work</field><field name="subject">Work skills</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of whole body vibration on knee extensor stiffness and functional performance</field><field name="creator">Owen, Gregory J</field><field name="description">The use of vibration as an exercise intervention offers new possibilities for coaches, clinicians, and strength and conditioning practitioners. It appears that muscle activation by means of vibration may induce improvements in strength and power similar to those observed with conventional strength training. Furthermore, vibration is thought to affect the neuromuscular functions that regulate muscle stiffness. There has been preponderance in the literature to assume that the stiffness properties of the muscle affect muscle function, which in turn affects functional performance. Improving functional performance is a major goal for recreational to elite athletes. However, improving the performance of well-trained athletes, especially whilst engaged in in-season training, is challenging, as the training status of such athletes is near optimal. Furthermore, training and playing schedules usually do not allow for adequate training frequencies. Therefore, the application of in-season vibration training may offer a means by which substantial loading can be placed upon the athlete with minimal interference to the weekly schedule. Consequently, the aims of this thesis were to: 1) determine the reliability of a new method to measure the stiffness of the knee extensor muscles; 2) investigate the relationship between knee extensor stiffness, strength, power, and speed; and 3) examine the effect six weeks of squat training with and without whole body vibration (WBV) has on knee extensor stiffness, strength, power, and speed.The reliability of a new method to measure the stiffness of the knee extensors was assessed. The within trial variation (coefficient of variation [CV] - 5.41-7.45%) for all five loads (30, 40, 50, 60, and 70% one-repetition-maximum [1RM]) and test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients [ICC] - 0.92-0.96) were deemed acceptable. Thirty semi-elite male rugby union players were assessed on sprint speed, squat strength, countermovement-jump (CMJ), and drop-jump (DJ) performance to investigate their relationships to knee extensor stiffness. Knee extensor stiffness was found to have no significant relationship to any of the functional performance measures (r = -0.16-0.17). On the basis of these findings it was suggested that the relationship of the knee extensor stiffness to functional performance was not significant (P&gt;0.05). It was suggested that either the postural requirements of the test were inappropriate, or the knee extensor muscles were not the most suitable muscle group to measure.Immediately after the testing session described above, subjects began a six-week intervention of squat training with or without WBV. The percentage change over the six-week intervention for the stiffness and performance data were calculated and compared to determine if differences between training interventions were significant (P&lt;0.05). The mean percentage change in knee extensor stiffness (average load of 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70% 1RM) for the squat only and squat vibration group were -4.18% and -6.59%, respectively. Non-significant mean percentage changes in squat strength (1.32 and -0.50%), CMJ height (-7.92 and -1.47%), DJ reactivity co-efficient (1.25 and -3.54%), and sprint times over 5, 10, and 20 m (range = -0.86 to -1.16% and 0.54 to -1.88%) were observed for the squat only and squat vibration groups, respectively. Squat training with and without WBV was capable of maintaining, but not improving knee extensor stiffness, strength, power, and speed during a six-week in-season training cycle.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/31</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to do, learning to be: the transition to competence in critical care nursing</field><field name="creator">Fielding, Sandra</field><field name="description">Making the transition to an area of specialist nursing practice is challenging for both the learner and staff who are responsible for education and skill development. This study uses grounded theory methodology to explore the question: "How do nurses learn critical care nursing?"The eight registered nurses who participated in this study were recruited from a range of intensive care settings. The criteria for inclusion in the study included the participant having attained competency within the critical care setting. Data was collected from individual interviews. The findings of this study developed during the coding and comparative analysis process, and subsequently theoretical sampling was used to further explore the identified concepts.This study found that nurses' focus on two main areas during their orientation and induction into critical care nursing practice. These are learning to do (skill acquisition) and learning to be (professional socialisation). The process of transition involves two stages: that of learning to do the tasks related to critical care nursing practice, and the ongoing development of competence and confidence in practice ability. The relationship of the learner with the critical care team is a vital part of the transition to competency within the specialist area.This study identifies factors that influence the learner during transition and also provides an understanding of the strategies used by the learners to attain competency. These findings are applicable to educators and leaders responsible for the education and ongoing learning of nurses within critical care practice. The use of strategies such as simulated learning and repetition are significant in skill acquisition. However attention must also be paid to issues which influence the professional socialisation process, such as the quality of preceptor input during orientation and the use of ongoing mentoring of the learner.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intensive care nursing</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/34</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Me mau kia ita ki te tuakiri o te whanau / Whanau identity and whanau development are Interdependent</field><field name="creator">Penetito, Kim Himoana</field><field name="description">Whanau is often qualified as synonymous to the description family, or extended family. The purpose of this study is to show that whanau is not only a social grouping belonging to Maori society, but an aspect of cultural identity central to the future development of Maori. Whanau is a concept belonging to Te Ao Maori, and the development of this concept has been challenged through the history of Aotearoa by external cultural influences and internal responses to these influences. These influences include Western paradigms and societal norms introduced through colonisation and leading to the modern perception that whanau is a mirror image of the concept of family.Modernisation, as an example of a Western developmental theory is applied in this study to demonstrate the impact of an ethnocentric notion on the concept and experience of whanau - culturally, socially, economically and spiritually. It is observed by the writer that whanau remains central to strategies for development as a people notwithstanding this experience. This observation required that the study explore the key elements retained by whanau, for the concept of whanau to have achieved sustainability. Although the effects of external influences have impacted on the structural, functional and relational aspects of wh&#257;nau, it is evident in the findings from this study conducted with descendents of Ngati Te Oro that the practice of whanau as a cultural grouping was significant to retaining a cultural identity. This finding has strengthened the position that there are specific contributing aspects towards a secure whanau identity that provides the foundations as well as the vehicle to progress the development of Maori.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Family relationships</field><field name="subject">Kinship</field><field name="subject">Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Whanau</field><field name="subject">Kupu</field><field name="subject">Maori Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mode of entry observations for environmental based INVs (International New Ventures)</field><field name="creator">Hogg, David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the risk and internationalisation practices of International New Ventures (INVs) in the environmental sector. The purpose of the research is to make observations regarding the manner in which environmental INVs manage risk when internationalising.The literature review focuses upon the published literature that relates to INVs, risk and risk management, mode of entry and the environmental sector. Section one of the literature review provides the characteristics of what constitutes an INV. Section 2 provides a review of the risk literature, this allows the differences between Multi National Enterprise (MNE) and INV risk and risk management to be reviewed. Section 3 takes the international business risks mentioned in section 2 and relates them to the mode of entry literature (i.e. the internationalisation of firms). The final section of the literature review is used to justify the investigation into the water pollution and control sector of the environmental industry. The research question is 'What strategies do environmental INVs use when entering new international markets?' The research question is broken into five specific research questions and addressed using the Repertory Grid process. The Repertory Grid process is used as it can turn the tacit knowledge held by the participants into explicit knowledge. The results show areas of convergence and divergence between practice and academia. The results also suggest new issues that need to be considered when firms internationalise.

The literature indicates that modern consumers are sophisticated, discerning and are less loyal to a particular brand than they used to be. Consumers today are more concerned with buying a product that not only meets their needs but also provides them with pleasurable experiences. There are many ways to explain buyer behaviour; however for this thesis storytelling, dream theory, and "Lovemarks" have been used to examine the usefulness of the selected theories to the visual communication design industry. The research has focussed on an homogeneous product (bottled water) as a vehicle to establish whether all the plans and strategies in recently published literature can be trusted and be used for design strategies for planning a marketing campaign. The reason for doing this is to establish some new knowledge that could contribute to the design industry in terms of criteria for branding, marketing and design strategy in visual communication design. An extensive secondary research of the literature has been made to inform this study. Primary information has also been gathered by using carefully designed and comprehensive materials involving professional interviews, and a major case study of bottled water has been conducted, which includes a field study, focus groups and surveys. Information and raw data generated by the research have been analysed either quantitatively or qualitatively. The result generated by this study is not conclusive, however, pointing to the fact that the buying behaviour of consumers is complex and variable.

Leadership is still mysterious and complex. This study is a journey of discovery designed to explore the complexities and prominence of leadership as it exists in New Zealand. The journey began with a literature review metaphorically represented as three poles of knowledge. The first pole focused on M&#257;ori (ordinary, of this land, native people of New Zealand) and M&#257;ori culture where leadership is highly valued. The second explored sport and in particular rugby, which enjoys celebrity status amongst M&#257;ori and New Zealanders. The final pole reviewed organisational studies and literature on leadership.The study pursued perceptions of male M&#257;ori rugby players concerning leadership, from a M&#257;ori, rugby, and New Zealand perspective. The research approach employed by this study is based on the principles of grounded theory, kaupapa M&#257;ori methodology and its Western cousin, ethnomethodology. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with nine prominent past and present M&#257;ori rugby players. By focusing on this demographic, this study was able to examine M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; leadership styles, similarities and differences; highlight key cultural characteristics and strengthen arguments claiming a relationship exists between the three poles of knowledge. This approach enabled a review of those beneficial and advantageous qualities considered to have an impact on leadership in New Zealand.Findings from interviews revealed relationships do exist between the three poles of knowledge. The values or concepts wh&#257;nau (family, extended family), responsibility, collectivism, and tu&#257;kana/t&#275;ina (elder/leaders to younger/novices) relationships were identified as central qualities of M&#257;ori leadership. Collectivism is expressed as concerns of wh&#257;nau. Reciprocity was embodied in relationships of tu&#257;kana/t&#275;ina with rugby being a vehicle that enhanced both and encouraged leadership development. Findings combined with evidence from literature prompted discussion aimed at three different audiences: leadership theorists; M&#257;ori, and; rugby audiences.

Yet the work is not shaped by the hand of a conservator destined to abandon the imagination in favour of a trail of physical evidence. Nor does it reflect the conventional rationalist sensibilities of a museum worker who, by suppressing a poetic understanding of the world is confined by "cold language" (Frame 1992 p.45) and remains caught inextricably in the web of colonial thinking.Here the imagination is truth (Einzig 1996) and an understanding of the nature of this inner space the key to the locked door.

Compelled as much by a love of the museum profession as a crisis of European consciousness (Spivak in Harasym 1990), objects are assembled for an inner journey to a place where shadow and sunlight chase each other across the landscape (McQueen 2000). This is the dialectic space of both curator and artist, of the rational and the irrational, of inside and outside, and of disciplinary devotion and betrayal.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art exhibition</field><field name="subject">Space</field><field name="subject">Artist</field><field name="subject">Curator</field><field name="subject">Museum</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Commitment-based human resource management and organisational performance : an empirical study of small businesses in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yuan</field><field name="description">Human resource management involves a set of activities that involve employees within organisations. The development of the concept of strategic human resource management requires systematic examination and an informed perspective. High commitment human resource systems aim to enhance employee commitment within organisations. High commitment human resource systems have close relationships to organisational performance. Management must therefore understand the ways in which organisational performance can relate to high commitment human resource systems in order to achieve a competitive advantage in today's intensively competitive marketplace.Small businesses are important players in various economies; therefore, understanding how high commitment human resource systems relate to organisational performance in small businesses would be valuable. Despite the considerable benefit associated with knowledge of the relationship between high commitment human resource systems and organisational performance in small businesses, this area has not been specifically researched. This study empirically addresses these topical issues by asking:Are high commitment human resource systems related to organisational performance in New Zealand small businesses?In order to answer this question, this study develops a set of research propositions. A respondent group of small businesses completed a questionnaire designed to gather information regarding the relationship between high commitment human resource systems and organisational performance in small businesses. Statistical analysis of the data identified a number of interesting findings.The results indicate that small businesses conduct high commitment human resource systems with compliance and commitment human resource practices. Small businesses use compliance human resource practices much more widely than commitment human resource practices. The results of this study provide evidence that commitment human resource practices do exist in the context of small businesses; however, commitment human resource practices are unique to the context of small businesses, differing from those in larger organisations. This study also suggests that commitment human resource practices in small businesses do not relate to organisational performance with regard to employee turnover or financial performance as they do in larger organisations. This study emphasises the importance of an understanding of how high commitment human resource systems relate to organisational performance in the context of small businesses. The study also discusses implications for research areas and business practice, the limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/47</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The journey towards employment for Chinese early childhood student teachers: a case study</field><field name="creator">Heald, Denise J</field><field name="description">The topic of this thesis stems from my interest in finding out whether a partial early childhood Certificate qualification could procure employment in early childhood centres for Chinese student teachers, which could then eventuate in Permanent Residency status. Employment in early childhood centres is currently being driven by the need to comply with Ministry of Education requirements which state that centres need to have fifty per cent of their teachers fully qualified and registered by 2007. The literature surrounding the employment experiences of Asian immigrants to New Zealand reveals negative outcomes, and discrimination is cited as one of the causes of this. However, early childhood education in New Zealand espouses a strong philosophy of cultural diversity and inclusive practice.The employment experiences of seven Chinese early childhood student teachers are documented in this thesis using a qualitative mixed-method approach involving Case Study as the overarching methodology/method, supplemented with Narrative Inquiry and Documentary Analyses to collect and analyse the data.The main findings of my research were: there are obstacles that this ethnic group faced in gaining employment relevant to their qualification - this was a negative, but not unexpected outcome. The second major finding was that, despite the over-arching philosophy of early childhood education in Aotearoa/New Zealand, I found that there were several areas where the participants of this study were vulnerable to 'discrimination'. This was predominantly in the form of unfair practices and included: interview experiences; relief teaching; employment contracts; and payment issues. The participants of this study were also vulnerable in other ways. In order to enrol in further study to become fully qualified, they need to achieve a high IELTS (International English Language Testing System) level.A third and much more positive outcome was that participants who found employment did so through practicum placements, networks of friends, and with those centres that were accepting of 'cultural difference'. All of these findings were to some extent largely congruent with the literature on immigration experiences of 'migrants'.Further research needs to be undertaken on this topic by myself, and others in this field, in particular, how International Students are 'protected' in Aotearoa/New Zealand. I found that there was a 'loophole' in the Immigration Points Table and that International Students are possibly being encouraged to enrol in Early Childhood Certificate programmes in the belief that they will find employment and eventually Permanent Residency status. This research shows that this is not always the case.In addition to this, further research needs to focus on the views of centre owners and staff, with regard to employing Chinese early childhood educators; the views of Chinese parents with regard to their perspective of Chinese teachers and lastly, in the area of relief teaching. In the conclusion several recommendations for changes to policy and practice at the tertiary level are raised.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early childhood teachers</field><field name="subject">Asian teachers</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Culturally competent care</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">Immigrants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/52</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental techniques to determine the Young's Modulus of the trachea</field><field name="creator">Hermawan, Vera</field><field name="description">In addition to its usefulness in modeling and simulation processes, the modulus of elasticity is an index which is highly used in biomedical identifications and tissue characterizations. For many composite and viscoelastic materials an "accurate modulus" is an idealistic hypothesis and an "equivalent modulus" is normally of a high biomechanical significance. The composite shape of the trachea, which consists of the smooth muscles and cartilage rings, renders the fact that an equivalent modulus is in place for many applications. In this paper three in-vitro nondestructive testing techniques are presented to determine the Young modulus of elasticity of the trachea and the results are compared with the standard uniaxial state of stress method. These techniques are based on: (1) simulating the trachea as a pressurized vessel and deducing a special relationship between the pressure and the radial strain; (2) using two hydrophones and studying the variation in acoustic transmittance caused by the presence of the trachea in a water-bath; (3) considering the trachea as a thin cylindrical shell and determining the resonance vibration response. Elaborate discussion is presented to identify the "pros" and "cons" of each technique and final practical recommendations are made.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trachea</field><field name="subject">Elasticity</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/62</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile commerce adoption across the supply chain in businesses in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Al Haj Ali, Eman Ibrahim</field><field name="description">This research investigates the adoption of mobile commerce (MC) technologies across the supply chain in three businesses in New Zealand that already have adopted and implemented MC. The research used the technological innovation literature and the supply chain research to develop a framework that could assist this research in its attempt to understand the EC phenomenon in the three cases. This research followed the multiple case studies design. The findings from the three case studies suggested that most of the MC applications were concentrated in the B2B side of the SC relationships. Most of the MC activities were internally focused in order to streamline internal mobile operations and processes inside the studied businesses. The clients of the interviewed businesses in this research were not involved in the different MC activities. MC in businesses in New Zealand was used to drive efficiencies in operations in order to fulfil both orders and field requests (coordination and scheduling) leading ultimately to increased customer satisfaction. This research found that MC adoption in the businesses in New Zealand was motivated by its advantages, top management support, the availability of internal IT experts and expertise, the suitability of the MC in filling a mobile gap (i.e., company's field-force), competition, support from technology vendors in assisting and facilitating the adoption decision. The adoption of MC was hindered by its incompatibility with the business environment and the complexity of the MC technology. However, cost, pressure from buyers and suppliers and vertical linkages were unimportant as such to the adoption decision. The research highlight implications concerning MC research in businesses in New Zealand and suggest areas for further research in this innovative technology (MC). These initial insights are of great interest to businesses, researchers, and professionals interested in the adoption of MC in businesses in New Zealand and elsewhere. However, this research raise the importance of conducting more work to further assess the depth of the MC phenomenon in New Zealand and more time is needed before judging MC penetration and success in businesses in New Zealand.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile commerce - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Business logistics - Information technology - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/65</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of a successful key account management programme- a New Zealand perspective</field><field name="creator">Yu, Mandy Ning-Ya</field><field name="description">Cultivating profitable, long-lasting customer-supplier partnerships is a significant task for today's companies. These relationships bring value-adding benefits, including cost and risk reductions, and bring joint business opportunities (Ravald &amp; Gr&#246;nroos, 1996; McDonald, et al. 1997). Key account management deals with developing customersupplier partnerships within the business-to-business context. Key account managers are responsible for delivering customised products/services, and defining possible business opportunities for both parties, after carefully selecting buying companies according to their strategic importance for the supplier. However, key account management may be complicated for suppliers to manage especially if the selling companies do not know how to implement a key account management programme appropriately. There have been a number of studies attempting to identify approaches to successful key account management programmes (Millman &amp; Wilson, 1995, Napolitano, 1997, Homburg et al., 2002). Abratt &amp; Kelly (2002) were the first to investigate both buyers' and sellers' perceptions of success factors of a key account management programme. They found that both buyers and sellers hold similar points of view on what a successful key account management programme should contain.This thesis is a replication of Abratt &amp; Kelly (2002), which refined their scale to obtain better reliability assessments and generalisability. Only some of the findings of the original study could be replicated. Six factors were extracted while only three of them were reliable. Some of the items loaded onto the same dimension in the replication as Abratt &amp; Kelly (2002), whereas others did not. The discussion section of the thesis suggests reasons for the difference in findings and suggests future research areas based on this discussion.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Key account management, industrial marketing, selling, relationship marketing, customer - supplier partnership</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/66</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate of vitamin C in commercial fruit juices</field><field name="creator">Nagra, Surinder</field><field name="description">Vitamin C occurs in relatively high concentrations in fresh and processed fruits and vegetables but is found to a lesser extent in animal tissues and animal-derived products. Nearly 90 % of vitamin C in the human diet is obtained from fruits and vegetables but this can be indirect by way of commercially prepared fruit juices. These juices are often enriched with vitamin C which has been synthetically prepared. There is a wide range of such juices on the New Zealand market, and they are a significant source of dietary vitamin C for many in the population. The focus of this research is on the Keri range of juice products.The present study monitors the fate of vitamin C during storage of Keri juices up to the best-before date, and under a range of other storage and consumption situations. Two methods were adopted for determining ascorbic acid (AA, the chemical identity of vitamin C). These were the titrimetric method, which is based upon the reduction of the dye 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol by AA in acidic solution, and liquid chromatography, which is used to separate AA from its immediate oxidation product dehydroascorbic acid. In the latter method these two analytes can be measured independently. The liquid chromatography was less successful than the simpler titrimetric method, so most of the work was done by titration. However, the concentration of dehydroascorbic acid, which has vitamin C activity in vivo, remained uncertain. Moreover, the titrimetric method could not be applied to juices with high purple anthocyanin concentrations, like blackcurrant, because the colour change at the titration end point could not be detected. pH adjustment to change colour was ineffective, and decolourisation with charcoal led to the rapid and complete destruction of AA. The concentration of AA in Keri juices at the time of manufacture were always much higher than claimed on the labels. Storage for up to nine months at room temperature resulted in a loss in AA of between 37 and 68 %, depending on the juice and exposure to fluorescent light. However, the time of storage was a much more dominant factor than light exposure. The kinetics of loss, straight lines, were most easily explained by an aerobic model of AA degradation from oxygen diffusing across the polyethylene tetraphthalate bottle wall. Overall, the label claims made were defensible in terms of the best-before date, because it took at least 100 days of storage before the AA concentration in the most susceptible juices fell below the claimed value. This is because these drinks are fast moving consumer goods and storage beyond 100 days is unlikely. (Nonetheless, the supplier (Keri Juice Company) has since adopted its new unitised method of formulating juice. This has resulted in an initially higher concentration of vitamin C as compared to the juices under investigation.) In the nine months storage experiment there was some evidence for the presence of dehydroascorbic acid in blackcurrant drinks, but not in another three juices. Pasteurisation during preparation of these drinks resulted in up to 7 % loss of AA, probably due to oxygen dissolved in water, and accelerated by heat of pasteurisation. Higher temperatures in later storage also accelerated losses. Progressive exposure of juice to air during simulated consumption of 3 L bottles over a week also accelerated losses. Finally, exposure to sunlight in a diurnal temperature environment accelerated losses five-fold higher than in total darkness. Filtration of ultraviolet light approximately halved the loss due to sunlight. Overall however, it can be concluded that AA in the Keri range of juices is very resistant to degradation of AA.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commercially prepared fruit juice</field><field name="subject">Titration</field><field name="subject">Liquid chromatography</field><field name="subject">Vitamin C loss</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/67</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene selection based on consistency modelling, algorithms and applications</field><field name="creator">Hu, Yingjie (Raphael)</field><field name="description">Consistency modeling for gene selection is a new topic emerging from recent cancer bioinformatics research. The result of classification or clustering on a training set was often found very different from the same operations on a testing set. Here, the issue is addressed as a consistency problem. In practice, the inconsistency of microarray datasets prevents many typical gene selection methods working properly for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In an attempt to deal with this problem, a new concept of performance-based consistency is proposed in this thesis.An interesting finding in our previous experiments is that by using a proper set of informative genes, we significantly improved the consistency characteristic of microarray data. Therefore, how to select genes in terms of consistency modelling becomes an interesting topic. Many previously published gene selection methods perform well in the cancer diagnosis domain, but questions are raised because of the irreproducibility of experimental results. Motivated by this, two new gene selection methods based on the proposed performance-based consistency concept, GAGSc (Genetic Algorithm Gene Selection method in terms of consistency) and LOOLSc (Leave-one-out Least-Square bound method with consistency measurement) were developed in this study with the purpose of identifying a set of informative genes for achieving replicable results of microarray data analysis.The proposed consistency concept was investigated on eight benchmark microarray and proteomic datasets. The experimental results show that the different microarray datasets have different consistency characteristics, and that better consistency can lead to an unbiased and reproducible outcome with good disease prediction accuracy.As an implementation of the proposed performance-based consistency, GAGSc and LOOLSc are capable of providing a small set of informative genes. Comparing with those traditional gene selection methods without using consistency measurement, GAGSc and LOOLSc can provide more accurate classification results. More importantly, GAGSc and LOOLSc have demonstrated that gene selection, with the proposed consistency measurement, is able to enhance the reproducibility in microarray diagnosis experiments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gene selection</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Bias</field><field name="subject">Reproducability</field><field name="subject">Cancer bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">DNA microarrays</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/69</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of consumer knowledge in consumer evaluations of brand extension</field><field name="creator">Ma, Yun</field><field name="description">This study examines the effects of two types of consumer knowledge, product and brand knowledge, on consumer fit perceptions between an extension and its parent brand, so as to further investigate the role of consumer knowledge in brand extension evaluations. Based on the reviewed literature four hypotheses were proposed. The first two hypotheses predicted that both product and brand knowledge has an impact of consumer perceived fit between an extension and its parent brand. The other two hypotheses proposed that product knowledge affect more on the fit perceptions between a functional brand and its extension, while brand knowledge affect more on the fit perceptions between a prestige brand and its extension. An experiment was performed to examine these hypothesized relationships. Two hypotheses related to brand knowledge are supported, while the other two hypotheses related to product knowledge are not supported statistically. The results reveal that product and brand knowledge have different effects on consumer fit perceptions between an extension and its parent brand in terms of different brand types, functional vs. prestige brand.

The literature review indicates that intangible resources are more likely to be sources of SCA because they are invisible and difficult to copy. In addition, brand image and brand reputation are recognised as two of the most important intangible resources. However, the relationship between brand image, brand reputation and SCA has not been sufficiently explored. A comparative case study of three leading sports apparel brands Adidas, Puma and Canterbury Clothing Company was conducted. Data were collected supporting a triangulation collection method of secondary data sources as well as interviews with a senior manager from each of the brands and two focus groups conducted with consumers. Data analysis involved a six-step coding process, also known as thematic analysis. Subsequent analysis identified three elements that influence both brand image and brand reputation. Sponsorship, product quality and media were found to influence how consumers perceive a firm's brand image, and over time this brand image is believed to create a brand reputation. Furthermore, findings suggest that brand image will potentially lead toward a competitive advantage (CA) and brand reputation can potentially lead towards a SCA. These elements are underpinned by eight propositions and are presented in a proposed model.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/76</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lightness, sustainability, design: framing product design</field><field name="creator">Boult, Martin</field><field name="description">To design anything with lightness in mind is perhaps a contradiction in itself. To impose upon the designer such a factor from the outset of a brief surely creates a burden or limitation in the consideration of materials and form. However, the focus of this research project is to examine and apply lightness in a range of contexts or conditions. The aim is to explore the singularity of each condition; then to discuss the paradox and contradictions that are often present in new products that continue to predominate with a duplicitous emphasis on aesthetics and form. For the purpose of exploration of lightness, a series of products will be created to expose the paradox that exists in deploying a strategy such as lightness in singularity, without considering broader implication of product design on the environment, economy and society. These 3D outputs comprise the practice based component of this research, the balance to be a written exegesis. The genuine crisis of sustainable design is the need to design to construct a point of view on design - a paradoxically futile position that is directly linked to the challenge of engaging in true sustainable product design practice. This paradox will be investigated through a range of Sustainable Product Design strategies, examining the irony that exists in producing more goods and services to solve the problems of a world already oversupplied with the 'stuff' of humankind.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Light</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Paradox</field><field name="subject">Society</field><field name="subject">Sustainable</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Product</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/80</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the meaning of supervision for mental health support workers? A critical hermeneutic inquiry</field><field name="creator">Sutcliffe, Robin</field><field name="description">Supervision is a process employed by health professions with the general aim of resourcing and educating workers and protecting clients. The purpose of this study was to uncover the meaning of supervision for mental health support workers (MHSW) in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Mental health support work is a non-clinical role, the aim of which is to support people who are or have been experiencing mental illness or disability. It is based on a philosophy of 'recovery' which aims to empower mental health service users and enhance their sense of personal agency. Four people employed as MHSW were interviewed both individually and in groups about their experiences of receiving supervision. Transcripts of the interviews were interpreted using a critical hermeneutic methodology.Critical hermeneutics is informed by critical social theory and is concerned with uncovering the implicit and explicit power dynamics embedded within social relationships and structures. Critical social theory proposes that reality is socially constructed and that this construction occurs through dialogue. That notion is incorporated into this study by considering the impact of the inquiry on the participants and the researcher and the contribution to the evolving traditions of MHSW and supervision of MHSW.The participants of this study all value effective supervision as a process that supports them while they support their clients. A relationship based on trust, reciprocity and mutual respect and which is held within clear and overt boundaries is experienced as supportive and enhances the quality of engagement. A supportive supervisory relationship impacted favourably on other supervisory functions such as skill development. Effective supervision was also found to contribute to personal, cultural and professional identity and to be empowering for MHSW.The study concludes that supervision is a dynamic process that all of those who participate in whether as service user, support worker, supervisor, manager or other stakeholder, are contributing to. It proposes that as MHSW occurs within a new paradigm the supervision of support workers must also be located in this paradigm. A definition of supervision in this paradigm is alluded to in the words of one of the participants of this study, "supervision is far more than supervision."</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An improved media access control protocol for wireless LANs</field><field name="creator">Lian, Jason Hailin</field><field name="description">Media access control (MAC) protocols play a vital role in determining the performance of wireless local area networks (WLANs). While a variety of MAC protocols have been proposed recently for wireless LANs, the problem of efficient bandwidth utilization, higher throughput, lower mean delay, and fairness has not been fully solved yet. For example, IEEE 802.11 protocol does not perform well and the bandwidth utilization drops below 50% of the total bandwidth under heavy traffic load conditions.Therefore, in order to address these problems of WLANs under heavy traffic load, this thesis proposes a new scheme named Buffer MAC. We analyze the performance of Buffer MAC by using a number of simulation experiments based on ns-2 network simulator. Results show that the proposed Buffer MAC protocol not only improves bandwidth utilization of WLANs but also improves average packet delay, throughput and fairness performance under heavy traffic load conditions.This thesis also contains an exhaustive and comparative study of the new MAC protocol and the original IEEE 802.11 protocol.

It has been identified that cavity filling and solidification process are two most critical aspects to produce premium quality casting components.During the solidification process of casting alloy, it is a well known phenomenon that metal experiences volumetric shrinkage due to its density difference between liquid and solid phase. When this volumetric shrinkage is not properly compensated, then a casting defect commonly known as solidification shrinkage occurs. The solidification shrinkage has very detrimental effects on structural integrity required for premium quality casting such as aluminium alloy wheels.Literature and practical experiences of foundry men show that it is critical to achieve unidirectional solidification pattern by avoiding an isolated hot spot in order to minimise the solidification shrinkage. However, it is found that the geometry of industrial casting applications is often constrained by other design factors that would not naturally avoid these isolated hot spots. The subject of this research, aluminium alloy wheels, is not excluded from this constraint.In aluminium alloy wheels, an isolated hot spot is commonly observed in an area known as rim and spoke junction due to its geometry constraints. Consequently, the solidification shrinkage is commonly experienced, which is undesirable due to its detrimental effects for the structural integrity of alloy wheels. In order to minimise the solidification shrinkage, forced cooling method is applied to avoid an isolated hot spot. The control of this forced cooling is achieved by cooling media, flow rate of cooling media and duration cooling circuit. Foundry experiments in industrial environment were conducted producing aluminium alloy wheels using commercially treated A356 (Al-Si) alloy, where different durations of cooling circuit were used to understand the sensitivity of solidification shrinkage formation to the duration of cooling circuit. This was followed by metallurgical structure analysis and numerical modelling to suggest the sensitivity of cooling circuit duration in controlling solidification shrinkage.The major finding conclusion of this research is that control of the shrinkage formation is not very sensitive to the duration cooling circuit. It is suggested that as casting solidifies initially from the mould wall, it retracts away from the cast-mould interface due to thermal contraction. Consequently, air gap is formed between casting and mould interface, creating an effective thermal resistance layer. Thereafter, heat transfer across the cast-mould interface is not sensitive to the change in the cooling channel which is a distance to the cast-mould interface.Some limitations of numerical modelling and metallurgical analysis were also identified during this research and recommendations were made to improve the accuracy of local hot spot prediction in production of aluminium alloy wheels. More specifically, numerical modelling of the effect of grain refinement and use of non homogeneous material property (particularly fraction of solid) for rapidly chilled area. Fraction of eutectic rather than secondary dendrites arm spacing is a proper microstructure parameter that can be used to locate the hot spot.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automotive components</field><field name="subject">Alloy casting</field><field name="subject">Solidification shrinkage</field><field name="subject">Geometrical constraints</field><field name="subject">Hot spot prediction</field><field name="subject">Cooling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/95</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of mobile internet deployment models in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Huang, Raymond</field><field name="description">Internet services play an increasingly important role in modern society.

Altitude can be simulated through use of apartments, tents and masks that allow athletes to breathe air containing less oxygen. There is clear evidence that altitude exposure combined with sea-level training enhances endurance performance especially when the altitude is real. It is unclear what the optimum level of altitude and length of exposure is to enhance performance, although researchers generally adopt 3-4 weeks at moderate altitude (~3000m). There is also little evidence to suggest how long the performance effect persists for. Large gains in VO2max have been reported following actual altitude exposure that may be partly mediated via an increase in red cell volume or haemoglobin mass. However, exposure to simulated altitude appears to have a little effect on VO2max probably due to differences in daily exposure time. The effects of altitude exposure on sprint performance are limited to several investigations that demonstrate a tendency for improved performance, especially in repeated sprints.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Altitude, Influence of</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Sport Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/99</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on Chinese outbound travel agencies : the case of China-to-New Zealand travel</field><field name="creator">Qu, Ning</field><field name="description">China is rising rapidly as a new major source of outbound tourists in the world. The market potential is enormous. For New Zealand, the visitor numbers will jump to almost 160,000 within the following five years, making China one of New Zealand's biggest markets. Chinese outbound travel agencies play dominate role in operating and organizing international travel in China as outbound travel is highly controlled by the government and outbound agencies are the only group who are authorized to do international travel businesses. Therefore, it is imperative for the New Zealand tourism industry to understand the nature of the Chinese outbound travel agencies and the distribution system as it helps successfully market New Zealand in the Chinese market.This thesis explores the structure of distribution channels linking China and New Zealand and examines the performance of Chinese outbound travel agencies in conducting outbound travel to New Zealand in the Chinese market. The research studies the inter-dependent relationships and partnerships between outbound travel agencies and various channel members. It identifies the functions of channel members from each level in the distribution system and provides behavioural explanations for their distribution decisions. It also discusses the characteristics of the Chinese outbound market and Chinese travel preferences indirectly from tourism suppliers' perspetive aiming at providing a better understanding of the behavioural characteristics of Chinese outbound travel agencies and why the industry functions the way it does in the Chinese market.The research used qualitative research method in order to obtain an in-depth understanding into a wide range of issues in relation to the topic. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted to study the functions and performance of the outbound travel agencies as well as other channel members at every level both at the market and the destination. By examining the entire distribution system across national boundaries, this thesis seeks to expose multiplicities involved in the Chinese outbound travel and provide a systematic and comprehensive study.The research findings show that Chinese outbound travel agencies are the most influential member in the entire distribution system. They act as a bridge linking the Chinese market and the destination. They work with Chinese travel retailers by introducing a variety of international tour products and providing up-to-date information. They are highly dependent on inbound travel agents at the destination in terms of obtaining information and providing ground services. Limited number of outbound travel agencies makes them well positioned along the distribution system and gives them the advantage over other channel members. However, the Chinese outbound travel industry is immature and very price oriented. Due to the lack of destination information, price is considered as the most critical factor to make purchasing decision for both travel industry and the market. This feature was taken advantage by some overseas tour operators since they have been involved in selling below cost tour packages and low value trips. Many countries were facing this problem from the Chinese market. Moreover, New Zealand inbound tour operators were more satisfied with large travel agencies in China since they have reasonably good destination knowledge and better understanding of conducting business while the rest of the market was considered lack of sufficient information about the New Zealand products. Education and training programme are required in the Chinese market in order to improve the image of the destination and increase market share.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism - China</field><field name="subject">Tourism - New Zealand.</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into 5-lobe lung modelling</field><field name="creator">Vuong, Xuan Tung</field><field name="description">To understand how the input impedance of the respiratory system relates to pressure and volume airflow of the airway branched structure, this thesis focuses on developing a mathematical model of the branched airway including trachea and branching airways. The 5-Lobe lung model is developed mathematically and experimentally. A computer model is constructed in the MathlabTM programming environment. It accounts for the effects of airways with varying cross-sectional area, flexible wall properties, and the bronchial tree within the lung using the mathematical methods developed in previous researches. The terminal impedances are determined by proposed idealized lobe models. A range of frequencies up to 256 Hz are tested on this model. Cases of study on obstructions by varying lung stiffness from healthy to unhealthy conditions are investigated.Mathematical model is validated by experiment investigations on the mechanical lung simulator, which is built in Diagnostic &amp; Control Research Centre at Auckland University of Technology. The results conclude that mathematical methods used in this research are capable to produce predictable results of the input impedance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lungs</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A kinematic analysis of acute and longitudinal adaptions to resisted sprinting</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Keir</field><field name="description">The phase of greatest acceleration (0-30 metres) during sprinting is thought to be critical for success in many sporting situations. Methods for improving acceleration phase performance are therefore an important area of study for conditioners and sports scientists. Typically a variety of resistance training techniques are used to improve strength and power of the lower limb musculature that is important to sprinting performance. One such technique is resisted sprinting which involves the use of apparatus such as weighted vests and sleds to provide movement specific overload to athletes. The purpose of this thesis was primarily, to compare sprint times, step variables and joint kinematics when sprinting with a vest loaded at 15% and 20% of the athlete's body mass and towing a sled with 15% and 20% of body mass. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of a six-week training program utilising resisted sprinting on acceleration phase performance in three athletes.In the first study, 20 semi-elite subjects performed five 30-metre sprints: one unloaded sprint, two sled sprints loaded at 15% of their body mass and 20% of their body mass, and two vest sprints with the same loads relative to body mass. Each sprint was videoed in the sagittal plane at five, 15 and 25 metres from the start of the 30-metre sprint and times were recorded at 10 and 30-metres using timing lights. Video data were digitised and the following step variables were calculated: step length, step frequency, stance phase duration and swing phase duration. Stance phase angles of the trunk, thigh, knee and ankle were also calculated. Step length, step frequency and swing phase duration during vest and sled sprinting were found to decrease significantly (P&lt;0.05) when compared to unloaded sprinting values. Stance phase duration during vest and sled sprinting increased compared to unloaded sprinting values (P&lt;0.05). Additionally, sled towing displayed significantly greater (P&lt;0.05) trunk flexion at foot strike and toe-off, and significantly greater (P&lt;0.05) knee flexion at foot strike than both the unloaded and vest sprinting conditions. Sled towing also induced significantly greater thigh extension at toe-off compared to the vest conditions (P&lt;0.05). Thus the addition of load to the athlete via vest sprinting and sled towing may influence performance in different ways, and hence the objective of the athlete should be considered when choosing which of these techniques to use.In the second study, a single subject research design was utilised to assess whether sled towing and vest sprinting resulted in changes in performance over a six-week period of training. In this study, three subjects trained twice a week for six weeks using resisted sprinting. Subjects were randomly assigned to sled training, vest training or combination training (one training session a week with each apparatus). Subjects were tested at baseline, after three weeks of training and after six weeks of training for 10 and 30-metre sprint times and selected step variables (step length, step frequency and stance phase duration). Data analysis involved both visual analysis of graphed data and statistical analysis using the two standard deviation band method. The combination training subject improved performance over both 10 and 30 metres. Step variable data were inconclusive regarding the mechanisms behind these improvements. Neither sled towing nor vest sprinting resulted in significant improvements in performance. The results indicated that the use of both training apparatus in unison may be required in order to improve performance during the acceleration phase of sprinting.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sprinting</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a synthesis of supply chain management and partnering strategies within the construction industry</field><field name="creator">Ward, Patrick</field><field name="description">Partnering and supply chain management (SCM) are concepts or approaches that can be applied as initiatives to solve problems in the construction industry and meet or surpass the expectations of supply chain members and final customers.

Worksites are an ideal location to promote regular physical activity. For workers, a large portion of waking hours is spent at work where numerous opportunities exist to accumulate physical activity. Consequently, the aims of this thesis were to: 1) systematically review worksite physical activity literature, especially in the New Zealand context; 2) identify the contribution of worksite activity to total activity levels, and the correlates contributing to physical activity levels for professional occupations; and 3) objectively measure physical activity changes with point of decision prompt visibility in professional worksites. Accordingly the thesis incorporated one systematic review and two separate studies.Effect sizes calculated in an analysis of previous worksite physical activity health promotion studies show inconclusive evidence for increased employee retention and job satisfaction, and no evidence of reduced absenteeism or productivity increases. A major criticism of worksite research is that many unvalidated and unreliable designs are used, limiting study efficacy. Research initiatives need to identify the determinants of physical activity for different occupations, ethnicities, and gender in New Zealand worksites.Study 1 (N=56) consisted of participants wearing two pedometers over a three-day block, and subsequently completing a Three-Day Physical Activity Recall (3DPAR). A moderate, positive Spearman correlation (r=0.28) existed between the METs (3DPAR) and total pedometer values. Contributions of (mean + SD)worksite (14 283 +4761), non-work (12 516 +4 172), and total (26 798 +8 933) pedometer values were analysed. The sample was divided into tertiles according to total step counts. The high activity group (HAG) achieved more physical activity outside the workday (56%) when compared to the lowest activity group (LAG) (29%). Physical activity correlates were identified using binary logistic regression and simple correlation analyses. Relationships between physical activity and active transport, manual work, sport and exercise, and individual exercise were shown.Study 2 evaluated the National Heart Foundation (NHF) point of decision prompts for increasing physical activity levels in professional worksites. Forty-six participants (27 men and 19 women) wore two pedometers for three days, over four occasions to monitor changes in physical activity. The study was a crossover design with Worksite 1 receiving the treatment for three weeks, followed by a six-week wash out period, then a three-week control. Worksite 2 was given the control prior to the treatment period. Results indicate that the NHF point of decision prompts were ineffective at increasing objectively measured work and total physical activity levels, showing trivial positive (0.04) to moderate negative Cohen effect sizes (-0.79). When point of decision prompts were visible in the worksites overall mean step counts decreased. On the basis of these findings, the NHF's point of decision prompts had no effect, or were potentially detrimental to physical activity.Nevertheless, both studies were limited by some traditional worksite design problems, including low participation and sample contamination. However, by incorporating an objective measure of physical activity (pedometers) and a robust study design, these findings are the first objective measures of worksite physical activity, and the effects of point of decision prompts in a confined sample.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness</field><field name="subject">Professional employees</field><field name="subject">Employee health promotion</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of moderate sleep loss on sleepiness levels and neuromuscular function in healthy males</field><field name="creator">Henaghan, Sharon M</field><field name="description">Sleep loss studies have traditionally focused on cognitive tasks involving alertness, memory, learning and reaction time as well as mood changes and increases in daytime sleepiness. The effects of sleep loss on neuromuscular performance are less well described and understood. Moderate sleep, i.e. loss of a few hours sleep a night, has not been studied with regard to muscular performance. This study examined the effect of moderate sleep loss on sleepiness levels and neuromuscular performance. Nine male subjects (30-50 yr) participated in a cross-over design study and were assessed for sleepiness levels by subjective sleep scales, central nervous system (CNS) arousal by critical flicker fusion (CFF), muscle strength and estimates of submaximal force production for both handgrip and the quadriceps muscle group, and finally fatigue was assessed by repeated maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) for the quadriceps muscle group. The study was conducted over a five week period and each subject reduced their sleep by 2 hr i.e. from 8 hr to 6 hr for one week. The subjects also completed a daily sleep log that reflected their sleep behavior over the study period. The neuromuscular performance assessments were conducted at the same time of day for each subject to minimise circadian rhythm affects. The results showed with moderate sleep loss, a significant increase in daytime levels of sleepiness as assessed by the Stanford Sleepiness and Epworth Sleepiness scales. There was an increase in negative mood states and a decrease in daily exercise times during the week of moderate sleep loss for those subjects who had normal daily exercise times that exceeded an hour. CFF did not change with moderate sleep loss. There was a 9% decrease in quadriceps maximal force and this was greater than the 2% decrease for handgrip maximal force. The decreases in muscle strength showed greater response from some individuals. Subjects were able to estimate submaximal force production and this estimation did not change with moderate sleep loss. There was no change in the rate of force decline (i.e. fatigue) for repeated MVCs. The conclusions from the study suggest that moderate sleep loss does increase levels of daytime sleepiness and the effect on neuromuscular performance is limited to some effects on maximal force production.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep</field><field name="subject">Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Muscles</field><field name="subject">Neuromuscular transmission</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethnography of children with dyspraxia participating in gymnastics</field><field name="creator">Hessell, Stephanie Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis describes three boys diagnosed with dyspraxia and their whanau (families and extended families) as they enter and become part of a community gymnastics group in a city in New Zealand. The study builds on literature that has defined dyspraxia in terms of dysfunction, but generally failed to resolve the disorder. Through the social perspective of health and well-being, participation of children and adults with disabilities has been explored in terms of the person and the environments in which they participate; however, the influence activity itself has on participation has not been thoroughly described. There has been a growing interest in the participation of children with disabilities in recreation and leisure activities and this study provides an in depth cultural perspective of such participation in New Zealand context. This study aims to answer the question "What do children with dyspraxia and their whanau do in a gymnastics group, and what does it mean to them to participate?". The overarching question is "What is the culture of a community gymnastics group in which children with dyspraxia participate?". Ethnographic methodology is employed to ensure that the participants' perspectives, including the beliefs, values and meaning that their participation holds is portrayed, while the associated activities and behaviours are also captured. As the boys with dyspraxia and their whanau entered the gym, they built on their previous experiences to make sense of what they needed to do and what meaning the environment held. I had not planned on the boys being integrated with an established group, but on the first night they spontaneously joined in with a noncompetitive, mixed age, boys group. The parents perceived the Club as professional, while the boys were initially intimidated. Fortunately, the equipment, which made the gym look like a playground, enticed the boys to participate. To shift the boys from their initial perception of the gym being a playground, the coaches used two styles of An Ethnography of Children with Dyspraxia Participating in Gymnastics coaching to support and encourage  their participation, while suppressing behaviour that did not fit with the norms of the Club. The boys needed to develop gymnastics skills and fit into the group to become gymnasts. The boys succeeded in fitting into the group by both developing skills and adapting their behaviour, while the type of boys without dyspraxia, the style of coaching afforded, the range of equipment and the activity of gymnastics itself meant that some of their initial difficulties were accommodated and they were seen as group members. The participants developed values and beliefs about what the boys participation in the group meant. Having fun and developing confidence and fitness were highlighted, while the social aspects (making friends and the whanau experiences) were also seen as important. The parents and coaches felt that the boys' experiences in gymnastics had an impact on them that would transfer to the world beyond the gym. This study contributes a qualitative perspective on the participation of children with disabilities in a sports occupation, with a focus on the cultural context of their participation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apraxia</field><field name="subject">Motor ability in children</field><field name="subject">Motor learning</field><field name="subject">Movement disorders in children</field><field name="subject">Gymnastics for children</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison between media representation of Asian international students and their own accounts of experience in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Qin, Xiaomei</field><field name="description">This research takes as its starting point the role of the media as a major influence on the way people understand and interpret events, focusing on media coverage of Asian international students in New Zealand. The thesis investigates the differences between media accounts of Asian international students and students' own perceptions of their experiences, using both quantitative and qualitative methods.This topic has become one of high community interest since 1999 when the New Zealand Government changed its education policy to encourage the expansion of the export education industry, leading to the number of international students increasing rapidly. Many of these students are teenagers and come from non-English-speaking Asian backgrounds to study in universities, colleges, high schools and private institutions in New Zealand. As well as the obvious effects on the New Zealand economy, the presence of these students has also influenced New Zealand culture. For example, many international students have homestay experiences with New Zealand families. This meeting of different cultural backgrounds introduces both sides to different value systems, lifestyles, beliefs and customs. This cultural diversity not only challenges international students to adapt themselves to New Zealand society, but also provides an opportunity for native New Zealanders to understand the incoming cultures. For Asian international students in particular, this process can be problematic and their behaviours have been closely scrutinised by the media.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Students, Foreign</field><field name="subject">Asian students</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The laxative effect of kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Patel, Minaxi</field><field name="description">Whole fruits, grains and vegetables contain thousands of potential disease-fighting, healthpromoting nutrients. These foods play a critical role in bowel function, especially in the elderly. Strong epidemiological evidence has shown that greater amounts of crude dietary fibre are associated with a lesser prevalence of constipation and other gastrointestinal disorders. Constipation usually presents as a variety of symptoms, including reduced frequency of defaecation and impacted forms of stools and/or increased effort required to defaecate. Constipation is a problem that could affect any person at any time in his or her life, but in the elderly is more prevalent.Although anecdotal reports and dietary advice have suggested the use of kiwifruit as a laxative in humans, there are, at present no data available to support this. Kiwifruit is reported as the most nutrient-rich of the top 27 fruits eaten in the world today. The laxative property of kiwifruit could provide a natural remedy for constipation and would be cheaper than the laxatives on the market.Objective: The main objective of this study was to investigate if kiwifruit can act as a laxative, especially in elderly people.Study Design and Methods: This study was carried out in two stages, as a pilot and then a main study. In the pilot study, 71 participants (aged 18 - 50y) were divided into Group I and Group II. Group I made no changes to their normal diet for a six weeks period, while Group II were asked to add one kiwifruit for every 30kg body weight per day to their diet for a six week period. After the six weeks, the two experimental groups crossed over, maintaining the dietary regime followed by the other group for a further six weeks. So each subject was his or her own control. Daily recording of the frequency and characteristics of the stool were made by the participants in a diary. In the main study, 42 participants (aged 60 years and over) carried out the same dietary regime as the pilot study subjects. Elderly subjects of Group I made no changes to their diet, but was asked to record their daily frequency and characteristics of their stool for 3weeks. Group II subjects ate one kiwifruit for every 30kg body weight per day for a period of 3weeks. After the three weeks period, the two groups crossed over.Results: It was found from the pilot study that kiwifruit consumption was associated with significant softening of the stool (P&lt;0.001); a significant increase in bulking of the stool (P=0.034) and the ease of bowel movement was improved (P&lt;0.001). For the main study, kiwifruit consumption also showed softening of the stool (P&lt;0.001) and the ease of bowel movement was improved (P&lt;0.001), there was a slight but significant increase in bowel frequency (P=0.012) and the bulking of stool (P=0.002).Conclusion: The results from this study provide evidence that consumption of kiwifruit enhances laxation and that bowel function can be improved through changes in diet, both for younger and elderly people.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kiwifruit</field><field name="subject">Constipation</field><field name="subject">Laxatives</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="subject">Fiber in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice determinants of donors giving to charities</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Fraser</field><field name="description">The research applied multi-criteria decision-making analysis to donor decisions regarding the choice of a particular charity in order to identify which donor attitudes are significant in the giving decision.

This thesis is aimed at designing a dependable finite element analysis (FEA) model of the vocal folds for frequency and dynamic analysis and for calculating the impact stress between the vocal folds during glottal closure. A three-dimensional model with irregular geometry and a layered structure was designed. The measured viscoelastic properties of the vocal-fold mucosa and the transverse isotropic elastic properties of the vocal fold muscle are applied to the model. The boundary conditions are assumed to be fixed on lateral, anterior and posterior surfaces based on anatomical structure analysis. This model is symmetrical about the right and left vocal folds.The frequency and dynamic characters are presented using the software ABAQUS. The FEA model is validated by both experimental modal analysis (EMA) model results and in-vivo experimental results from the literature.In the vibration analysis, the eigenfrequency and eigenmode of the FEA model are determined. The model results compare well with the experiments performed on a silicone vocal fold model. The eigenmodes show the vibration direction at different excitation frequencies. In the closure process, the closure and collision dynamic results are obtained. The results show that: (1) the closure process is independent of the subglottal pressure; (2) the glottal opening amplitude and closing velocity vary approximately linear with the subglottal pressure; (3) the maximum impact stress occurs on the mid area of the inferior surfaces; (4) the impact stress is approximately linear with the subglottal pressure; and (5) the impact stress will cause vocal fold tissue damage when the subglottal pressure is over 800 Pa.It is anticipated that the model will help to identify voice disorders such as vocal-fold paralysis and vocal-fold nodules.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Voice</field><field name="subject">Larynx</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Take away stories</field><field name="creator">Burgetsmaier, Patricia</field><field name="description">This project questions and examines the impact of 'take away' culture on our society's lifestyle.

It often leads to mobility limitations resulting from deficits in muscle performance.  While reduced muscle strength and rate of force production have been reported, little is known about the power generating capability of people after stroke and its relationship to mobility.  Research in other populations has found that measures of muscle power may have a greater association with activity performance than do measures of muscle force alone.  Consequently, in an attempt to optimise power, investigators have focused on identifying ideal parameters within which to train for power.  One such parameter is the identification of the loading level at which maximal power is generated.  Literature reporting optimal loads from both young athletic and healthy older populations has yielded mixed results, making the applicability to a hemiparetic population difficult.  The purpose of this study was to investigate muscle power performance at differing loads and to determine at what load muscle power is best elicited in hemiparetic and age and gender matched control groups.  A secondary aim was to ascertain whether there is a relationship between the muscle power values obtained and activities such as gait, stair climbing and standing from a chair.  Twenty nine hemiparetic volunteers and twenty nine age and gender matched controls were evaluated.  Involved and uninvolved legs of the stroke group and a comparison leg of the control group underwent testing.  Leg press muscle power was measured using a modified supine leg press machine at 30%, 50% and 70% of a one-repetition maximum (1-RM) load.  Participants were positioned on the leg press machine and asked to push, with a single leg, as hard and as fast as they could.  Data was collected via a mounted force platform and a linear transducer connected to a platform on which the participants lay.  From these, power was able to be calculated.  The activities were timed while being performed as fast as possible.  The results showed that peak muscle power values differed significantly between the involved, uninvolved and control legs.  Peak leg power in all three leg groups was greatest when pushing against a load of 30% of 1-RM.  Involved leg peak power tested at 30% of 1-RM (Mean:240; SD:145 W) was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than the uninvolved leg (Mean:506; SD:243 W).  Both the involved and uninvolved legs generated significantly lower peak power (p&lt;0.05) than the control leg (Mean:757; SD:292 W).  Correlations were found between the involved leg peak power and gait speed and involved leg peak power and stair climbing (r=0.6-0.7, p&lt;0.05).  No correlation was found between paretic leg peak power and chair stands. The control group leg peak power demonstrated significant associations with the performance of all three activities.In summary, there were significant differences between the involved and the uninvolved leg in power production after stroke.  As well, there are significant differences between the uninvolved leg and the leg of those not affected by stroke.  Power was related to a number of activities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Older adult</field><field name="subject">Muscle power</field><field name="subject">Activity performance</field><field name="subject">Muscle strength</field><field name="subject">Cross-sectional design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computerised detection and classification of five cardiac conditions</field><field name="creator">Gao, George Qi</field><field name="description">An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a bioelectrical signal which records the heart's electrical activity versus time. It is an important diagnostic tool for assessing heart functions. The interpretation of ECG signal is an application of pattern recognition. The techniques used in this pattern recognition comprise: signal pre-processing, QRS detection, feature extraction and neural network for signal classification. In this project, signal processing and neural network toolbox will be used in Matlab environment. The processed signal source came from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database which was developed for research in cardiac electro-physiology.Five conditions of ECG waveform were selected from MIT-BIH database in this research. The ECG samples were processed and normalised to produce a set of features that can be used in different structures of neural network and subsequent recognition rates were recorded. Backpropagation algorithm will be considered for different structures of neural network and the performance in each case will be measured. This research is focused on finding the best neural network structure for ECG signal classification and a number of signal pre-processing and QRS detection algorithms were also tested. The feature extraction is based on an existing algorithm.The results of recognition rates are compared to find a better structure for ECG classification. Different ECG feature inputs were used in the experiments to compare and find a desirable features input for ECG classification. Among different structures, it was found that a three layer network structure with 25 inputs, 5 neurons in the output layer and 5 neurons in its hidden layers possessed the best performance with highest recognition rate of 91.8% for five cardiac conditions. The average accuracy rate for this kind of structure with different structures was 84.93%. It was also tested that 25 feature input is suitable for training and testing in ECG classification. Based on this result, the method of using important ECG features plus a suitable number of compressed ECG signals can dramatically decrease the complexity of the neural network structure, which can increase the testing speed and the accuracy rate of the network verification.

In doing this it posits a historical and critical framework that considers the hyper-masculine1 and its relationship to gay men's masqueing.21 In this exegesis hyper masculinity is taken to mean an exaggeration of stereotypical male beliefs and behaviors through an emphasis on virility, strength and aggression and dress codification.2 Frye (1957), in his Anatomy of criticism offers a useful definition of masque as I frame it in this thesis. The term may be understood as "a species of drama in which spectacle plays an important role and in which the characters tend to be, or become aspects of human personality, rather than independent characters" (pp. 365-7). In this respect the masque is something donned that presents a decodable identity extra to, or other than the actual personality of the wearer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Military</field><field name="subject">Masque</field><field name="subject">Hyper-masculine</field><field name="subject">Homosexuality, Gay</field><field name="subject">Male</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The job seeking experiences of Chinese international students</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Heng</field><field name="description">The aim of this qualitative research is to discover what kind of difficulties recently graduated Chinese international students have faced in finding paid work in New Zealand, and conversely what kind of advantages or opportunities their background as international students may have provided in locating jobs.

Central to the creation of these worlds is imagery published in various public access media such as television, the internet, print publishing. Although filtered and interpreted personally, because of their ubiquity and familiarity, these images collectively constitute representation of our culture. Our construction of the world (the way we represent it to ourselves) is contingent on our encounter with such images.Sited within the milieu of a media-fixated age, the project aims to deal with our desire to make sense of the litter of images that people our visual horizon. The project seeks to employ these images as objects of direct experience and to consider the subjective frameworks and cultural narratives through which they are filtered.The work will play on the desire to make relational sense of images, often by invoking narrative.

It does not follow a strictly premeditated path or a rigid time line. An intuitive, organic approach is adopted instead, to complement cultural traditions, taking time to build understanding, trust and respect.  A collection of contemporary fashion garments and textiles is produced, inspired by yet distinct from these traditional textiles. The collection is synthesized i.e., it combines elements of tapa and kalamkari to form a coherent whole. This collection has contemporary relevance, while retaining the traditional handcrafted component of tapa and kalamkari.

The challenges in solving MCPO problems are related to the interdependencies that exist among the parameters and constraints that may be applied to the solution.This thesis examines the MCPO problem to construct a model that captures essential parameters to be solved using optimization algorithms. The purpose of the model is to make it possible that a solution for an MCPO problem can be generated automatically. A software application has been developed to provide a framework for validating the model.The development of the software has uncovered a host of geometric operations that are required to enable optimization to take place. Many of these operations are non-trivial, demanding novel, well-constructed algorithms based on careful appreciation of the nature of the problem.For the actual optimization task, three algorithms have been implemented: a greedy search, a Monte Carlo method, and a Genetic Algorithm. The behavior of the completed software is observed through its application on a series of test data. The results are presented to show the effectiveness of the software under various settings. This is followed by critical analysis of various findings of the research.Conclusions are drawn to summarize lessons learned from the research.

These were compared with those in control sites, where the rodent populations had not been manipulated. The arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps set in young podocarp-broadleaf, mature kanuka and mature taraire forested sites, and each treatment site was matched with two control sites. Data was collected monthly from all nine sites from December to May, 2005-06. In kanuka forest, data collected during December to May, 2004-05 has also been used.Rodent populations and possum populations were monitored during the course of the study. Tracking tunnel indices indicated that rat numbers were lower in the treatment sites than the control sites during 2005-06, and that rats were low in abundance at the treatment sites, apart from the occasional spike in numbers, in the three years prior to the start of this research. Mice tracking indices were relatively high at some specific sites, mainly in spring and autumn. Evidence indicated that possum abundance was low in both the treatment and the control sites.Ground weta were more abundant at the kanuka treatment site than the control sites in 2005-06, but were rarely found in the podocarp-broadleaf and taraire forest types.  Carabid beetles were trapped in greater numbers in podocarp-broadleaf and kanuka forest treatment sites in 2005-06, than in their respective control sites, and an increase in carabid beetle abundance was recorded between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 sampling seasons at the kanuka treatment site. Prowling spiders were more abundant at the podocarp-broadleaf treatment than at the control sites. Cave weta abundance at the podocarp-broadleaf and kanuka treatment sites was similar to their respective control sites. The arthropod abundance data from the taraire forest sites was confounded by many differences between the treatment and the control sites, which may have masked any effects caused by the suppression of rodent numbers at the treatment site.Ground weta and cave weta in the larger size classes appeared to be selectively preyed upon by predators, however, it was unclear whether rodents were entirely responsible because stoats and cats are also known to target larger arthropod prey, and their presence was not monitored.Ground weta in kanuka forest, carabid beetles in kanuka and podocarp-broadleaf forest and prowling spiders in podocarp-broadleaf forest are identified as potential indicators for monitoring the effects of rodent control in the Waitakere Ranges.This study was limited by a lack of knowledge of life histories and basic ecology of the arthropods. Further research at these sites is required to establish the long term population patterns of the arthropods.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Possums</field><field name="subject">Rats</field><field name="subject">Mice</field><field name="subject">Ground Weta</field><field name="subject">Cave Weta</field><field name="subject">Carabid beetles</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arguments, argumentation and agreement: a symbolic convergence study of the Lake Omapere Project</field><field name="creator">Ruth, Newport A</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is the construction of a shared vision for the environment.  Specifically, the purpose of this research was to examine the construction of shared vision between different rhetorical communities for the Lake Omapere Restoration Project.  In this investigation, I applied Bormann's (1972; 1983) symbolic convergence theory to the communication processes of the Resource Management Act (1991).  The intended outcome of this research was to gain further understanding of the communication processes in place within the Resource Management Act 1991 in order to foster a more holistic, bicultural approach for the development of Aotearoa New Zealand*.  My premise was that shared understanding through storytelling could be a useful tool for producing equitable bicultural environmental decisions. This research is concerned with how that shared vision is created rhetorically.  It is based on the theoretical understanding that language constructs people's social reality (Escobar, 1996; Pearce, 1989).  The literature review established that people make sense of the material world through language, deep emotional connection to the land and decision-making processes.  This discussion of the different ways people come to view the material world provided the background for the central research question.  The primary research question that guided the investigation was how do different rhetorical communities construct shared vision for the environment?  In order to answer this question data were collected using archival records retrieved from the Northland Regional Council.  The analysis of the data involved the application of Bormann's (1972; 1983) symbolic convergence theory to the construction of shared vision for the polluted condition of Lake Omapere in Northland.  The fantasy theme analysis of the texts revealed two fantasy themes personifying Lake Omapere: first, the story of the dying lake, followed by second fantasy theme of the salvation of the lake.  These two fantasy themes provided the rhetorical ground for the evolution of shared rhetorical vision for the restoration of the wellbeing of Lake Omapere.  Following Bormann (1972; 1983), the study showed that symbolic convergence theory accounts for the irrational as well as rational aspects of positive collaborative action for the environment.  This research has contributed to knowledge by showing that Bormann's (1972; 1983) symbolic convergence theory is a useful framework for explaining the process by which different rhetorical communities construct shared vision.  The fantasy theme analysis approach was specifically designed for this research.  Burke's (1966) "hexed" pentad was used in the initial stages of analysis to determine the elements of the fantasy themes.  This study showed that construction of shared vision encompasses at least three forms of communication: consciousness creating, raising and sustaining.  The study also contributed further questions as to the nature of the resulting shared vision.  This study shows that the democratic dialogue that is produced from sharing stories can result in justice.  The emergence of shared vision produced a new reality and an altered worldview where kaitiakitanga** has become a crucial focus for the future of Lake Omapere.  The restoration of the wellbeing of Lake Omapere through establishing kaitiakitanga is now a rhetorical reality and will shape future decisions made regarding the management and restoration of the lake.  The implications involved with incorporating the indigenous spiritual relational perspectives in legislation are a crucial concern for environmental decision-making both locally and internationally and further application of symbolic convergence theory research in this area is recommended.* Aotearoa New Zealand combines both the M&#257;ori and English names and is used in this thesis to acknowledge the bicultural intention of environment resource management.** Stewardship.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">Collaboration with Maori and evironmental projects</field><field name="subject">Cultural respect and considerations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The merging of fact and fiction binaries within suicide</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Paul Steven</field><field name="description">This explorative research examines a contemporary representation for suicide.

Most previously proposed algorithms have been specifically designed for one type of dataset thus making them unsuitable for a range of datasets. There have been a few techniques suggested to provide performance for these association rules mining algorithms. However, these algorithms do not support a high level of user interaction, relying only on the classic support and confidence metrics for expressing user requirements. On the other hand, techniques exist that focus on improving the level of user interaction at the cost of performance.In this work, we propose a new algorithm, FOLD-growth with Constraints (FGC), which not only provides user interaction but also improves performance over existing popular algorithms. It embeds the user defined constraints into a pre-processing structure to generate constraint satisfied itemsets and uses this result to build a highly compact data structure. Interestingly, the constraint embedding technique makes existing pattern growth methods not only efficient but also highly effective over a range of datasets, irrespective of their data distribution. The technique also supports the use of conjunctions of different types of commonly used constraints.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fatal cycle</field><field name="creator">Steer, Laurie</field><field name="description">This art project focuses in a voyeuristic way on the fatality and futility of war.

The research presumes war exists as a continuous fatal and futile cycle. Within this investigation fatality is defined as accepting the conditions of death, dying and disaster while also alluding to the philosophical concept of fate: futility is defined as pointless, hopeless or useless.

It is found in the midst of movement and can also be conceived as that which frames, or holds all movement. A principal focus of the thesis is to distinguish the therapeutic value of this stillness.The research methodology is hermeneutic phenomenology. Within this framework a choreographed dance work and written exegesis comprise and are equal parts of the whole. The choreography for the dance work employs a neo-classical-contemporary technique particular to the choreographer. A story and a journey are presented - providing a vehicle for the central theme of the thesis - stillness within movement, to be best elucidated. A Christo-centric philosophy and worldview are ground of the work.The dance work is choreographed on and presented by four dancers. These four dancers and four 'watchers' are the research participants. As the dance work evolved it was presented 'in process' and the participants interviewed subsequent to the showings. These interviews were not psychotherapy sessions, so data about interventions, process and outcome does not appear. Rather information was sought about the essence of the danced / watched experience, with particular attention being given to the felt experience of stillness. Data gained from these interviews constitutes the findings of the research.The findings show that the particular stillness exampled in this dance work is therapeutic, and therapeutic experience for the individual participants was realised. The data suggests the stillness was experienced in a number of different ways.These include: a personal relationship with chaos, the significance of relationship with each other, the particular relevance of design and time in the individual's life, the meaning of authenticity, the relevance and meaningfulness of symbolism, and the personal understanding of awareness, focus and release.This research shows that we who are psychotherapy clients, practitioners, and people of all walks would greatly benefit through including into daily life this 'stillness immanent within movement.'</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dance</field><field name="subject">Movement</field><field name="subject">Choreography</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Time</field><field name="subject">Stillness</field><field name="subject">Authenticity</field><field name="subject">Symbolism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of consumption values on motorcycle brand choice</field><field name="creator">Gaskill, Adam</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to identify the brand choice moderators that influence consumers' choice of one brand over another.

Despite the importance of the implementation process within strategic management, this is an area of study often overshadowed by a focus on the strategy formulation process. This thesis concentrates on the strategy implementation process, investigating barriers to strategy implementation. A research framework called the Organisational Minefield was developed to represent the importance of the implementation process to organisations. In contrary to most studies available in strategic management, this research included participants from all levels of the organisation.To identify barriers to strategy implementation, a case study of Air New Zealand was conducted. This involved focussed interviews with 28 participants from the Network and Revenue Management Department of Air New Zealand. Other sources of data such as research articles and secondary company data sources were also used.The findings revealed that: participants from different levels of the organisation have unique perceptions of the implementation process; implementation variables could become roadblocks that undermine the implementation process; these barriers can be overcome if managers are perceptive to the organisation's current situation; and the Organisational Minefield framework presented verified the significance of the role of barriers in the implementation process. The findings add two additional barriers to implementation, namely leadership and power. It was also discovered that the participants acknowledged that these two barriers will impede or enhance the success of Air New Zealand. This was backed by the level of commitment and loyalty shown by the participants, which brought Air New Zealand one step closer to unravelling the mysteries of the implementation process.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic implementation</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Change management</field><field name="subject">Implementation variables</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationships among extrinsic cues, perceived quality, perceived sacrifice and perceived value : a cross national study</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yang</field><field name="description">Consumer perceived value is an important concept in marketing and plays a significant role in purchase decision-making. Consumer perceived value can be markedly influenced by product cues. The current research investigates the impact of extrinsic cues (country-of-origin, brand name, store name and price) on consumer perception of product quality, sacrifice and value developed by Teas and Agarwal (2000). Since little research has examined the generalisability of Teas and Agarwal's (2000) work in less economically developed countries, this research is conducted in a Chinese population.The relationships among four manipulated extrinsic cues, perceived sacrifice, quality and value are tested. Since Teas and Agarwal (2000) did not investigate the mediation affects of perceived sacrifice in the relationship between perceived quality and perceived value, this will be also explored as an additional study for this paper. Thus, the current research expands on previous work on perceived customer value by examining the mediation affects.After the conceptual model of Teas and Agarwal (2000) has been examined, the findings support hypothesized linkages between each of the four extrinsic cues and perceived quality, price and perceived quality, perceived quality and perceived value, perceived sacrifice and perceived value. The results show that perceived sacrifice mediates the relationship between perceived quality and value. The results also indicate that the linkages between the extrinsic cues and perceived value are mediated by perceived quality but are not mediated by perceived sacrifice. Although the results show that one hypothesized mediation affect is not supported, the overall structure of the model is supported across countries.The findings are similar to the study of Teas and Agarwal (2000) which suggests that Chinese and Western consumer behaviours are alike in most situations. For example, brand building is a critical cue to the desired success because it can promote perceptions from both quality and value perspectives. However, this research found that Chinese consumers use product evaluation cues in a different way from Western consumers. The major difference is that, if the price is lower than the reasonable average price-level, Chinese consumers may consider the product to be a big bargain with perceived high quality. This may suggest that marketing managers can use discount and price promotions in China. Therefore, discussions and managerial implications of this research provide advice for managers to formulate appropriate strategies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand name products</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experience of dyspraxia in everyday activities : a phenomenological study</field><field name="creator">Blijlevens, Heleen</field><field name="description">While dyspraxia has been studied from the neuro-anatomical aspects, few studies have explored the experience of adults with dyspraxia in the course of their everyday activities. This study reveals the unique and complex experiences of five adults as they struggle to live with dyspraxia.The research is underpinned by the phenomenological perspective. Participants were filmed performing everyday activities of their choice and were interviewed on their experiences of dyspraxia with everyday activities.The stories and videos reveal the struggle participants have with their unknowing and unwilling bodies, puzzled thinking, unfamiliar surroundings, and unhandy tools. Despite the enormity of their struggles, participants persevere, using individual strategies to overcome obstacles. The findings show that the lived-experience of dyspraxia tends to remain hidden from the person, as well as the clinician. Much of what is taken for granted during everyday activities is shattered in the lives of people with dyspraxia. The automatic, smooth, unconscious way activities are done, tools are handled and the world is experienced is altered. The path to recovery remains unclear as dyspraxia makes itself known one day and not the next. Sheer determination and a hope for the future helps participants carry on with trying to reclaim the person they lost as a result of the dyspraxia.The importance for understanding, by clinicians of the impact of dyspraxia on people's everyday lives cannot be underestimated.

However, rider discomforts caused by seat contact, as well as various pathologies effect participation and enjoyment of this activity. The potential causes of these pathologies are discussed, along with the methods used, to establish the link between cycling and the various pathologies. Of particular interest in this thesis, is the measurement of the comfort and pressure of different seat designs. The level of comfort felt may be a precursor to pathological damage and be of prognostic value when assessing and designing seats. Pressure seems to be one of the best and most direct methods to assess the cyclist-seat interaction and offer information as to possible pathologies. The purpose of this thesis was to examine the effects that a standard, partial cut-out and complete cut-out seat have on comfort and stability, in male, female, novice and experienced cyclists, and seat and handlebar pressure in male and female cyclists on a non-stationary bicycle.With regards to the results, the standard seats' mean and peak anterior seat pressures were significantly higher than the partial and complete cut-out seats (partial mean 19.1% and peak 16.8%; complete mean 66.1% and peak 72.6%). Mean and peak posterior pressure of the standard seat was significantly less than the cut-out seats (partial mean 16.5% and peak 12.3%; complete mean 21.6% and peak 21.2%). Overall peak pressure was significantly greater (22.8%) on the standard seat compared to the complete cut-out seat, but not significant (7.2%) compared to the partial cut-out seat design. Significantly lower mean handlebar pressure was associated with the standard (11.2%) and partial cut-out (14.7%) seat designs. There was no significant difference between seats for peak handlebar and mean overall pressure. The standard and partial cut-out seats had the highest sit bone, overall seat, overall riding, hand comfort and stability. The complete cut-out seat provided the greatest crotch comfort, but the lowest comfort and stability for all other factors investigated.It would seem that in terms of pressure distribution the partial cut-out seat would be the best option for cyclists, regardless of gender. In terms of comfort it is recommended that experienced and novice male cyclists should use the standard seat, experienced female cyclists use the partial cut-out seat and novice female cyclists could use either the standard or partial cut-out seat. However, pressure may be of more importance than comfort as it is more likely to influence pathological damage; therefore overall it is recommended that cyclists use the partial cut-out seat. The major draw back of the complete cut-out seat was the decreased perception of stability. With continued use of the complete cut-out seat this may become a better and more user-friendly option with a possible increase in perceived stability. Future research is required to examine any long-term effects in using cut-out seats in pathology prevention.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bicycles</field><field name="subject">Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Sport Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential learning in journalism education: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">Boyd-Bell, Susan</field><field name="description">Teaching journalism in tertiary institutions presents challenges, including how students learn to work in teams under the sort of pressure that characterizes workplace journalism. This thesis is a case study of how a group of students at AUT University, in Auckland, experienced taking responsibility for producing four editions of a student newspaper as part of their journalism training. Based on a series of individual student interviews, before, during and after their experience, this research suggests that the key factor in their learning was their being allowed, to a large extent, the power to make their own decisions about the appearance and content of their product, while still being charged with the responsibility of ensuring it reached a highly professional standard. The realities of life as a journalist, including recognizing the frequent need to prune, tighten or re-angle stories - even to reject them - and the vital role of co-operative teamwork, unparalleled in their other journalism studies, were driven home.The two tutors, interviewed after the last edition, put some of the student observations into context and provided insights into the discipline involved, as teachers, in maintaining training as a priority, while ensuring production to deadline of a series of reputable and legally safe newspapers.This case study suggests that while there are contrived aspects that cannot replicate a "real" newsroom - such as the students' assignment to editorial roles without the status of real editors or chief reporters - the learning experience resulted not only in advances in the students' technological skills but significant development in their critical thinking about the profession they were due to enter.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Journalism education</field><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">Problem-based learning</field><field name="subject">Student empowerment</field><field name="subject">Student newspaper</field><field name="subject">Structured interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information and communication technology in Auckland hotels: context and impact</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Ann</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to identify how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) affects business processes and service delivery within hotels and how ICT interacts with strategic issues confronting hotel managers. The areas of exploration were: 1) the business context of ICT; 2) the main role of ICT in day to day business; 3) ICT's impact on service delivery to hotel guests; and 4) the role of ICT in the future.As the study was exploring the General Managers' (GMs) perceptions, interviewing was selected as the most appropriate data gathering method. The sample covered a range of Auckland hotels which differed according to location, size and quality. Semi-structured interviews were used to facilitate the comparison of data between interviewees. Common themes and concepts were identified which were compared to the demographic characteristics of the hotels as well as previous research detailed in the literature.The contextual issues identified were staff availability and retention, competition (particularly price wars resulting from discounting), and location and infrastructure issues. Only half the GMs interviewed identified benefits from ICT in the day to day operation of their business. All of them described challenges or disadvantages posed by ICT. The impact on service delivery to guests was viewed more positively but there were still misgivings about the potential barriers which ICT created. There was a strong view that staff were of overwhelming importance to service delivery. Finally, envisioning the future, ICT was perceived as having the ability to make a strong contribution to business development but this ability would be constrained by staffing problems. Analyses of the findings suggest that ICT has a dual role of gathering management data and providing guest services, and GMs appear unaware of how this dual role contributes to the challenges posed by ICT. Similarly, there was limited awareness of the interaction between human agents in a business, the organisational structures, and ICT.The business implications of these findings suggest that GMs would benefit from being aware of the roles of ICT and addressing the needs of staff for a clearer understanding of how their role, and the ICT that supports it, fits into their broader operation of the business.This study is the one of first to examine the impact of ICT in New Zealand hotels, and, in particular, how this interacts with the broader social issues, and offers insights into the areas of potential conflict and ways to manage the impacts of ICT in hotels.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured interviews</field><field name="subject">Management perception</field><field name="subject">Service delivery</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maximising the benefits from free trade agreements : lessons for New Zealand?</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Dingzi</field><field name="description">Free trade agreements (FTAs) now play an increasingly significant role in international trade. The removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers through a bilateral FTA could promote and facilitate trade in both directions by increasing the opportunities available to exporters from both countries. Beyond opening up important new market access opportunities, these agreements may also deepen economic integration with trading partners and thus strengthen trade and economic relationships. Drawing on conventional and new trade theoretical approaches, this thesis attempts to suggest that new trade theory might be more superior to shed light on policies to secure greater benefits from FTAs.There is now an extensive body of literature analyzing the economic impacts of FTAs. In common with a broader division in trade theory (Rangasamy 2003), this literature may be classified into two categories; namely, that informed by conventional trade theory (which has a neo-classical foundation) and new trade theory. The conventional approach is one grounded on the theories of trade creation and trade diversion pioneered by Viner, and based on the assumptions of perfect competition and constant returns in production, this strongly emphasizes a neutral policy environment to ensure the gains from trade and FTAs are reaped. The new trade theory is based on an opposing set of assumptions emphasizing the existence of imperfect competition and economies of scale (see e.g. Dixit and Norman 1980, Krugman 1980, 1981, Helpman, 1981). In this view, neutral incentives and laissez faire policies are not always beneficial to industrial development as advocated by conventional trade theory. On the contrary, government policies play an increasingly important role to ensure the gains from trade and FTAs are realized.Drawing on the perspective of new trade theory, a number of important policy suggestions have been put forward to improve the gains from FTAs, including profit-shifting, innovation and R&amp;D, and industry clustering arguments. In addition to these theoretical insights, the practical experience of FTAs in Singapore may present further lessons. The available evidence suggests that FTAs have brought tremendous gains in terms of trade and GDP growth, welfare improvement, as well as structural changes. The Singaporean government has put in place an extensive policy framework to ensure that these benefits are maximized. A close examination of the policy mix that they have pursued should therefore have important implications for policy makers in New Zealand.In light of the theoretical framework and empirical findings, the present thesis makes a number of policy suggestions with regard to the maximization of the long term benefit of FTAs in New Zealand economic settings. These suggestions aim to deal with the impact of FTAs and enable New Zealand to compete more effectively for profit in an FTA environment.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Free trade</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where is she? A female manager's place in Australian and New Zealand hotels</field><field name="creator">Mooney, Shelagh</field><field name="description">This study seeks to answer the question of what significant barriers are present for  women managers in the organisational structure of hotels in Australia and New  Zealand that impedes their progress to top management positions. Women seem to be  under-represented at senior management levels in hotel companies and this  exploratory research endeavoured to find out why this is the case.The research was carried out in conjunction with a major international group  represented by more than 30 hotels in both countries. It consisted of an online survey  sent to the hotel group's female supervisors and managers and a series of 18 follow  up interviews. There was a high response rate to the survey and from respondents  wishing to be interviewed. Issues arising from the research included organisational  culture, the Old Boy Network, geographical mobility, role models, and the pathway to  General Manager.The research concluded that for female managers aspiring to proceed up the career  ladder in Australian or New Zealand hotels, it would be difficult for them to combine  family life and career in the same manner as their male colleagues. There were also  negative aspects of hotel culture and organisational practices that disadvantaged  women at various stages of their career life cycle. If hotels companies wish to retain  more women, they need to review whether their organisations consist of 'opportunity  'structures' (Scully 2003) or 'inequality regimes' (Acker 2006) for women.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hotel industry</field><field name="subject">Female managers</field><field name="subject">Organisational culture</field><field name="subject">Career progression for women</field><field name="subject">Barriers for women</field><field name="subject">Australasia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Counting the Beatz : hip hop culture, commercialisation and the state in Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jeffs, Nick</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the interplay between hip hop culture, music and the state and commercial entities in New Zealand. Hip hop is a culture which is diverse and unique in that it can be viewed as both a form of expression and a form of empowerment for various cultures. It can also be used to make a profit for commercial organisations such as the recording and broadcasting industries. This study therefore seeks to approach the study of New Zealand hip hop in an innovative manner, and to provide a fresh perspective.There is also the need to provide a plausible definition which captures the complexities of hip hop culture. An assessment of both the American and New Zealand scene will provide a contrast in order to demonstrate that in both scenarios hip hop has the ability for empowerment and to create a new space for communities. Commercial exploitation has transformed hip hop in America, has severely reduced its ability to be seen as a source of public good and has reduced key aspects of the culture. New Zealand has managed to retain many elements of the sense of community and space of community inherent in hip hop culture and music. However commercial entities are gaining prominence in the exploitation of this culture. Hip hop locally has not made the transition to a purely commercial model, but is currently under threat.The means by which commercial organisations are gaining prominence is the unique aspect which shapes New Zealand hip hop and will be a focus of this study. State funding via New Zealand on Air (NZOA) is assisting in the transformation of hip hop from a source of public good to a music form capable of generating profit for organisations such as the recording industry. This study therefore will analyse the relationship between those who embrace hip hop as a culture capable of creating a sense of public good, organisations which are commercially exploiting this culture as a musical form, and the role of the state in assisting with the transition between public good and private consumption.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rap (Music) - History and criticism - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Rap (Music) - Social aspects - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Cultural Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand hotel industry : the role of image as a medium influencing company's competitiveness and customer loyalty towards brand</field><field name="creator">Binkowska, Barbara</field><field name="description">The New Zealand hotel industry: the role of image as a medium influencing company's competitiveness and customer loyalty towards brand.This thesis evolves around image and its significance while developing customers' loyalty and increasing company's competitiveness in a highly competitive market. The topic is studied in-depth from the organisational perspective and delves into the differing motivations of hotel operators towards shaping favourable image as well as examining how the hotel's image affects customer loyalty and helps the company to increase its competitiveness. Finally, it analyses and compares which public relations tools are the most effective in the process of image creation and developing customer loyalty. From this perspective image becomes a central issue impacting company's future growth, performance and finally success.The research was conducted on the Auckland international hotel chains. Auckland hosts numerous conferences and events that drives demand for accommodation and in a way, creates a conducive environment to hotel operators for future expansion. Thus, hotels compete strongly with one another constantly looking for a competitive advantage by growing their customer base. My thesis outlines the hotels' management efforts and analyses their strategies in the context of changing customers' demands and market trends.With respect to methodological issues, my thesis is based on a qualitative approach and follows an interpretivist paradigm. The research background has been delineated as have been my respondents' profile to provide additional information about the organisation they represent. The research findings described at the end of this thesis document how important image is for a modern hotel and what initiatives should be followed to ensure success.Image and loyalty are closely interrelated as positive image affects customers' loyalty. In order to achieve a balance between sustaining a competitive advantage and increasing loyal customer base a number of managerial implications have been discovered. Detailed analysis of these findings may help the companies to establish a more favourable position in the global market and create mutually beneficial relationships which further help the organisation to grow.Having aimed at exploring the importance of image as a medium that affects company's competitiveness and customers' loyalty towards brand, this study has provided some useful indications for hotel companies as to what should be undertaken to gain loyal customers and improve company's performance on the market.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image</field><field name="subject">Loyalty</field><field name="subject">Brand</field><field name="subject">Auckland hotels</field><field name="subject">Competitiveness</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying post-critical approaches to refugee-centred education</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Maria</field><field name="description">It is the existence of trauma and its associated responses that categorize refugees as different from other migrants. These circumstances create significant and complex special needs which this thesis suggests should be addressed (initially) on resettlement programmes. Because of the high vulnerability of refugees as a consequence of previous losses and their exposure to sustained deprivation, empathy must be a primary requisite of teachers who are responsible for delivering these programmes. This thesis enquires whether the teaching methodology and approach for refugee resettlement programmes, however, should entail more than just an empathic disposition and indeed whether educational programmes should seek to address the unique and very special needs of refugees through the imparting of 'critical' skills and strategies. Furthermore, the thesis investigates the various educational theories and approaches that appear to have particular correspondence with the unique needs of refugees.The six-week period at the Mangere Refugee Reception Centre represents a significant moment in the lives of refugees. It is for many the turning point from their traumatic past to a future of hope. During this 'renaissance' period, the Centre for Refugee Education under the auspices of AUT University, offers an education programme for all quota refugees. It is this programme, in particular, that forms the focus of this thesis; however the principles and recommendations have wider ramifications and could (with modifications) equally apply to refugee provision in the wider sector. The broad aim of this thesis is to investigate what it is that refugees need on arrival in New Zealand and the extent to which the content and methodology of the orientation programme offered to refugees can be enhanced to better support and prepare refugees for the transition into New Zealand society. A teaching approach heavily nuanced by the post-structural appropriation of critical theory is discussed and it is proposed that this approach in conjunction with collaborative, participatory and constructivist elements could form a 'refugee-centred approach' which has the potential to more effectively and appropriately address the specific needs identified as pertaining to refugees. An oft-heard criticism of 'critical theory' and its many renderings is that it is 'too theoretical' and difficult to implement. This thesis argues that the post-structuralist interpretation can, indeed translate into practice and suggestions for its pedagogical implementation represent a key outcome of this research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Needs of refugees</field><field name="subject">Resettlement in New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Centre for refugee education</field><field name="subject">Mangere refugee reception centre</field><field name="subject">Critical theory</field><field name="subject">Post-structural approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the effect of a civics information intervention on the participation of year 13 students in the 2004 local body elections in North Shore City</field><field name="creator">Baillie, Pamela</field><field name="description">Young people in the Western world demonstrate that they have little connection to democratic processes through their increasing absence from the polls at election time. This trend is evidenced in New Zealand where the secondary school curriculum has little content concerning electoral and political processes. Low voter turn-out is particularly prevalent in the triennial local body elections where only a small proportion of all eligible voters participate.This research is based within two North Shore City secondary schools and has two objectives. The first to establish the current understanding of Year 13 students of the local authority, its activities, governance and decision-making processes and the second to assess the effect of this information on the election activity of the participants. Following the provision of this information to the selected classes and after 2004 local authority elections, the same classes completed questionnaires to ascertain whether their participation (voting and non-voting) in the elections was affected by this intervention. A post-election focus group of non-school-based newly eligible voters enabled some qualitative inquiry into rationale and attitudes.The findings indicate a wide degree of ignorance and reinforce the current political situation where young people see no relevance to them of local authority politics.

Chinese translations of culture-specific items in a Harry Potter novel.</field><field name="creator">Shaio, Yah-Ying Elaine</field><field name="description">The present research concerns the translation of the Culture-Specific Items (CSI) from the original English version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban into two Chinese renditions, a Mainland Chinese version and a Taiwanese version. CSI translation involves not only the transmission of language but also that of culture. In this research, the writer seeks to establish how the two professional translators dealt with four areas of CSIs in the relevant translations. These four areas are: character names, place/shop names, charms/magic formulae, and magical creatures. These are the elements that are important in constructing the background and atmosphere of the story, and sometimes carry cultural or language specific connotations that are difficult to translate. The researcher analysed the CSI translation strategies used by the two translators on the basis of a new categorisation, based on previous researchers' taxonomies. By analysing both quantitative and qualitative data, the thesis writer was concerned with how these CSIs were translated into the two versions, whether the two versions tend to be source-text or target-text oriented, and how the connotations of the originals were conveyed in the target texts. The study found that the translation of proper names, such as character names and place/shop names, was more conservative, which may have been due to traditional Chinese translation conventions. The renderings of these two groups of CSIs showed a significant tendency toward the preservation of the original sounds. By comparison, substitutive strategies were used more frequently in the translation of magic formulae and magical creatures than in the translation of character names and place/shop names. Findings of this research also indicated that even though both translators preferred conservative strategies in most cases, the Taiwanese translator seemed to have adopted substitutive strategies in a slightly larger number of cases than the Mainland Chinese translator. At the end of this thesis, some possible explanations of the differences found between translations of the two versions are presented, followed by some suggestions for further studies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barriers to strategy implementation : a case study of Air New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tan, Yii Teang</field><field name="description">The ability to implement strategies successfully is important to any organisation. Despite the importance of the implementation process within strategic management, this is an area of study often overshadowed by a focus on the strategy formulation process. This thesis concentrates on the strategy implementation process, investigating barriers to strategy implementation. A research framework called the Organisational Minefield was developed to represent the importance of the implementation process to organisations. In contrary to most studies available in strategic management, this research included participants from all levels of the organisation.To identify barriers to strategy implementation, a case study of Air New Zealand was conducted. This involved focussed interviews with 28 participants from the Network and Revenue Management Department of Air New Zealand. Other sources of data such as research articles and secondary company data sources were also used. The findings revealed that: participants from different levels of the organisation have unique perceptions of the implementation process; implementation variables could become roadblocks that undermine the implementation process; these barriers can be overcome if managers are perceptive to the organisation's current situation; and the Organisational Minefield framework presented verified the significance of the role of barriers in the implementation process. The findings add two additional barriers to implementation, namely leadership and power. It was also discovered that the participants acknowledged that these two barriers will impede or enhance the success of Air New Zealand. This was backed by the level of commitment and loyalty shown by the participants, which brought Air New Zealand one step closer to unravelling the mysteries of the implementation process.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient dynamics at Matapouri Estuary, Northern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Soliman, Nabil Zaki Gadalla</field><field name="description">Mangrove forests are an integral part of coastal wetlands in temperate and tropical regions of the world, including New Zealand. These coastal plants act as a shelter,feeding and breeding grounds for marine and terrestrial organisms. Many overseas studies have investigated the importance of mangrove and seagrass habitats in sustaining coastal food chains. In New Zealand, however, only a few studies have addressed the ecology and food web dynamics of these temperate ecosystems.As a first step to investigate the nutrient dynamics of estuarine food webs in temperate estuaries, this study aimed to quantify the nutrient concentrations in the catchment and the estuary of Matapouri, northern New Zealand. Field studies involved the collection of surface fresh and estuarine water (during low and high tides). Plant material (mangrove and seagrass), and sediment samples were collected at various sites within the estuary. Chemical analyses were carried out to determine the concentration of C, N, P and Si macronutrients and Fe and Zn micronutrients during different seasonal rainfall events.The results suggest that mangrove habitats may act as a source of POC, but not DOC for the adjacent aquatic habitats (i.e., seagrass, sand flats, channels), while seasgrass beds contribute more N to the estuarine system than the mangrove forests. The concentrations of N and P nutrients are strongly influenced by both the freshwater inputs and the bio-chemical processes within the estuary. The results obtained point to the freshwater streams as the main source of Si and Fe in the estuary. However, Zn was higher in the estuarine water compared to the catchment freshwater. NO3 -, NH4 +, Fe and Zn concentrations showed strong responses to the higher rainfall months reaching their highest level during the winter and early spring seasons. Conversely, P concentrations showed a negative seasonal pattern, which was linked to monthly rainfall events.Mangrove sediments may operate as a sink for the heavy metal Zn in Matapouri estuary. Iron concentration in seagrass leaves exceeded that in mangrove leaves by 65 orders of magnitude. The study suggests that seagrass plants could be used as a biological indicator of iron concentration in the estuary. The complex dynamics of bio-chemical cycles in Matapouri indicate that each habitat within the estuary has specific nutrient contributions to the estuarine food web system. However, the catchment and oceanic influences must also be considered in the nutrient balance of these coastal environments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mangrove swamps</field><field name="subject">Mangrove plants</field><field name="subject">Mangrove ecology</field><field name="subject">Estuarine ecology</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Individualised modelling using transductive inference and genetic algorithms</field><field name="creator">Mohan, Nisha</field><field name="description">While inductive modeling is used to develop a model (function) from data of the whole problem space and then to recall it on new data, transductive modeling is concerned with the creation of single model for every new input vector based on some closest vectors from the existing problem space.

There is, however, little understanding about the underlying mechanism. Recent research has alluded to a neurophysiological mechanism mediated through supraspinal pathways in the central nervous system, that may alter motor activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of neck manipulation on the excitability of cortical motoneurons by means of activating corticospinal pathways to the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle in an active motor system using the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique.Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited by TMS and recorded in 20 normal subjects using established procedures. The peak-to-peak amplitude of MEPs were measured both before and after C6/7 manipulation and before and after neck positioning. Both interventions were applied to the normal subjects in random order on two different days. MEPs were recorded immediately after the intervention, then seven minutes and 14 minutes later to assess the time course of the effect. Five neck pain subjects participated in the manipulation experiments. The effects of manipulation, resulting in joint cavitation, were also explored. Two trials were undertaken before the intervention and these served as control measures. MEP data was represented in two ways. Firstly, 40 MEPs were averaged over 120 seconds; secondly, 15 MEPs were average over 60 seconds. A percentage change calculation was used to express the data relative to the baseline. Alterations in cortical excitability before and after manipulation were analysed by repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the MEP data, and percentage change scores.Cortical neurons projecting to FCR were significantly facilitated up to 60 seconds after the manipulation of the non-painful segment, relative to baseline values and the positioning control. A small but significant latent increase in excitability was also observed 15 minutes after manipulation. The response to manipulation of the painful cervical segment was significantly different from that of the non-painful segment. When manipulation of the painful segment did not result in joint cavitation, an inhibitory effect was observed. In contrast, however, cortical motoneurons were facilitated when joint cavitation was associated with manipulation.In conclusion, motor activity is enhanced with neck manipulation when cortical motoneuron excitability is measured by TMS in human subjects performing a voluntary contraction. This may explain the clinically observed improvement in spinal motion and motor control with spinal manipulation. Further, joint cavitation may be important in signifying the success of the joint manipulation. The excitatory effect on cortical motoneurons is probably mediated through a transcortical pathway by means of the activation of muscle afferents with the manipulative thrust.These findings assist in understanding the neurophysiological mechanism underlying the effect of spinal manipulation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neck</field><field name="subject">Manipulation (Therapeutics)</field><field name="subject">Motor Activity</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alienation theory and its relationship to contemporary Arte Povera practice</field><field name="creator">Conger, Elizabeth C</field><field name="description">In this Exegesis I explore the rehabilitation of marginalized materials through a sculptural practice.

The physical makings are the ignition for later developments. Once the installation has been set up, the performativity is transferred to the audience. The surrounding space becomes activated because of the energy released by the audience's engagement. Heuristic use of intuition and informal experience was applied in my working process to discover imperceptible traits of materials and daily situations. Active Documentation helps me to re-consider, re-negotiate, reflect and renew my work throughout the project. In this way, hidden codes can be brought out to the surface.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Home</field><field name="subject">Cyberspace</field><field name="subject">Smooth texture</field><field name="subject">Striated</field><field name="subject">Shifting boundaries</field><field name="subject">Residues</field><field name="subject">Information technology and art</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photographic estrangement: the measure of distance in photographic relationships</field><field name="creator">Olsen, Claire</field><field name="description">This research project investigates how estrangement is manifested within the photographic image, and how levels of estrangement establish conditions for the relationships between the subject, viewer and artist. Since the medium's inception the photographic process has involved encountering and negotiating otherness and the place of strangers. Over time a consistent photographic power dynamic has been established, and this project examines to what extent participants in this dynamic can escape or yield to the historically sedimented structures in which they find themselves participating. The images in this body of work tread the line between typological portraits and tentative encounters with strangers. These encounters/images do not suggest personal identity but question what it is to be a photographic subject. Rather than offer psychological insight into the subject, they attempt to foreground the signifying systems and process of photographic "representation". The project explores estrangement through physical and conceptual distance, negotiating photography's relationship to the real as a process, an image and an object.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Portraiture</field><field name="subject">Photographic theory</field><field name="subject">Indexicality</field><field name="subject">Photographic distance</field><field name="subject">Photographic space</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Locotypes: an exploration of an alternative signage system that challenges the current approach of prioritising conformity in designing and reading of wayfinding signage systems</field><field name="creator">Lam, Letitia</field><field name="description">Locotypes is a practice-based research project that is intended to suggest an alternative approach to traditional ways of designing and reading wayfinding signage systems.

It regulates and reinforces the behaviour of people. It moulds people to operate within the prevailing social environment. If these powers claimed for the mass media are universal, they can be very useful in the settlement processes of new comers to our country.This thesis research the alleged powers of mass media among a distinct social group, new female residents of Taiwanese origin who do not have English as their first language. With the assistance of the Taiwanese Women's Association, the researcher collected thirty questionnaires and conducted four in-depth interviews from their members and friends.The findings of research suggest that female television consumption patterns identified by Morley and Hobson are not fully applicable to this group of women. The improvements of technology and accessibility provided new conditions for the power relations and consumption patterns of these women.Although the women in this research did use mass media to enhance their settlement processes in New Zealand, mass media did not seem to have a dominant influence on their settlement process immediately after their arrival. Other Taiwanese who have been living in New Zealand were the main source of information and social activities. The importance of mass media grew as these women spent more time in New Zealand. They reported using media products to acquire information about New Zealand and to improve their English. However different media categories seemed to influence the social life of these women differently. High users of local free to air television programs responded to the social questions more negatively than high users of other media categories. At the same time, those who used predominantly Chinese Satellite television responded themost positively. It leads to the speculation that exposure to local television content may hinder their settlement processes.The lack of English language skills was a factor that constantly surfaced in this research. While these women did use English language media, their level of understanding is problematic. Subsequently, some women used Chinese language media to supplement the information gap. However the importance and use of ethnic media for diasporic communities is problematised because of accessibility and quality issues.Migrant settlement is conceptualised in different ways. It changes with the social ideology of the country and the time. The findings of this research suggest that universal settlement indicators may not be applicable to these women. More significantly, the women seem to see that successful settlement is not a pre-requisite of happiness. While these women may not have a high level of integration into the wider communities, the Taiwanese communities are sufficiently large enough to deliver a range of services to satisfy their social needs.In the course of this research, the researcher realised that a range of personal and social reasons influenced the settlement process and the media consumption patterns of these women. The findings did help to promote understanding these women; they also left more questions to be explored.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mass media</field><field name="subject">Mass media and women</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Description, dueting, seasonal variations, and individual identification of the vocalisations of the brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli)</field><field name="creator">Corfield, Jeremy</field><field name="description">Vocalisations of the endangered Brown Kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) are currently used in a nationwide monitoring program to assess the health of a number of small remnant populations. Only an estimate of population health can be obtained from these surveys. This has to form the basis for a number of critical management decisions. The ability to identify kiwi individually during monitoring would greatly improve the accuracy and quality of information obtained and provide a wider base of knowledge when management decisions are made. This study produces a detailed description of the male and female kiwi call, including duetting and seasonal variations. It then explores whether kiwi demonstrate individually distinctive vocalisations, which could be used in conservation management of kiwi.Calls from seven male and four female kiwi were recorded from Rarewarewa, Whangarei between the 5th of May 2003 to the 31st of April 2004. Two call variables (call duration, number of syllables), two temporal syllable variables (syllable duration, syllable gap duration) and five syllable spectral variables (frequency with the most amplitude, high frequency, low frequency, start frequency, end frequency) were measured from 48 male and 14 female calls. Variables from each call were used to describe and classify calls using one way repeated measures ANOVAs and Discriminant Function Analysis. Males contained on average 24 syllables and females containing on average 22 syllables, with calls from both sexes lasting on average 28 seconds. Male and female kiwi calls differed in multiple spectral, temporal and structural features. Dueting rates and behaviour differed between pairs. Some pairs almost always called in duets, whereas others never dueted. Dueting behaviour also changed seasonally with fewer duets occurring in the non-breeding season and with females initiating more duets in the breeding season. Call structure did not differ between the breeding and non-breeding season. Although the sample size was not sufficient to test for this.Statistically significant differences occurred among nearly all variables between individual male and female kiwi calls, despite statistically significant difference occurring between syllables within calls. Frequency variables were the most important variables in discriminating between individuals, but multiple spectral and temporal variables were needed to separate all individuals. Discriminant Function Analysis was able to correctly classify 87.5% of male and 85.7% of female calls correctly when using the means of the seven syllable variables and the two call variables and 68.2% of male and 66.8% when using the values from each syllable. The latter was improved to 85.9% of male calls correctly classified when only 3 syllables from the middle of the calls were used in DFA, reflecting the variation found at the beginning and end of calls.Brown kiwi show strong signs of individually distinctive vocalisations, which remained consistent over a one year period. The conservation implications of individually distinctive vocalisations and how this feature could be incorporated into the current monitoring of kiwi are discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">North Island brown kiwi - Behavior</field><field name="subject">North Island brown kiwi - Vocalization</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Networks, technology and regional development: small tourism enterprises in Western Southland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clark, Vanessa</field><field name="description">Tourism is increasingly being used as a tool to stimulate regional development in rural areas.  Small tourism enterprises (STE) lie at the heart of the industry and form a major part of the tourism sector.  Characterised by flexible organisational structures and small size, STE are well positioned to respond to a growing demand for unique personalised visitor experiences.  Information and communications technologies (ICT) enhance access to information, improve the efficiency of business activities and promote networking between businesses, community and travellers at the local, regional and international level.Western Southland is a predominantly rural region in the far south of New Zealand. Promoting the development of a cohesive tourism industry in the Western Southland region will benefit individual operators, their communities and the region as a whole. Using the case of Western Southland, this study explores the profile and characteristics of STE; their perceptions of the value of networking and collaboration, and their attitudes towards and use of ICT.  Also considered are the implications of STE attitudes and behaviour in relation to the New Zealand Tourism Strategy and the New Zealand Digital Strategy goals in shaping regional development.  A variety of business and community stakeholders are part of the broader case study contributing a rich understanding of the dynamics of the region.  A mixed method approach is used to collect data through a series of semi-structured interviews and a survey. Key findings show that limited planned networking is occurring and there is a need to increase STE awareness of the benefits of collaborative activities in order to promote active engagement with other STE.  Existing networks are found to be largely informal and embedded in the social and cultural context of communities.  The level of ICT use by STE varies, and considerable support is required to encourage operators to upskill.  National development goals promote ideals of sustainable communities and businesses, and are aligned with what operators envisage for their region.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism SME networks</field><field name="subject">Small and medium enterprises</field><field name="subject">Tourism strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Tourism business networks and ICT</field><field name="subject">Rural tourism in New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Community based tourism development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 2008 Olympic Games : leveraging a "best ever" games to benefit Beijing</field><field name="creator">Tian, Jing</field><field name="description">This Thesis undertakes a leverage analysis of mega-events in the context of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. A leverage analysis apparently different from a impact analysis; it focuses on how to maximize the potential positive impacts and minimize the negative impacts for an event that will be held in the future. To analyze the circumstance of the Beijing Olympics that are amendable to leveraging, the research methodology employed is empirical with method of semi-structured in-depth interviews with the government officials, tourism industry people and the local community members in Beijing. This thesis research conducted a leveraging analysis from three perspectives: environmental, socio-cultural, and tourism/economic perspectives. From each perspective, four angles would be investigated: identifying the potential impacts of 2008 Olympics; determining the leveraging activities for the potential impacts; uncovering the opportunities for leveraging the potential impacts, and exploring the challenges in leveraging the potential impacts. Because there is not any existing theory on a leverage analysis in the context of Beijing Olympic Games, this research was conducted with the guidance of "grounded theory". The research indicated that the government aims to take use of the opportunity of hosting the "Green Olympics" to reap the ambition of making Beijing into a "greener" city, but how long would the policies last when the games are over is essential for the effectiveness. Similarly, the socio-culture would be leveraged by implementing the "People's Olympic" theme. Finally, the tourism in Beijing would be leveraged by a series of leveraging activities derived form the Olympic Games. The findings of this thesis research will contribute to the event studies and the leveraging studies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Olympic Games (29th : 2008 : Beijing, China), Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Desperately seeking a national identity : an examination of narrative in the Heartland television series and its influence in defining New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Smith, Philippa</field><field name="description">Television permeates our daily lives. Ninety seven per cent of New Zealand households have a television set and the average watching time is estimated at 20 hours per week (Grimes and Tyndall, 1999). This exposure to television has been recognised as an important factor in the way we see and identify ourselves as a nation - how we seek to find signs and symbols that construct a shared identity and culture that make us New Zealanders and distinguish us from other nations.Using narrative theory combined with critical discourse analysis this thesis aims to show that, even in factual programmes, stories can be constructed that convey messages of nationhood and belonging, creating and recreating a national identity that present New Zealanders in a positive way and seek to bind them as a nation.Three episodes of the television series Heartland, a popular documentary in the mid-1990s that explored the people and lifestyles in different locations around New Zealand, were selected for analysis focusing on narrative structure, the social actors and the role of the narrator. Critical discourse analysis was employed to look at the connection between language, image and text, and discursive practices as well as the relationship the text has in a socio-cultural context.The analysis found that the programmes followed a similar narrative structure to that of a fictional story involving changes in states of equilibrium that created a sense of concern or anxiety associated with what it means to be a New Zealander. However the subsequent resolution of these anxieties combined with the entertaining role of the programme presenter Gary McCormick and the involvement of social actors, resulted in a version of New Zealand's national identity being represented as a reality through a positive discourse of the population working towards a socially and culturally harmonious society.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National characteristics</field><field name="subject">Nationalism</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of variable fluid-properties plate heat exchanger for educational purposes.</field><field name="creator">Protheroe, Michael</field><field name="description">In this thesis a novel computer based model is developed which accurately simulates the operation of a plate heat exchanger (PHE).

This project has functioned as lightening the load of the burden of grief and loss through the process of making an art installation exploring a migrant Samoan experience.My project is concerned with the exploration of Samoan matters of cultural significance such as heritage, religion, identity and family, in particular those customs pertaining to deaths and funerals. The mores and values implicit in these reflect the fundamental aspects of obligation and reciprocity in Samoan life and society. As a Samoan-born and New Zealand raised woman, my work and explorations tended to engage with the challenges of disrupting boundaries formed around ideas of cultural appropriation and cultural authenticity.Therefore this project investigates my position as a migrant Samoan living in New Zealand exploring notions of mobility and globalisation and the effects on the obligation to reciprocity through practical art means. Importantly my art practice intends to explore and position the installation of contemporary materials to speak metaphorically about my identity and issues significant to the obligation to reciprocity in the fa'aSamoa (the Samoan way or in the manner of the Samoans; according to Samoan customs and traditions) particularly the concept tautua aiga (tautua means functions or any service performed in order to support aiga or family)Conceptually my work addresses and brings forth for consideration the impact of mobility and globalisation on cultural issues and practices.

This model attempts to characterise the nature of the intangible relationship value that flows through a business-to-business buyer-seller relationship from the seller's perspective. However, the testing of that model has previously been restricted to the manufacturing sector (Baxter &amp; Matear, 2004; Zhang, 2004). Considering the differences between the manufacturing and service sectors, it is necessary to examine the applicability of Baxter and Matear's IRV model in service industries. As a part of the examination of the model, a literature review was first performed; it concluded that the IRV model has potential to be applied in service industries.As a second step in the examination of the model's applicability, based on the data collected from 82 business service and consulting companies, an exploratory factor analysis found that the IRV in these companies was reflected in two dimensions: the human intangible relationship value and the structural intangible relationship value. The human intangible value was in turn reflected in three dimensions: competence, attitude, and intellectual agility. The structural intangible value was likewise reflected in two dimensions: relationships, and renewal and development. In addition, this intangible relationship value in service industries was confirmed to be associated with the future financial performance of the relationship. These findings indicate that the broad structure of the Baxter and Matear (2004) model was replicated in the service industries surveyed. However, one contrast in the current study with that of the Baxter and Matear model is that this study did not identify the "organization" dimension.Although this thesis has made a clear contribution to the marketing literature and provided some suggestions to managers in service industries, it has a few shortcomings. For example it had a small sample size, and did not evaluate the influence of time on relationship value. There is also some uncertainty concerning the reason for the lack of identification of the sixth value dimension, organization, which was clearly identified in studies in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, the applicability of the Baxter and Matear (2004) IRV model in the service sector needs to be further researched.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Service industries</field><field name="subject">Customer relations</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the academic writing problems of New Zealand-born Samoan students in tertiary institutions</field><field name="creator">Fanene, Naila</field><field name="description">Academic success is clearly linked to one's ability to write well. Given this close link between the two and the poor academic record of Pacific Island students within mainstream education in New Zealand, it is surprising that very little research has been undertaken to examine the academic writing problems of Pacific Island students. This emancipatory, critical study focused on tertiary students who identified as New Zealand-born Samoan. Since Samoans constitute half the Pacific Island population in New Zealand, New Zealand-born Samoan participants were chosen as being representative of this larger group. They were also chosen because they represented a group of New Zealanders identified as disadvantaged in terms of their largely low socio-economic status and poor academic achievement levels.The theoretical framework for this study is grounded in Bernstein's critical theories on communicative and teaching practices in mainstream education which disadvantage minority students from working class communities. These theories are discussed in conjunction with a general review of relevant literature in Chapter 2. The Samoan researcher in this study has added an inter-generational commentary to some of the views and experiences of school and Samoan homelife in New Zealand of participants, firstly from the perspective of her own first-hand experiences of school and Samoan homelife in the 50s and 60s and secondly from the perspective of an experienced English language teacher in New Zealand tertiary institutions.This study used a triangulation approach to enhance reliability and validity of quantitative and qualitative data collected. Three data collecting instruments were used: a written questionnaire, face-to-face interviews, and students' actual essay assignments. A written questionnaire was completed by 14 students who identified as NewZealand-born Samoan. A case study approach was then used with a sub-group of five students, representative of the original 14, who were interviewed more closely in the following areas of interest which emerged through the questionnaire: students' perceived and actual academic writing skills, communicative and teaching practices of high school and tertiary teachers, students' learning strategies, the role and effectiveness of Pacific Island support staff and programmes and the impact of the cultural and communicative practices of Samoan parents in traditional, bilingual Samoan homes on students' academic performance and success in the formal learning environment. The impact of factors such as poor self-motivation and time-management skills, inadequate reading skills and a lack of understanding of and exposure to the academic discourses of the formal learning environment, on the academic writing problems of the participants in this study, were also examined.Teaching methods which perpetuated rote learning practices amongst students were reported by participants in this study from both low and middle-decile high schools. The communicative and teaching practices of Pacific Island teaching staff were also examined in this study. Relevant data from the one-to-one teaching sessions with participants were also included as part of this study.

The two main objectives are: 1). to provide information on users' requirements, and 2). to assess and refine where needed the usability approach and techniques (usability instrument) for such a task.The applied research is informed by usability methods and is emergent in that the aim is to apply the best method for the task at hand, to reflect on outcomes and then do the next step. Initial interviews and some fine-grained analysis of data types from existing data were done. In-depth inquiry into actual users was seen to be needed to get a more detailed picture of not only the specific needs but also to put that into a wider perspective of users' life values and goals. Several interviews were conducted. The usability 'methods' of building personas and user profiling were applied to the data but the end result did not reflect the breadth and difference in users. In-depth analysis of the interview data lead to identification of a number of crucial areas that require further research, importantly; how computer-based systems would enhance the learning relationship and get young people involved and how access, security and validity would be designed. The concept of Maori as a group user was proposed, which includes the roles of knowledge holder, technical expert and end user with each role using the system in a different, but cohesive, way. Further work needs to be done in investigating sub-groups within Maori not covered in this study; particularly young people and people living in rural areas. In summary, the research raised more questions than answers in terms of user requirements, however it did produce applied investigation of methods that can be used to progress the gathering of user requirements and providing a basis for usability.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people) - Genealogy</field><field name="subject">System design</field><field name="subject">Whakapapa - Kupu</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the implementation of enterprise systems within government organisations in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vevaina, Paeterasp Darayas</field><field name="description">The 1990's saw a rapid growth in the use of Enterprise Systems by organisations to undertake quick and strategic decisions.

This research encompasses the factors which affect the implementation process of an Enterprise Document Management System and thereby render it a success or a failure. The study used an ethnographic approach in order to introduce rigour in the research. The data was collected by conducting eight semi-structured interviews at the client organisation. The interviews were transcribed and later coded using an open - coding methodology. A thematic analysis based schema was developed to later analyse the coded data.The research found that, factors such as change management, behaviour management / emotions, communication, implementation process approach and system functionality had profound effects on the implementation success of the Electronic Document Management System in the research organisation.

Psychotherapists who work with traumatised clients can potentially experience terror, anger and despair; causing secondary traumatic stress that can lead to compassion fatigue and burnout. So, how do psychotherapists, who often carry their own trauma histories, bear such fear and pain when being with and listening empathically to traumatised clients without feeling overwhelmed or losing a sense of hope? The purpose of this grounded theory study was to identify the main concerns of psychotherapists when working with traumatised clients and to describe and generate a conceptual model that explains the processes therapists use to continually manage these concerns. Over a period of ten months, eleven psychotherapists with a minimum of five years work experience were recruited from the New Zealand Association of Psychotherapists (NZAP). Constant comparative analysis of eleven interviews generated through open-ended questions was carried out. A total of twenty-one drawings obtained at different stages of the participant interviews, were used to fully capture the inner world of the traumatic impact. The emerging theory, whose development is grounded in the data, shows that psychotherapists grow through three main psychosocial developmental stages of balancing the impact of trauma: DOING to protect from pain and fear, BALANCING doing with being, and BEING with trust, pain and joy. The participants, however, were likely to involuntarily recycle the three stages when experiencing personal traumatic stress or organisational stressors, in addition to holding clients' trauma. The intention of this research was to raise awareness of work-related traumatic stress, and to provide an educational conceptual model to assist psychotherapists' understanding of how to positively manage secondary traumatic stress and its impact on the physical, emotional and spiritual, before it manifests in burnout, disillusionment or illness.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapists</field><field name="subject">Job stress</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acuity of force appreciation in the osteoarthritic knee joint</field><field name="creator">Brereton, Helen P</field><field name="description">Osteoarthritis and ageing have been shown to induce changes in the number and health of peripheral mechanoreceptors. Whilst position and movement awareness in the osteoarthritic knee have been studied extensively, little work to date has been produced on muscle force awareness in this subject group. Poor force acuity may contribute to muscle and joint pain and dysfunction, and additionally hinder rehabilitation efforts in an osteoarthritic population. Overestimation of the muscles forces required for a given task, resulting in greater joint compression forces, may aggravate and inflame osteoarthritic symptoms. Underestimation of required muscle forces may amplify existing joint instability, increasing the risk of injury in an osteoarthritic population. Additionally, both under and overloading of muscles during the rehabilitation process can delay the return to full function after injury.When regarding the neurological process of force coding, current debate centres on the relative importance of centrally generated motor command mediated 'sense of effort' versus the peripheral mechanoreceptor signalled 'sense of tension' as the dominant coding process, with central mechanisms favoured in the majority of studies published to date. The purpose of this study was to investigate muscle force awareness in the knee extensors and flexors and hands of subjects with and without knee joint osteoarthritis. Twenty one subjects with knee joint osteoarthritis and 23 age and gender matched subjects with no known knee pathology were evaluated. All subjects performed ipsilateral isometric force estimation and force matching tasks, at levels scaled to individual maximum voluntary capacity (MVC). Errors in estimation and matching acuity were normalised to reference targets (comparison force/reference force) giving a relative score (RS) to allow comparison across submaximal force levels with RS less than 1.0 indicating that subjects produced insufficient force and vice versa.Maximal voluntary capacity tests revealed significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) peak knee extension torque (111.2 Nm versus 145.3 Nm), but similar peak knee flexion torque (46.1 Nm versus 45.4 Nm for osteoarthritis and control subjects respectively). A pattern of overestimation at low reference levels and underestimation at high reference levels was demonstrated by all subjects. In the lower limb, force appreciation differed significantly between muscle groups regardless of knee condition, with knee extensors demonstrating greater overall accuracy than knee flexors. There was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in force estimation ability and a trend to significance (p=0.066) for force matching acuity across groups at the 10% MVC test level. A significant (p&lt;0.05) group difference in grip force estimation ability between the lowest and highest target levels was demonstrated.It can be concluded that there are small differences in force acuity in osteoarthritis subjects at lower submaximal force targets when compared to healthy age matched peers. The notion of information redundancy, whereby no new proprioceptive inputs, regardless of origin, are able to effect an improvement in force acuity in a given situation has been demonstrated in previous studies that reported relatively stable force matching acuity at forces between 30% and 60% of maximal capacity. The poor comparative force perception demonstrated in this study by the osteoarthritis group at the lower submaximal test levels supports the notion that centrally generated copies of motor commands do not provide sufficient data to adequately encode force magnitude at low levels of force generation, evoking a greater reliance data received from peripheral mechanoreceptors. This has significant implications for this subject group given that the majority of daily tasks require only low levels of force generation. Given that perceptive acuity in a variety of sensory modalities has been shown to improve with training there may be a role for force perception training in older adults with osteoarthritis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Force</field><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Matching</field><field name="subject">Estimation</field><field name="subject">Proprioception</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining enjoyment of life in the process of living with high cholesterol : a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Reade-Raethel, Valerie R</field><field name="description">Hypercholesterolaemia (high cholesterol) is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. Much has been written on managing high cholesterol levels including the use of drug therapy and recommendations about beneficial lifestyle changes relating to nutrition and exercise in particular. Despite this, and the need for patients to engage in self management of a condition which may impact invisibly on their health, little is known about how people living with this risk factor actually manage.The purpose of this grounded theory study is to investigate people's process of living with high cholesterol. Eight participants with self reported high cholesterol levels were interviewed and their data analysed using the process of constant comparative analysis, open coding, selective coding and theoretical coding. A substantive theory in the area of patient self-management of high cholesterol levels was generated through the use of this approach. The theory developed was the basic social process of Maintaining Enjoyment of Life, with two supporting categories, Accepting and Getting On With It.Maintaining Enjoyment of Life was central to the participants' process of living with high cholesterol and the recommended health directives. The identification of this basic social process adds to our understanding of the influences on individuals' motivation for behaviour change and adherence to lifestyle changes. The findings of this study provide understanding that issues relating to behaviour change and adherence are not so much about denying that anything is wrong or not taking personal responsibility, but more about trying to hold on to something important, around which the participants' lives revolve. This is Maintaining Enjoyment of Life. By focussing on this basic social process, which is grounded in the participants' data, health professionals could work more effectively towards empowering patients to identify their own individualised strategies for self-management of high cholesterol. In addition, health directives could focus more on process rather than on do(s) and don't(s).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hypercholesteremia</field><field name="subject">Blood cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hollywood, Wellywood or the backwoods?</field><field name="creator">Conor, Bridget</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the New Zealand film industry and its historical and ongoing relationship with the Hollywood film industry. It will critically evaluate the notion that New Zealand now has more autonomy and independence in the international film industry and the analysis will examine the realities for both the New Zealand and Hollywood film industries by unravelling the hype and rhetoric at both core and periphery.There has been a huge amount of activity, discussion and 'hype' surrounding feature film production in New Zealand in the last few years, particularly in the wake of The Lord of the Rings production and its international success. There is also optimism that changes in the dominant US mode of production and the rise of a global entertainment industry is diminishing the centralised power of Hollywood and creating new opportunities for international filmmaking outside the US.The New Zealand industry (like many other 'national' cinemas) has always struggled between commercial and cultural imperatives for filmmaking. Using a political economy approach, this thesis examines these two imperatives as threads through the development of a national film culture in New Zealand and the constant struggle against the dominant power of Hollywood film. It works to uncover the false and often contradictory dichotomy between the two polarities, cultural and commercial.Recent policy initiatives and the activities of the New Zealand Government in terms of feature filmmaking are also examined. The initiatives of the New Zealand Government are embodied in the 'Brand NZ' slogan that has been employed in order to promote New Zealand as a location for global production capital. The central argument is that a third, hybrid model has become increasingly visible as a complex 'partnership' has developed between a Hollywood studio, New Line Cinema and a national government, New Zealand's.A slogan such as 'Brand NZ' indicates that this third model is primarily a commercial construct. What is not made clear in the New Zealand context and is in fact, obscured by the hype and rhetoric, is that this third model is also a core-periphery model. Therefore, the much vaunted independent and more autonomous national film industry in New Zealand is largely illusory.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion picture industry</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomics</field><field name="creator">Carthew, Richard</field><field name="description">Abstract This project is concerned with visual representation of human gross anatomy*. The subject is complex because it derives from an intersection of artistic and scientific disciplines and is an active field of research. The overall aim of the project is to open up new ways of interpretation when engaging with complex visual representations of anatomy. The project involves a consideration of the methods and models in which the communication of visually complex information is achieved by using a combination of artistic and scientific representation. It explores methods and techniques used in the creation of visualisations that are intended to convey scientific knowledge. Literature and visual reviews were undertaken and these examined research material which informed the project's exploration. These reviews included texts that studied the historical development of anatomic representation and also contemporary visual material. Elements of cognition and perception and their relationship to visual communication were reviewed and considered in relation to the project's practical work. Wider socio-cultural contexts that affect pictorial style in anatomic representation were also reviewed and some relevant contexts are discussed within the exegesis. Practical exploration included developing models of anatomy that combined elements from artistic and scientific approaches. For example, in some explorative work, the fine detail of traditional anatomic representation formed one section of a model and this was allied with another section that used a more scientific approach to isolate key structures by illumination. The exegesis concludes with a summary of the project, conclusions arising from the research and an indication of potential areas for further study. * For conciseness, all further references within the exegesis to anatomy and anatomic representation refer to human gross anatomy unless otherwise stated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anatomy and representation</field><field name="subject">Art and science</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="subject">Medical illustration</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Computer mediated communication</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition on Waiheke: changing ways we view and inhabit the landscape</field><field name="creator">Wakefield, Juliet</field><field name="description">This thesis project explores, through art practice that is informed by sociological and theoretical considerations, a transition taking place on Waiheke Island, in Aotearoa, New Zealand.

The methodological tool provides insights into the quality of the art galleries' marketing activities, categorising promotional material according to their level of visibility/public accessibility and required individual involvement. The promotional material was considered according to three different dimensions of meaning: (1.) The textual dimension of meaning (Fairclough, 1992); (2.) The visual dimension of meaning (Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996; 2006); (3.) The local dimension of meaning (Scollon and Scollon, 2003). The innovation of the newly developed model lies in the combination of these three dimensions coming from the three different theoretical and methodological areas of thought: Critical Discourse Analysis, Systemic Functional Analysis, and Mediated Discourse Analysis. The model takes the above mentioned three dimensions together in order to categorise and assess a gallery's current marketing approach, and to then recommend a gallery's enhancement of marketing strategies to either deepen or broaden their audience. The visibility/involvement model also provides understanding of a gallery's underlying ideology and can explain why a certain gallery emphasises a particular marketing approach more than another cultural organisation and what implications that might have for future developments. This thesis challenges the view that traditional marketing strategies apply to arts marketing. Following Venkatesh and Meamber's (2006), who account for the cultural production process, drawing on McCracken (1986; 1988), this thesis attempts to engage in a holistic arts marketing approach. In order to attempt a holistic analysis, the thesis is based on analysis of galleries' visual signs, mission statements, and sent-out invitations. A central argument in the thesis is that each class of promotional material implies different properties, and hence requires an altered promotion strategy based on the target audience and the main communicative intention. The concept entails that the audience becomes narrower and more homogeneous from the category of visual signs to the class of sent-out invitations. Likewise, the communication needs to become more personal and specific. The audience layer model, an application of the visibility/involvement model introduced in the final chapter of this thesis, illustrates the relationship between the audience and promotional material.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Organisational contexts</field><field name="subject">Organisational culture</field><field name="subject">Organisational reality</field><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tool support for social risk mitigation in agile projects</field><field name="creator">Licorish, Sherlock Anthony</field><field name="description">Software engineering techniques have been employed for many years to guide software product creation. In the last decade the appropriateness of many techniques has been questioned, given unacceptably high rates of software project failure.  In light of this, there have emerged a new set of agile software development methodologies aimed at reducing software projects risks, on the basis that this will improve the likelihood of achieving software project success. Recent studies show that agile methods have been gaining increasing industry attention. However, while the practices recommended by agile methodologies are said to reduce risks, there exists little evidence to verify this position. In addition, it is posited that the very processes recommended by agile methodologies may themselves introduce other risks. Consequently, this study addresses the risks inherent in the human collaboration practices that are central to agile methods. An analysis of the risk management literature reveals that personality conflicts and customer-developer disagreements are social risks that occur through human collaboration. These risks negatively affect team cohesion and software project success. Personality conflicts are said to be mostly influenced through poor team formation, whereas customer-developer disagreements are induced through excessive customer direct interaction.  However, these risks are not adequately addressed by standard risk management theories.  Furthermore, an evaluation reveals that these risks are also not considered by existing software tools.This study therefore designs and implements a web-based solution to lessen the social risks that may arise in agile projects. The Agile Social-Risk Mitigation Tool (ASRMT) offers support for personnel capability assessment and management and for remote customer feature management, extending the customer's access through an interface. Using software engineering experts to evaluate ASRMT, the tool is shown to effectively address social risk management theories, and is considered likely to assist agile developers in their handling of social risks. In addition, above and beyond its intended purpose, ASRMT is also likely to assist agile teams with general project management. The findings of the ASRMT user evaluations demonstrate sufficient proof of concept to suggest that such a tool could have value in live software projects.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="subject">Agile methodologies</field><field name="subject">Project management</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="subject">Software tools</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of steel foundry by-product in the treatment of stormwater</field><field name="creator">Ren, Jiyang</field><field name="description">The capacity and efficiency of melter slag (provided by New Zealand Steel) to remove heavy metals and suspended solids from stormwater samples are studied in this thesis. A series of batch tests were carried out to investigate the adsorption-desorption mechanism of the slag to remove heavy metals (Cd2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+) from working solutions. The results showed that all the tested metallic ions could be removed by mixing the melter slag with the working solutions. Adsorption and ion exchange are the dominant mechanisms in this process. The adsorption capacity follows the descending order of Cu2+ &gt; Zn2+ = Cd2+. Varied binding energy of different metallic ions to the slag resulted in competitive adsorption between ions.A variety of substances: inorganic salts (KCl, NaCl, KNO3 and sea water), organic acids (citric and tartaric) and inorganic acids (nitric and carbonic), were tested as desorbing agents to recover the used slag. Citric acid in sea water was found to be the best in terms of desorption efficiency and cost-effectiveness.The column tests were carried out to simulate the filtration bed in laboratory conditions. Stormwater samples were collected from residential and commercial areas in Auckland. The synthetic stormwater samples were prepared from clay and metallic ion solution. Both samples were used as feeding solutions in the tests. The removal efficiencies of suspended solids and metallic ions (Zn2+, Cd2+ and Cu2+) vary depending on different operation conditions. They are in inverse proportion to the grain size of the melter slag and the influent flow rate. The higher removal efficiency of Zn2+ than that of suspended solids infers that metallic ions are removed by both precipitation and adsorption.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water - Pollution</field><field name="subject">Water - Purification - Adsorption</field><field name="subject">Water - Purification - Filtration</field><field name="subject">Runoff</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">One war, two different perspectives : identifying the main news sources in the coverage of the 2003 war in Iraq by Al-Jazeera and CNN</field><field name="creator">Saraj, Amel Hussein</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to identify the main sources of news in the coverage of the 2003 war in Iraq by the Arab channel Al-Jazeera and CNN. It distinguishes the news sources that journalists of CNN and Al-Jazeera have depended on while covering or reporting the events of the war and examines why they gave more airtime to certain news sources than others. Content analysis is used as the main research method and the Glasgow University Media Group's work is adopted as a model. The data for the research is five prime time news hours chosen from five-day intervals during the war from the coverage by both channels.This study also examines the two channels' different perspectives towards the event. This takes into account their histories, their stated position regarding their role and their editorial practices. At the same time there will be an attempt to further contextualize this issue by looking at the flow of the world news across borders, the development of Arab media before and after the emergence of satellite broadcasting and by briefly reviewing the history of Western media war reportage.The thesis concludes that the main sources on CNN were the 'coalition' military and official sources. By contrast, Al-Jazeera's coverage gave almost equal time to other perspectives such as anti-war voices and 'independent' analysts. Consequently it is argued that Al-Jazeera's coverage was more balanced and multiperspectival.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Al Jazeera (Television network)</field><field name="subject">Cable News Network</field><field name="subject">Iraq War, 2003</field><field name="subject">Mass media</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of seedling recruitment under manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) plantings at Shakespear and Wenderholm regional parks</field><field name="creator">Quadling, Diane Patricia</field><field name="description">Exclosure plots were monitored to investigate the impact of browsing on seedling recruitment by Trichosurus vulpecula, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Rattus rattus on seedlings under Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides plantings in two Auckland Regional Council Parks (ARC), Shakespear and Wenderholm. The number of woody seedlings that established over a 17-month period was recorded. Gaps within the same Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy were created to investigate the influence of the canopy on seedling recruitment. Soil samples were taken to investigate the existing seed bank beneath the same Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopies.At Wenderholm, net change in seedling density differed among treatments (P=0.014). Seedling density increased within the plots that excluded Trichosurus vulpecula and Oryctolagus cuniculus and within plots that additionally excluded Rattus rattus, but declined in the control plots. In contrast at Shakespear, although seedling density increased more within both the exclosure plots than in the control plots, this result was not statistically significant (P=0.728). At Wenderholm, the average seedling height increased within both types of exclosure plots, but declined in the control plots. However, these differences among treatments were not statistically significant (P=0.204). At Shakespear, seedlings increased in height within the Trichosurus vulpecula, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Rattus rattus exclosures and declined marginally in the other two treatments. Again, differences in height change among treatments were not statistically significant (P=0.202).At both regional parks, the greatest cause of mortality within the exclosures excluding Trichosurus vulpecula and Oryctolagus cuniculus was desiccation. All of the mortalities within the Trichosurus vulpecula, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Rattus rattus exclosures was unidentifiable. However, within the control plots, at Wenderholm, the greatest identified cause of mortality was browsing and at Shakespear, the only cause of mortality within the control plots was browsing.Seedbanks at Wenderholm and Shakespear under the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides plantings were dominated by forb species. A total of 1308 seedlings germinated from soil taken from Wenderholm, with exotic species making up 99.4% of germinations, with exotic species making up 97.9% of germinations. Similarly a total of 801 seedlings germinated from soil samples taken from Shakespear.At Wenderholm, the number of native seedling germinations within the gaps created in the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy, was more than twice the number that germinated under the closed canopy. However, this difference was marginally non-significant (P=0.065). At Shakespear, the number of native seedling germinations within gaps created in the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy was similar to the number that germinated under the closed canopy (P=0.2603).The results suggest that at Wenderholm, despite ongoing predator control, Trichosurus vulpecula and/or Oryctolagus cuniculus have had an adverse effect on the survival and growth of seedlings. The results also suggest that at Shakespear, Rattus rattus have had an adverse effect on the survival and growth of seedlings under the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy. The distance from mature forest may also have had an impact on the dispersal of native seeds within the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy. The implication of these results for the future management of restoration plantings in regional parks is discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seedling regeneration</field><field name="subject">Seed bank</field><field name="subject">Revegetation</field><field name="subject">Auckland Regional Council</field><field name="subject">Regional parks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change, teacher education, and management in a Hong Kong university</field><field name="creator">Heuring, Christine</field><field name="description">The thesis of this research paper is clarifying the relationship between educational change, teacher education and management at the tertiary level in a local university immediately after the handover of Hong Kong to the People?s Republic of China. The purpose is to describe the research process, to present data, and to draw conclusions. Chapter 1 describes the structure of the paper and introduces two theoretical issues which arise in the data and are referred to in the literature (commodification and collectionism) but are not the focus of this study. Nevertheless, they seem to explain some important relationships between these three themes and are referred to in the conclusion. Chapter 2 presents recent references to literature from around the world related to the three themes. The review highlights the weakness that few references describe the practical implementation of a theoretical management approach to effecting educational change through teacher education. Chapter 3 describes in detail the successful application of the management approach of the learning organisation, the practical implementation of an educational change, and the resultant teacher education within the alternative programme section of the university department studied. Chapter 4 covers the methodological process of the data collection for this research. The data collection is comprised of: 1) a questionnaire about teacher education activities; 2) a lengthy interview with each of thirty academic staff, the Head of Department, and a Vice-President; 3) supporting documents; and, 4) my observations as participant-observer. Chapter 5 presents the findings and discussion. They are analysed in an overall manner and then re-analysed between two groups of staff. One group is part of the teacher education described in Chapter 3; the other group is the remainder of the staff who had not been part of that teacher education. The findings of the questionnaires, the interviews, and the supporting documents indicate that differences in attitude toward teacher education exist between staff who has been exposed to different teacher education management approaches. These findings also show that staff who have been affected and staff who have been unaffected by the learning organisation approach to staff development note differences in management approach. Both staff and appraisers evaluate the learning organisation management approach used in the alternative programme section of the department very positively. Chapter 6 ends with conclusions, links back to the literature, and suggestions. The conclusions show that the educational change found in this research is similar to the change listed in the literature. The shortcomings and issues of teacher education in this research are similar to those revealed in the literature. The conclusions also support the importance of management approach and its relationship to effective teacher education. It ends with a summary of the positive results of using a learning organisation management approach in teacher education at this site. The final chapter also refers back to commodification and collectionism noted in the introduction and suggests that they should also be considered by teachers, managers and researchers in further work on teacher education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Higher</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">Teacher education</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24943</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of the resource reservation protocol using coloured petri nets</field><field name="creator">Villapol, Maria</field><field name="description">The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is one of the proposals of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for conveying Quality of Service (QoS) related information in the form of resource reservations along the communication path. The RSVP specification (i.e. Request for Comments 2205) provides a narrative description of the protocol without any use of formal techniques. Thus, some parts of the document may be ambiguous, difficult to understand, and imprecise. So far, RSVP implementations have provided the only mechanism for validating. The cost for fixing errors in the protocol found in the implementation can be high. These disadvantages together with the fact that RSVP is complex make it a good target for formal specification and verification. This thesis formally defines the RSVP Service Specification, models RSVP using a formal method known as Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) and attempts to verify the model. The following steps summarise the verification process of RSVP. Firstly, the RSVP service specification is derived from the protocol description and modelled using CPNs. After validating the model, the service language, which defines all the possible service primitive occurrence sequences, is generated from the state space of the model by using automata reduction techniques that preserve sequences. Secondly, RSVP is modelled using CPNs. The model is analysed for a set of behavioural properties. They include general properties of protocols, such as correct termination, and a set of new properties defined in this thesis, which are particular to RSVP. The analysis is based on the state space method. The properties are checked by querying the state graph and checking reachability among multiple nodes of its associated Strongly Connected Component (SCC) graph. As a first step, we analyse RSVP under the assumption of a perfect medium (no loss or duplication) to ensure that protocol errors are not hidden by rare events of the medium. The state space is reduced to obtain the sequences of service primitives allowed by RSVP known as the protocol language. Then, the protocol language is compared with the service language to determine if they are equivalent. The desired properties of RSVP are proved to be satisfied by the RSVP CPN model, so that the features of RSVP included in the CPN model operate as expected under our modelling and analysis assumptions. Also, the language analysis results show that RSVP service primitive occurrence sequences generated by the RSVP model are included in the proposed model of the service specification. However, some service primitive occurrence sequences generated from the service specification model are not in the protocol language. These sequences were analysed. There is strong evidence to suggest that these sequences would also appear in the protocol if the capacity of the medium in the RSVP model was marginally increased. Unfortunately, the standard reachability analysis tools would not handle this case, due to state space explosion.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Petri nets</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Electronic data processing</field><field name="subject">Distributed processing</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24944</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating spirituality, occupation, and mental illness a journey through life of meaningful being and doing</field><field name="creator">Wilding, Clare</field><field name="description">The aim of this qualitative research project was to investigate the phenomenon of spirituality within occupation as encountered by six people who have all experienced mental illness. A Heideggerian phenomenological philosophy was utilised as the theoretical background. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews with each participant, which were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a hermeneutic, circular process. Eight themes arose from the investigation. Firstly, the experience of spirituality is diverse and each person has his or her idiosyncratic understanding of what spirituality is. Secondly, spirituality is experienced as a journey that changes across time. The third theme notes that spirituality is vitally important to the study participants, so much so, that participants??? spirituality saved them from suicide and filled their lives with meaning and purpose. The fourth theme is recognition that there are ???spiritual occupations??? that are designed to directly access one???s spirituality. Fifth is that spirituality is a form of being which provides the meaning to purposeful doing and that therefore spirituality can make even ???ordinary??? occupation spiritually meaningful. Theme six is that spirituality is not only important on an individual level, but that social and community dimensions of spirituality are also essential. Theme seven finds that mental illness provided the ???wake-up message??? that ???called??? each participant to a spiritual life. The final theme is that spirituality helps the participants cope with living with mental illness. The thesis concludes that spirituality is an indispensable part of each participant???s life. Spirituality has both irrevocably changed participants??? lives and allowed them find personal meaning in their lives that is life-sustaining and life-enhancing. The findings also reveal that spirituality can be related to occupation both theoretically and practically. Given that spirituality was found to be life-saving and life-sustaining and that it can be conceptualised as an essential dimension of occupation, it is argued that spirituality is an issue of high importance to occupational therapists. However, since some occupational therapists may not feel comfortable or knowledgeable enough to discuss spirituality in practice (Collins, Paul and West-Frasier 2001; McColl 2000) it is noted that this topic area forms an emergent frontier for occupational therapy.

In demonstrating that reality eludes traditional conceptions of representation, physics is instituting a reappraisal of our conceptions of how we describe the Universe.  Overturning established notions of reality founded on a Cartesian doctrine of objectivity, quantum physics is said to prefigure postmodern metaphysics, effecting a convergence of contemporary thought in which the key themes are ?indeterminacy?, ?uncertainty?, and ?unknowability.?  Having reached its empirical limits, physics presents us with the limits of our power to represent the world.    Current physics is encountering its own ?event horizon? of knowledge which suggests that access to the real may be forever denied.  Post-empirical physics in speculative mode is said to be undifferentiable from philosophy and aesthetics.  Dominated by references to the unattainable and the unknowable, theories of everything dissolve the distinction between invention and discovery at the quantum scale and between the natural and the supernatural at the cosmological level.  Trading in issues of limits and limitlessness, theoretical physics is operating at the extremes of metaphysical inquiry, disclosing themes of unity and fragmentation which revive tensions between the whole and the parts that have historically preoccupied all philosophical inquiry.    This thesis argues that the representational problems encountered by physics can be more effectively mounted in aesthetic terms.  Specifically, twentieth century physics embodies an implicit and unacknowledged aesthetic of the sublime within its discourse.  The combination of the rational and the mystical, of science and metaphysics, of explanation and speculation which characterises contemporary physics offers partial presentations of a totality which, as a totality, is unpresentable.  Dealing in entities and concepts which defy the imagination, physics attempts to encompass a whole which we are unable to comprehend as a whole at the level of the senses but which we can comprehend as an Idea of reason, thus enabling us to experience the sublime.  The problem of articulation is now intrinsic to any scientific view of reality and the requirement for physicists to forego their ?customary demands for a visualisable description of nature? necessitates strategies by which to present the unpresentable.  In occasioning imaginative representations which strive after something which lies beyond the bounds of experience, descriptions of the quantum realm disclose an aesthetic appraisal of the sublimity of nature which revives the Romanticist link between nature and aesthetics first established by Kant in the Critique of Judgement.  Thus, physics can be located within the framework of the Kantian sublime.    Adopting a theoretical approach grounded in hermeneutics, I extend the discussion of the sublime from its usual preoccupation with the visual arts to argue that the encounter with the unpresentable in physics is enforcing a shift to the poetic within the discourse analogous to the transition from representation to poiesis in Romantic aesthetics.  Mystical interpretations of quantum mechanics, in particular, connect with the aesthetics of transcendence wherein natural science intersects with religion through the aesthetic perception of the infinite in the finite.  In identifying knowledge of nature with the Absolute the discourse of physics is characterised by themes of ekstasis and transcendence which I conclude disclose a moral imperative which is embodied in the aesthetic judgement of the sublime.  Hence, as a symbol of the mind?s relation to a transcendent order, physics, displacing art, enters the field opened up by the aesthetics of the sublime.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art and science</field><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The discursive representation of international undergraduate students a case study of a higher education institutional site</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Margaret Kamla Wati Singh</field><field name="description">This dissertation addresses the discursive representation of international undergraduate students from the areas of South East Asia and Africa.

The process of community consultation and participation was seen as particularly important in this context, so was examined in depth. The Design Practice Methodology developed by Fifth Creek Studio, who specialise in landscape architecture, public art and urban design, was combined with Action Research, Heuristics and other methodologies to form the basis of the thesis methodology. This was supported by oral histories, interviews and a questionnaire with case study participants.

Mucosal growth, observed by increasing villus area and crypt length, is upregulated during weaning, compared to pre or post-weaned time frames. The dynamics of organ growth, mediated by the process of crypt fission, is unknown during this period of postnatal development. Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF) and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) are mesenchymally derived ligands which have been demonstrated to have trophic effects on the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract in vitro and in vivo during embryonic development, repair/restitution and tumour progression. This study explores the hypothesis that small intestine organ growth occurs independently to that of mucosal growth and the mechanisms of growth are mediated by differential expression of either HGF or KGF within the pericryptal mesenchyme derived cells (fibroblasts). Alternatively, the corresponding receptors for these ligands, c-met and bek, may exhibit differential expression within the proliferative compartment of the crypts. The indices of mucosal and organ growth were compared at various ages during early postnatal life (suckling), then early, middle and late weaning through to adult animals. Microdissection techniques utilising whole tissue samples enabled microscopic evaluation of growth. The assessment of KGF, bek, HGF and c-met was also undertaken using immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin processed sections of rat jejunum. The highest rate of organ growth occurred during weaning and was immediately preceded at day 14 (of age) by a peak in the incidence of branching crypts. KGF immunolabelling was observed within the mesenchymal cells at the tips of the villus from mid-weaning onwards but at no stage within pericryptal fibroblasts. Both KGF and bek were demonstrated within the crypt epithelium, with highest levels observed during weaning. Immunolabelling for HGF demonstrated an ubiquitous distribution within both epithelial and mesenchymal tissues at all ages, whilst the expression of c-met was in the crypt cell compartment was limited to the time of weaning. The use of an in vivo blockade technique utilising an anti-HGF (D9) antibody from age 7 to 14 days did not demonstrate any reduction of the indices of organ or mucosal growth. These results suggest that rate of organ and mucosal growth increase concurrently during weaning. The demonstration of both bek and c-met in the crypt cell population during this period suggests that KGF and HGF are potential mediators of organ or mucosal growth, despite only HGF being demonstrated in the pericryptal mesenchymal derived cells. Further, the expression of KGF and HGF at sites beyond the crypts suggest these ligands play a greater role in the development of the rat small intestine during postnatal growth.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intestine, Small</field><field name="subject">Child development</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24990</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A knowledge-based approach to rapid system development of business information systems</field><field name="creator">Ho, Michael Moon Tong</field><field name="description">Business information systems have been targets for rapid application development because potential productivity gains can translate into huge returns on investment for organizations. However, to realize the perceived productivity improvement presents a major challenge to today?s information systems managers and requires new development approaches. End user computing is an approach to reduce the backlog of user requests for information needs through which end users are given the software tools to create their own reports and extract the information they need. Some end-users attempted to build their own information systems with fourth generation language (4GL) but failed partly due to the programming skills required of them. Although fourth generation languages have been promoted as a means to enhance programmer productivity by an order of magnitude more, later studies by researchers showed less dramatic results. The many problems and deficiencies of 4GL created obstacles to achieve spectacular improvement in productivity as promoted. A new knowledge-based approach to rapid business information systems development is attempted in this study to overcome the shortcomings of 4GL. A prototype system consisting of a knowledgebase is integrated with an object-oriented application generator to alleviate the need for conventional programming skills. Typical information system functionalities of database creation and updating are provided through a framework of reusable business information system components. These are object classes arranged and instantiated in a certain way directed by a specification language. The knowledgebase enables the translation of user requirements via the specification language that explicitly avoids the prerequisite programming skills required of the developer. The specification language is non-procedural in that specifications can be specified in any order. It does not follow the basic programming language constructs of sequence, decision and repetition. Additionally, the customizable rules allow the developer to validate the specifications before generating the desired application. Maintenance and enhancement of the generated application is modified by regenerating from the modified knowledge-based facts and rules, at a higher level than conventional programming languages or even 4GL. Experiments with small groups of end-users and developers found this approach to be viable. Although the specification process is tedious, no programming skills were ever required other than spreadsheet like expressions. The absence of programming logic prevents most of the errors caused by newly constructed information systems. Testing is still required, but the remedies are much easier. In conclusion, the study has demonstrated the feasibility of a knowledge-based approach to rapid system development of business information systems. This approach enables technical and end-user alike to rapidly develop such systems without programming. The application generator is built with reusable business information system components that can be added and extended to support more capabilities. The knowledgebase can be enhanced with corresponding new rules and facts to enable the user developer to build new functionalities into existing or new systems. Business information system development can be lifted to a higher-level than procedural specifications, and assisted by knowledge-based inference to achieve spectacular productivity improvements.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Computer network resources</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24991</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An operating system for reconfigurable computing</field><field name="creator">Wigley, Grant Brian</field><field name="description">Field programmable gate arrays are a class of integrated circuit that enable logic functions and interconnects to be programmed in almost real time. They can implement fine grained parallel computing architectures and algorithms in hardware that were previously the domain of custom VLSI. Field programmable gate arrays have shown themselves useful at exploiting concurrency in a range of applications such as text searching, image processing and encryption. When coupled with a microprocessor, which is more suited to computation involving complex control flow and non time critical requirements, they form a potentially versatile platform commonly known as a Reconfigurable Computer. Reconfigurable computing applications have traditionally had the exclusive use of the field programmable gate array, primarily because the logic densities of the available devices have been relatively similar in size compared to the application. But with the modern FPGA expanding beyond 10 million system gates, and through the use of dynamic reconfiguration, it has become feasible for several applications to share a single high density device. However, developing applications that share a device is difficult as the current design flow assumes the exclusive use of the FPGA resources. As a consequence, the designer must ensure that resources have been allocated for all possible combinations of loaded applications at design time. If the sequence of application loading and unloading is not known in advance, all resource allocation cannot be performed at design time because the availability of resources changes dynamically. The use of a runtime resource allocation environment modelled on a classical software operating system would allow the full benefits of dynamic reconfiguration on high density FPGAs to be realised. In addition to runtime resource allocation, other services provided by an operating system such as abstraction of I/O and inter-application communication would provide additional benefits to the users of a reconfigurable computer. This could possibly reduce the difficulty of application development and deployment. In this thesis, an operating system for reconfigurable computing that supports dynamically arriving applications is presented. This is achieved by firstly developing the abstractions with which designers implement their applications and a set of algorithm requirements that specify the resource allocation and logic partitioning services. By combining these, an architecture of an operating system for reconfigurable computing can be specified. A prototype implementation on one platform with multiple applications is then presented which enables an exploration of how the resource allocation algorithms interact amongst themselves and with typical applications. Results obtained from the prototype include the measurement of the performance loss in applications, and the time overheads introduced due to the use of the operating system. Comparisons are made with programmable logic applications run with and without the operating system. The results show that the overheads are reasonable given the current state of the technology of FPGAs. Formulas for predicting the user response time and application throughput based on the fragmentation of an FPGA are then derived. Weaknesses are highlighted in the current design flows and the architecture of current FPGAs must be rectified if an operating system is to become main-stream. For the tool flows this includes the ability to pre-place and pre-route cores and perform high speed runtime routing. For the FPGAs these include an optimised network, a memory management core, and a separate layer to handle dynamic routing of the network.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrated circuits</field><field name="subject">Gate array circuits</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24992</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ideals, myths and realities : a postmodern analysis of moral-ethical decision-making and professional ethics in social work practice</field><field name="creator">Asquith, Merrylyn</field><field name="description">This thesis critically analyses how social work practitioners construct moral-ethical decision-making in systems that are constituted as legal-rational authority and political-socioeconomic interests.

Taking a postmodern approach, the thesis argues that the concepts of 'the child' and 'childhood' are social constructs produced by discourses that have arisen from historical accounts of the position of children in 'adult' society. The knowledge thus produced constructs children as incomplete beings, vulnerable and unable to understand significant issues such as those associated with parental separation. Consequently, children are marginalised, 'othered' and denied the opportunity to participate in decisions that directly affect them. After reviewing the ways in which discourses operate to subjectify children in this way, the thesis explores an alternative construction of children as competent and resilient, able to participate with their adult counterparts in decision-making activities. The potential for the provisions of both the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Australian Family Law Reform Act 1995 to reconstruct children in this way is explored. Reviews of the literature indicated that Australian children had not been included in research and discussions about their involvement in decisions that directly affected them. Consequently, this research undertook in-depth interviews of sixteen children between the ages of 7 and 17 years. Their views about their abilities to participate in decisions that directly affect them are reviewed in relation to the different discourses identified in the literature. The extent to which children?s understandings reflect these discourses is considered. The thesis argues that much is still to be achieved. A review of the findings includes an account of the difficulties experienced in recruiting children for this project and suggests that the social construction of children continues to position them as vulnerable and incompetent. It is argued that the constructs of 'competence', 'age' and 'maturity' are not useful indicators of children's abilities to make decisions; thus, a 'new' construction of children, based on greater adult understanding of their unique experiences and understandings, is suggested. In relation to decisions that affect children following parental separation, the thesis makes a number of suggestions that support an exploration of creative initiatives that reflect the children's views.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family law</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Children's rights</field><field name="subject">Parent and child (Law)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24966</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raising ghosts post-World War Two European emigre and migrant artists and the evolution of abstract painting in Australia, with special reference to Adelaide ca 1950-1965</field><field name="creator">Dutkiewicz, Adam</field><field name="description">Raising ghosts examines the political and cultural climate in Australia in the mid-20th century, and proposes that e?migre? and migrant artists to a significant extent were the catalysts of change and progenitors of new forms of painting in the post-war years.

Consequences to inpatient aggression are profound, impacting on staff and patients, ward milieu and regime, and mental health services in general. Despite considerable research, which has primarily focussed on the assessment of demographic and clinical characteristics of aggressive patients, the nature of the relationship between mental illness, inpatient treatment and aggression remains unclear. Inconsistent risk assessment practices, management strategies and treatment plans, often derived from idiosyncratic beliefs about the causes of aggression, follow. Approaches to the assessment of inpatient aggression have been categorised as structural, which emphasise form, or functional, which emphasise purpose. Studies of inpatient aggression have primarily utilized a structural approach. These studies have resulted in the identification of demographic, clinical and situational characteristics of high-risk patients and environments. Resource allocation and actuarial assessments of risk have been assisted by this research. Conversely, functional assessment approaches seek to clarify the factors responsible for the development, expression and maintenance of inpatient aggression by examining predisposing characteristics, in addition to the proximal antecedents and consequences of aggressive behaviours. While functional analysis has demonstrated efficacy in assessing and prescribing interventions for other problem behaviours, and has been regarded a legitimate assessment approach for anger management problems, psychiatric inpatient aggression has been relatively neglected by functional analysis. Against this background, four studies focussing on the assessment of predisposing characteristics, precipitants and consequences, and purposes of aggressive behaviour, were undertaken to assist in the development of a functional analysis of psychiatric inpatient aggression. All four studies were conducted within the Thomas Embling Hospital (TEH), a secure forensic psychiatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The first of three initial studies involved a retrospective review of Incident Forms relating to aggressive behaviours that occurred within the first year of the hospital?s operation. The second involved a comparison of prospective assessment of aggressive behaviours with retrospective review of Incident Forms. The third involved a review of Incident Forms across two forensic psychiatric hospitals, the Rosanna Forensic Psychiatric Centre, and the TEH, to allow for the study of environmental contributors to aggression. The fourth, and main study, focussed on the assessment of patients and aggressive incidents, using a framework emphasising purpose, which was assessed using a classification system designed and validated as part of this study. Demographic and clinical information in addition to social behaviour, history of aggression and substance use were collected on the 204 patients admitted to the hospital during 2002. One hundred and ten of these patients completed an additional assessment of psychotic symptoms in addition to a battery of psychological tests measuring anger expression and control, assertiveness, and impulsivity. During 2002, the year under review, there were 502 incidents of verbal aggression, physical aggression, and property damage recorded. Staff members who observed these incidents were interviewed, and files were reviewed to record the severity, type, direction and purpose of aggression. Following 71 aggressive behaviours patients also participated in the assessment of purpose. Results from this, and the three initial studies, reinforced the contribution to aggression of a number of individual characteristics, including a recent history of substance use, an entrenched history of aggression, a recent history of antisocial behaviour, and symptoms of psychosis, including thought disturbance, auditory hallucinations and conceptual disorganisation. Somewhat surprisingly, a number of other characteristics shown through previous research to have a relationship with aggression, including anger arousal and control, impulsivity, and assertiveness did not show a relationship with aggression. Further, and perhaps a consequence of the peculiar characteristics of some patients admitted to the TEH, older patients and females were more likely to be repeatedly aggressive, yet neither age nor gender differentiated aggressive from non-aggressive inpatients. In this study acts of inpatient aggression were usually precipitated by discernible events, or motivated by rational purposes. Rarely was aggression the consequence of a spontaneous manifestation of underlying psychopathology occurring in isolation from environmental precipitants. A number of proximal environmental factors, most particularly staff-patient interactions associated with treatment or maintenance of ward regime, that were considered provocative or that threatened status, were evident in incidents of aggression perpetrated against staff. The perception of provocation and the need to enhance status were common precipitants of aggression between patients. There was little evidence to suggest that aggression was used instrumentally to obtain tangible items, to reduce social isolation, or to observe the suffering of others in the absence of provocation. Results of these four studies have implications for the prediction and prevention of inpatient aggression, and for the treatment of aggressive inpatients. These are discussed, as are the limitations of this research and suggestions for further research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health personnel and patient</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Violence in hospitals</field><field name="subject">Medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Violence against</field><field name="subject">Aggressiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24968</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal energy management for solar-powered cars</field><field name="creator">Pudney, Peter</field><field name="description">Solar powered cars may never be practical. Nevertheless, in the 1996 World Solar Challenge the Honda Dream carried two people 3000km across Australia at an average speed of 90km/h, powered only by sunlight. You clearly don?t need a 2500kg machine powered by polluting fuels to get you to work and back each day. The Australian Aurora 101 solar powered car requires less than 2000W of power to travel at 100km/h. To achieve such high performance the car has high aerodynamic efficiency, motor efficiency greater than 98%, low rolling resistance tyres, and weighs less than 280kg with the driver in it. The energy used to propel the car is generated by high-efficiency photovoltaic cells Another key to achieving high performance is efficient energy management. The car has a small battery that can store enough energy to drive the car about 250km at 100km/h. Energy stored in the battery can be used when extra power is required for climbing hills or for driving under clouds. More importantly, energy stored while the car is not racing can be used to increase the average speed of the car. How should the battery be used? The motivation for this problem was to develop an energy management strategy for the Aurora solar racing team to use in the World Solar Challenge, a triennial race across Australia from Darwin to Adelaide. The real problem? with weather prediction, detailed models of the car and numerous race constraints?is intractable. But by studying several simplified problems it is possible to discover simple rules for an efficient energy management strategy. The simplest problem is to find a strategy that minimises the energy required to drive a car with a perfectly efficient battery and a constant drive efficiency. The optimal strategy is to drive at a constant speed. This is just the beginning of the solar car problem, however. More general problems, with more general models for the battery, drive system and solar power, can be formulated as optimal control problems, where the control is (usually) the flow of power from or to the battery. By forming a Hamiltonian function we can use Pontryagin?s Maximum Principle to derive necessary conditions for an optimal strategy. We then use these conditions to construct an optimal strategy. The strategies for the various simplified problems are similar: ? On a level road, with solar power a known function of time, and with a perfectly efficient drive system and battery, the optimal strategy has three driving modes: maximum power, speed holding, and maximum regenerative braking. ? If the perfectly efficient battery is replaced by a battery with constant energy efficiency then the single holding speed is replaced by two critical speeds. The lower speed is held when solar power is low, and the upper speed is held when solar power is high. The battery discharges at the lower speed and charges at the higher speed. The difference between the upper and lower critical speeds is about 10km/h. There are precise conditions for switching from one mode to another, but small switching errors do not have a significant effect on the journey. ? If we now change from a level road to an undulating road, the optimal strategy still has two critical speeds. With hills, however, the conditions for switching between driving modes are more complex. Steep gradients must be anticipated. For steep inclines the control should be switched to power before the incline so that speed increases before the incline and drops while the car is on the incline. Similarly, for steep declines the speed of the car should be allowed to drop before the decline and increase on the decline. ? With more realistic battery models the optimal control is continuous rather than discrete. The optimal strategy is found by following an optimal trajectory in the phase space of the state and adjoint equations. This optimal trajectory is very close to a critical point of the phase space for most of the journey. Speed increases slightly with solar power. As before, the optimal speed lies within a narrow range for most of the journey. ? Power losses in the drive system affect the initial power phase, the final regenerative braking phase, and the speed profile over hills. The optimal speed still lies within a narrow range for most of the journey. ? With spatial variations in solar power it is possible to vary the speed of the car in such a way that the extra energy collected more than compensates for the extra energy used. Speed should be increased under clouds, and decreased in bright sunlight. The benefits of ?sun-chasing? are small, however. ? Solar power is not known in advance. By modelling solar power as a Markov process we can use dynamic programming to determine the target distance for each remaining day of the race. Alternatively, we can calculate the probability of completing the race at any given speed. These principles of efficient control have been used successfully since 1993 to develop practical strategy calculations for the Aurora solar racing team, winner of the 1999 World Solar Challenge.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar engines</field><field name="subject">Solar cars</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24969</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bounds and algorithms for carrier frequency and phase estimation</field><field name="creator">Rice, Feng</field><field name="description">Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is a highly bandwidth efficient transmission technique for digital communications.

I establish how a different way of theorising &#226;&#8364;&#732;pain&#226;&#8364;&#8482; can assist in exploring how nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; subjectivity is constituted. I seek to open up possibilities for challenge and resistance by nurses to the dominant practices that influence how actions of nurses in relation to pain, come to exist. In challenging taken-for-granted representations of how pain is understood, I do not discount representations reported in literature, or as stated by people considered, for example, pain &#226;&#8364;&#732;experts&#226;&#8364;&#8482;. Rather, I challenge how, these representations of pain and pain expertise, have come to exist as self-present truth, and seek to explore what other representations are marginalised as a consequence. I am aware that the interpretations of representations that I forward are open to this same critique. For my exploration of nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; actions related to pain for people having elective surgery, I undertook a poststructural analysis, informed by the works of Derrida, and Foucault. In particular, I constituted my thesis, in Derrida&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s dictum &#226;&#8364;&#732;we are written as we write&#226;&#8364;&#8482;, and Foucault&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s analysis of three intersected topics: power, truth and the formation of selves. I analysed literature related to pain and management of that pain as text, and employed ethnographic techniques of observation, interviews and collection of documentary materials, to analyse nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; actions as text. I attempt to present a new text of nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; actions related to pain. I challenge the view that there is an essential true meaning that resides in pain, literature related to pain, or nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; actions aligned to that pain. Analysing how nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; subjectivity is written, in relation to pain, provides to nurses a means to read and write nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; actions in different ways. I reveal how a specific way of writing nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; actions, articulates a particular version of truth about pain, and how nurses are then positioned within this version of truth, and in turn, how nurses position people constituted as patients. I explore how, organisation as structure, is a way of thinking that continues to make invisible the power and politics dynamic in nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; actions related to pain. If the word &#226;&#8364;&#732;pain&#226;&#8364;&#8482; is taken as understood by nurses, that is, it is known what &#226;&#8364;&#732;pain&#226;&#8364;&#8482; means, this way of thinking will continue to privilege one meaning of pain in the hospital, and, maintain a traditional perspective of &#226;&#8364;&#732;organisation as structure&#226;&#8364;&#8482;. In opening out alternate understandings of pain, and readings of nurses&#226;&#8364;&#8482; actions, the study allows for the possibility that pain, and the way that nurses act in relation to that pain, may indeed mean different things to different people.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nurse and patient</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circadian disruption and adaptation associated with night work and transmeridian flight</field><field name="creator">Roach, Gregory D</field><field name="description">Shiftwork, particularly that involving night work and/or transmeridian flight, forces a mismatch between the sleep/wake cycle and the endogenous circadian timing system.  Specifically, shiftworkers are often required to sleep at a phase in the circadian cycle when they would usually be active, and to work at a phase in the circadian cycle when they would usually be asleep.  The current thesis describes a series of five studies designed to examine the disruption and adaptation associated with shiftwork, with an emphasis on night work and, to a lesser extent, transmeridian flight.    The first study (Chapter 3), conducted in the field, was designed to examine the effects of break duration and time of break onset on the amount of sleep that shiftworkers obtain between consecutive work periods, and to consider the role that pineal production of melatonin may play in this process, through its regulation of sleep.  Not surprisingly, total sleep time (TST) increased with break duration for breaks that began at similar times of day.  Importantly though, TST was greater for breaks that occurred during the night-time than for breaks that occurred during the daytime.  These results indicated that the minimum-length break requirements contained in prescriptive duty hours regulations might not necessarily protect shiftworkers from being exposed to unacceptable levels of fatigue.  In addition, there was a temporal relationship between the circadian rhythms of sleep duration, sleep quality, and 6-sulphatoxymelatonin excretion, such that sleep was longer and of better quality when melatonin production was relatively high.  This data did not prove a causal link, but it did provide further indication that melatonin may be involved in the regulation of sleep.    The aim of the second study (Chapter 4) was to examine the effects of time of day, shift duration, and prior sleep length on self-assessed alertness and neurobehavioural performance of shiftworkers in a real work setting.  Cosinor regression models fitted to the data indicated that time of day had a significant effect on alertness and performance, with both reaching nadirs in the early morning.  Indeed, the cosinor regression lines of best fit explained more than 90% of the within-subjects variability in both the alertness and performance measures.  In addition, alertness declined as shift duration increased and rose as prior sleep length increased, and there was a decline in performance across work periods that was greater for extended shifts.  However, the results indicated that time of day was the most important determinant of subjective alertness and neurobehavioural performance.  Consequently, the fatigue associated with night work can never be eliminated, only minimised through the application of risk management strategies.    The aim of the third study (Chapter 5) was to quantify the effects of fatigue on performance in a simulated work environment, i.e. a rail simulator, and to compare them with the effects of alcohol intoxication.  Reaction time (RT) performance on a visual psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) was also assessed.  Rather than cause a general decline in performance as was hypothesised, fatigue impaired some safety and efficiency measures (i.e. number and duration of extreme speed violations increased, average speed reduced, brake use increased), but not others (i.e. fuel use, inter-train forces, and minor and moderate speed violations were unaffected).  The reduction in safety and consequent increase in risk due to fatigue reached levels equivalent to those associated with moderate levels of alcohol intoxication (i.e. -05?-10%).  The results indicated that fatigue caused participants to disengage from operating the simulator such that safety was traded off, not necessarily deliberately, against some aspects of efficiency.  RT performance on the PVT was also significantly impaired by fatigue, similar to the magnitude of impairment associated with moderate levels of alcohol intoxication (i.e. -05?-10%).  However, the PVT results could not predict the complex relationship between simulator safety and efficiency measures.  This indicated that the effects of fatigue on performance in the workplace cannot necessarily be derived on the basis of simple performance measures such as RT.    The fourth study (Chapter 6), conducted in the laboratory, was designed to assess adaptation to a simulated night work schedule using salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) as the circadian phase marker.  Participants worked seven consecutive simulated 8-hour night shifts (i.e. 23:00?07:00h).  This resulted in a mean total phase delay in DLMO of 5.5 hours, equivalent to an average delay of 0.8 hours per day.  In addition, baseline DLMO was significantly correlated with mean wake time over the previous seven days.  These results indicated that partial circadian adaptation occurred in response to the simulated night work schedule, and that baseline DLMO was reliably predicted by the mean wake up time for the preceding week.  The radioimmunoassay used proved to be a sensitive measure of melatonin concentration in saliva for the determination of DLMO, and thus provides an alternative phase marker to core body temperature.    The last study (Chapter 7) was designed to examine the adaptation of a RAAF aircrew to several small time zone transitions using salivary melatonin onset as the marker of circadian phase.  In addition, the effects of the aircrew?s work schedule on their sleep/wake patterns and subjective alertness were assessed.  During the first six days of a routine surveillance patrol (SURPAT), the aircrew travelled eastward and melatonin onset occurred progressively earlier (i.e. phase advanced).  During the second six days of the SURPAT, the aircrew travelled westward but melatonin onset did not significantly shift.  Night-time sleep duration was shorter prior to work days than prior to rest days, and subjective alertness was not significantly affected by either the duration of night-time sleep prior to work, or the duration of flight.  The melatonin onset results indicated that participants? body clocks adapted well to several small time zone transitions when initially travelling eastward, but did not adapt to a similar pattern of time zone transitions when subsequently travelling westward.  This was contrary to expectations based on studies of single acute time zone transitions, which indicate that adaptation to westward flight is more rapid than adaptation to eastward flight.    Taken together, the results of these five studies confirm that shiftwork provides a considerable source of disruption to shiftworkers? sleep/wake patterns.  Whilst this disruption to shiftworkers? sleep may impair subjective alertness, the greatest influence on alertness and performance is exerted by time of day.  Furthermore, the combined effects of sleep disruption and time of day may result in a level of performance impairment in a simulated work environment similar to that associated with moderate levels of alcohol intoxication.  Finally, night work and transmeridian flight provide a source of circadian disruption, the adaptation to which can be assessed in both laboratory and field settings by examining changes in the timing of nocturnal melatonin onset.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Circadian rhythms</field><field name="subject">Sleep-wake cycle</field><field name="subject">Light</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Shift systems</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flight crew fatigue in Australian short-haul operations and methodologies for assessing fatigue in-flight</field><field name="creator">Loh, Sylvia</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is fatigue in aviation. It presents a detailed analysis of subjective fatigue and sleep patterns in short-haul operations. This operation was chosen because short-haul rosters encompass a range of scheduling factors that have been identified in the shiftwork literature as having a negative impact on alertness and performance. It is contended that studies examining these factors in the commercial aviation industry are scarce, and of those available, limited to investigations conducted outside of Australia. In addition, this thesis addresses a methodological limitation that has, to date, restricted the ability to measure fatigue during flight. It is contended that the scarcity of in-flight studies stems from the lack of a suitable performance test for measuring fatigue in time-constrained operating environments, such as aviation. The studies presented in this thesis are divided into two sections. The first section comprises three aviation studies conducted in Qantas airlines. The first two aviation studies examined the effects of scheduling factors on the subjective fatigue of flight crew employed by Qantas airlines. Two different populations were examined: B767 and B737 flight crew. Participants rated their fatigue and recorded information about their flying patterns for a minimum of 15 days. The results indicated that flight crew experienced mild to moderate fatigue in relation to their work. Importantly, different scheduling factors contributed to fatigue, including length of the flight duty period, number of flying hours, and duty start times. The third aviation study examined the sleep of B737 flight crew across a 3-day schedule. Sleep quantity and quality were determined from a sleep diary and wrist actigraphy data. The results indicated that sleep offset time, sleep duration, and sleep quality significantly varied across the schedule. In addition, early morning start times and late evening end times were key factors contributing to reduced sleep. The second section of this thesis comprises two laboratory studies that assessed the sensitivity of a brief (i.e. less than 10 minutes) psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) to the effects of sleep loss. A preliminary study compared performance during the 10-minute PVT with performance during the first half of the PVT during a night of wakefulness (23:00 ? 07:00 hours). A subsequent study compared performance during a 10-minute PVT with performance during a 90-second PVT and a 5-minute PVT during 28 hours of sustained wakefulness. The findings of the latter study indicated that performance during the 5-minute PVT and the 90-second PVT deteriorated in a manner similar to that observed during the standard 10-minute PVT. However, in line with the findings reported in the preliminary study, the shorter the task sampling time, the less sensitive the test to response slowing and performance variability. Based on these findings, it was surmised that a 5-minute PVT is likely to provide a more accurate measure of performance impairment than a test of shorter duration. Moreover, it was proposed that a 5-minute PVT may provide researchers with a reliable test for assessing changes in performance. In summary, the results of the aviation studies indicate that a number of scheduling factors contribute to fatigue and disturbed sleep in Australian domestic operations. The findings of this thesis are of particular concern, given that current aviation regulations do not fully consider the extent to which scheduling demands affect flight crew. It is apparent that flight crew would benefit from the incorporation of such findings into duty and rest limitations and scheduling procedures. Evidence demonstrating that (1) fatigue accumulates across the flight duty period, and (2) flight crew are at particular risk of higher fatigue when they are rostered to work an early morning duty suggests that the length of the flight duty period, the number of sectors worked and the timing of the duty period warrant particular attention. Finally, the results of the laboratory studies hold particular promise for future research, since they suggest that the 5-minute PVT may provide researchers with an alternative tool for investigating fatigue in the flying environment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aeronautics</field><field name="subject">Human factors</field><field name="subject">Air pilots</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Flight crews</field><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24975</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of acid rock drainage prediction methodologies for coal mine wastes</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Warwick</field><field name="description">Acid rock drainage (ARD) is recognised as one of the most serious environmental issues currently facing the mining industry.

There has been little exploration in the adult learning literature on the ways women might learn to live with breast cancer in the context of a heightened sense of mortality. Current institutional health education programs do not address the particular needs of individual women for practical and emotional support. In addition, the perspectives, resources, and knowledge of breast cancer self-help groups are not included in the literature on living with breast cancer. This study portrays survivor voices through the use of in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and document analysis. I use perspectives from feminist poststructuralism and Foucauldian discourse theory to explore the ways that the sixty-one women attending four breast cancer self-help groups in the late 1990s in urban and rural areas of Nova Scotia, Canada, learn to survive ? that is live with, through, and beyond ? breast cancer. While there was some variance in socioeconomic status and ethnicity, the participants were largely financially secure, married with children, of European descent, and between the ages of 33 and 83. This research shows that in their quest for survival, survivors moved amongst four overlapping discursive locations - the breast cancer self-help group, the family, the public sphere, and the cancer-care system with both support and conflict. Group discourses of reciprocity, self-care, temporality, and hope produce a range of discursive strategies for generating active survivor subjectivities. Through storytelling and the use of a powerful group technology, the survivor gaze, group members deconstruct the power technologies that disempower them. The analysis shows that survivors are active and resourceful in creating resistant, innovative, life-affirming, and self-respecting ways to speak themselves into social texts as authoritative and legitimate knowers, doers, and learners, producing new knowledge, resources, and truths about surviving. However, it is a major challenge for survivors to cope with the tense and contradictory effects of pervasive power and gender relations on the modes of subjectivities open to them. While masking of the postmastectomy body indicates that women are working on gendered identities, survivors are also learning to live their bodies in flux, taking up performative, cyborgian, productive, and playful bodies that challenge male-imposed definitions of what it is to be a woman, insisting on their right to define themselves. This thesis challenges the assumption that subjects must submit to the knowledge of experts in order to know, invent, and care for themselves. The research corroborates important insights from the self-help literature that self-help groups are significant social movements producing knowledgeable political subjects able to exercise power over their own lives. There is ample evidence that the expression and validation of emotions are central to knowledge construction processes. Further research is needed to examine how the knowledge produced by self-help groups can become officially recognized and utilized resources for survivors, and for those who care for and about them.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24977</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">We just do things a little differently here : a critical analysis of visual arts exchange between Malaysia and Australia from 1983 to 2001</field><field name="creator">Stacey, Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis critically analyses visual arts exchange between Australia and Malaysia from 1983 to 2001. In the last decade Australia's arts community has shown increased interest in contemporary Asian art. However there is little evidence of specific interest in Malaysian visual arts practice, despite strong associations between the two countries over many decades. Relations between Malaysia and Australia are problematised by complex political, cultural and religious factors, particularly evident over the last decade when diplomatic tensions escalated. Despite these factors, there has been little research on this subject and no major comprehensive critical analysis of cross-cultural visual arts exchange between the two countries. Although the last major visual arts exhibition from Malaysia to Australian state galleries took place between 1969 and 1970, there has been substantial interaction between artists, curators and arts institutions in both countries. From 1983 bilateral visual arts exchange activities expanded and diversified, particularly in the 1990s. Australia has been considered pivotal in assisting the development of contemporary arts in Malaysia. In this regard personal-professional connections on many levels performed an instrumental, if invisible, role in the realisation of exchange programs. This thesis examines issues of cross-cultural engagement and argues that personal-professional considerations are vital to achieving successful outcomes over a longer term period. While official institutions, such as the Australian High Commission in Malaysia, and other agencies in both countries have also been crucial in cultural exchange programs, the involvement of other non-government agencies and individuals has been particularly significant. In this thesis three case studies examine this nexus of government and non-government participants. The projects discussed demonstrate that although outcomes from artist-to-artist or institution-to-institution exchange may not be immediately apparent, benefits may become evident over an extended period of time. While undeniably more complex, projects that involve collaboration and reciprocity tend to yield successful outcomes and consolidate ongoing partnerships. In turn, such projects can provide models for further exchange activity. While not directly serving diplomatic agendas they may nevertheless benefit official and unofficial bilateral relations. In recent years Australian government policy has shifted regional priorities away from the South East Asian region. Nevertheless, while official cultural relations programs have diminished, many visual arts activities instigated between 1998 and 2001 continue to yield beneficial outcomes. This thesis argues that while limits may exist in government policy, programs and funding, collaborative and reciprocal visual arts exchange activities that involve cross-cultural enquiry and cooperation, supported by personal-professional connections, can affirm a positive Australian presence in the region and strengthen bilateral relationships at official and unofficial levels.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24978</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership for regional economic development</field><field name="creator">Warner, John Winston</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on what constitutes leadership for regional economic development in each of three regional cities in South Australia.

The Yellow-footed Rock-wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus xanthopus) is a medium-sized Macropod that inhabits the semiarid rangelands of South Australia and New South Wales. Its conservation status is Vulnerable C2a(i). In this study, population modelling, spatially explicit habitat modelling and Population Viability Analysis (PVA) have been used to better understand the factors that affect the abundance and distribution of the P. x. xanthopus in South Australia. The processes that drive the population dynamics of a species operate at different scales. As such this research involves a collection of several inter-related and scale-specific empirical studies that provide insights about the population dynamics of P. x. xanthopus. Each of these studies captures environmental, demographic and behavioural process acting on the population at different scales. These include the analysis of relative abundance data derived from an aerial census, mark recapture sampling of demographic parameters in relation to rainfall patterns and a collection of habitat models derived at different scales using presence-absence data. Spatially explicit PVAs enable the population dynamics of a species to be modelled in space and time. Using these data, a PVA is conducted to explore and rank the importance of the factors that threaten this species and help guide their future monitoring and management. Movement is also a key issue when considering problems such as isolation and inbreeding. Given that little is known about the dispersal behaviour of this species, a range of different dispersal behaviours are also simulated in the PVA using random and non-random mating algorithms, to estimate the potential for inbreeding.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yellow-footed rock wallaby</field><field name="subject">Animal populations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24981</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Joint source-channel coding for image transmission and related topics</field><field name="creator">Xiang, Wei</field><field name="description">With the integration of wireless technologies and multimedia services, transmitting high quality images and video has become one of the main objectives for next generations mobile network systems. Shannon's classic separation theorem states that, under ideal conditions, source coding and channel coding can be treated separately without sacrificing any performance for the whole system. However, this theorem holds true only under ideal conditions. Practical communication systems do not meet such requirements. Therefore, joint source and channel coding may reduce distortion, as well as complexity and delay. In this thesis, different schemes of joint source-channel coding and decoding for error resilient image transmission over noisy channels are examined. Unequal error protection (UEP) is one of the techniques used in joint source and channel coding. A JPEG image is partitioned into DC components and AC components according to their respective sensitivity to channel noise. The highly sensitive DC components are better protected with a low coding rate, while the less sensitive AC components use a high coding rate. Simulation results show that the proposed UEP scheme slightly outperforms conventional equal error protection (EEP). A novel turbo diversity scheme (TDS) applied to JPEG coded images is proposed. Turbo codes have a built-in structure that is suitable for diversity techniques used to improve the quality of communications over a multi-path channel. The same image data is encoded by two separate turbo encoders and sent over two independent channels. The received data is then passed to a single turbo decoder. By utilising the built-in structure of the turbo encoder, the transmitted JPEG data encoded by a rate half code is recovered at the receiver using a more powerful rate third code yielded by the TDS. An iterative source-channel decoding scheme applied to JPEG coded images is investigated. Huffman codes used as the variable-length coding scheme in JPEG coding can be represented by an irregular VLC-trellis structure. State transition probabilities can be derived from the irregular trellis and can be used as a priori information to help iterative decoding between source and channel a posteriori probability (APP) decoders. Iterative decoding of JPEG coded images only gives a small coding gain due to the poor distance property of the original JPEG Huffman codes. We propose to replace the Huffman codes used in JPEG coding with error resilient source codes with larger free distance. After accounting for the penalty due to the increased average codeword length, the new scheme achieves a 4 dB coding gain over the conventional system for a range of SNRs. While the focus of this thesis is on joint source-channel coding, two other related topics are also examined, namely, capacity and normalisation of intersymbol interference (ISI) channels and parallel data convolutional codes. Previously published results showed a minimum Eb/N0 of -4.6 dB, 3 dB below the capacity of a flat channel, is obtained using the water-pouring capacity formulas for the 1+D channel. However, these results did not take into account that the channel power gain can be greater than unity when water-pouring is used. We present a new generic power normalization method of ISI channel frequency spectra, namely peak bandwidth normalisation, to facilitate the fair capacity comparison of various ISI channels. A final contribution presented in this thesis regards the proposed parallel data convolutional codes (PDCCs). The encoder inputs consist of the original block of data and its interleaved version. We propose a novel single self-iterative soft-input/soft-output (SISO) decoder structure for the decoding of PDCC. It has the advantage of needing only one APP decoder. Although the performance is not very encouraging, the novelty of the self-iterative idea behind the design is worth exploiting.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Coding theory</field><field name="subject">Image transmission</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24982</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into strategies affecting the long-term performance of Chinese chemical companies</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Jeremy</field><field name="description">China has been changing from a centrally planned to a market economy. Its journey has not been a smooth one and is not likely to be easy in the years to come. One of its industry sectors, the chemical industry, which represents approximately 4.6% of its national GDP, is facing challenges in the changing market dynamics. The Chinese government has applied administrative actions rather than simply relying on the market to address these challenges. Fragmentation has been reduced by closing down inefficient chemical plants; merging various companies to form groups. It has also attempted to privatise government owned enterprises by corporatisation and marketisation. Corporatisation of government-owned enterprise refers to alteration of their ownership to create joint stock companies. Marketisation refers to listing those privatised enterprises on the stock market. The objective of this research was to find out whether taking these administrative actions is the best strategy for the Chinese government-owned chemical industry rather than making it more effective by building up state owned chemical enterprises? core competencies and core capabilities. The principal argument of this thesis is based on the resource-based view (RBV).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business planning</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chemical industry</field><field name="subject">Government ownership</field><field name="subject">Privatization</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24934</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body talk and masculinities texting gender without the body</field><field name="creator">Davison, Kevin</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates how masculinities are understood and practiced through the body and how such practices are shaped and limited by modernist theories about gender. The research argues that postmodern theory allows for a greater inclusivity of genders and bodies otherwise marginalised by modernity. A qualitative postmodern and poststructural methodology, combined with a research method involving the collection of all data via an on-line questionnaire, disrupts modernist, dualistic thinking about the body and gender. By distancing the physical body from the research method, and thus separating, temporarily, discourses of gender which inhabit the body, this research creates counter-hegemonic spaces to re-articulate masculine identities and practices within the postmodern condition. Furthermore, the postmodern theory and methodology informing this work unsettles the belief that physical bodies can be counted on to reveal consistent truths. The contextualisation of this work includes a chapter that recounts various historical moments where technological advancements made way for the re-consideration and re-negotiation of gender and bodies. The intersections of technology and modernity are examined along with the rise of the postmodern condition and the advancement of computer technologies. Shifts in understanding, influenced by postmodern theory and human-computer interaction, are discussed in relation to their challenges to modernist boundaries of ?the real? and, in turn, the possibilities of gender articulations. Additionally, a chapter containing critical researcher reflexivity through an autobiographical account of masculinities and schooling acts to illustrate some of the complexities, contradictions, privileges and counter-hegemonic possibilities of masculinities and bodies. Although the majority of the research participants identified as ?male?, some identified as ?female? and others identified as ?intersex?. The geographic identities of the respondents included Australia, The United Kingdom, Ireland, The United States, and Japan. The data were analysed using postmodern and poststructural theory. The subjectivity and the role of the researcher in the analysis of data were interrogated alongside the words of the participants. The responses were grouped into four areas: Being and Knowing; The Body Engendered; Bodies On-Line and On the Line, and New Articulations. In all four areas the participants? words demonstrate tensions between modern and postmodern understandings of bodies and genders. Computer technologies often replicate modernist images of gender and bodies, yet at the same time they provide a postmodern space of multiplicity, fluidity, and hybridity, where rigid modernist configurations cannot hold. The analysis illuminates, diffracts, disrupts, and highlights disjunctures and new possibilities for gender and bodies mediated by contemporary computer and Internet technologies. Lastly, Benjaminian dialectical images were used to transform fixed modernist beliefs about gender and bodies and to move the reader toward alternative ways of understanding gender which are not body dependent.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Body image in men</field><field name="subject">Gender identity</field><field name="subject">Men</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24935</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhetoric of adolescent fiction the pedagogy of reading practices in South Australian secondary English classes</field><field name="creator">Van der Hoeven, Sieta</field><field name="description">This study examines the experiences of teachers and students in secondary English classes, as they engage in the reading of contemporary adolescent fiction, when such fiction is set as a class text. This study also includes an examination of students' perceptions of such reading, and of reading in general. The aim of the study is to add to the knowledge about what actually goes on inside English classrooms during the teaching of literature, and within that field,  to specify how teacher-student interaction in the classroom defines and positions the kinds of meanings that are made of literary texts. Therefore, this study focuses on the teaching of units of work related to the reading of adolescent fiction novels by three South Australian English teachers, based in three different metropolitan schools.The central focus is on the teachers? plans for these units of work, and on the outcomes: that is, on teacher-student interactions during the time spent in class on the novel, and on students? written and oral responses. Thus this study also focuses on the learning that took place in these classrooms, as students made meaning from their reading.In the review of the literature, the role of the literary novel as the class ?set text? in its several historical contexts is examined, as well as current theories of reading, of pedagogy, and of literary criticism. Finally this study is placed in the context of other related studies and its contribution to the field explained.An interpretive approach is employed and methods of educational ethnography are used to what was visualised from the outset would be qualitative research in the form of case studies. Some quantification is used in this research to report on a small-scale survey, using a questionnaire to create a ?readers? profile of the cohort of student-informants as a whole. Metaphors were used to encapsulate the teachers? teaching styles, and their intentions and practices analysed to uncover the underlying theories on which these intentions and practices were based. Throughout, but especially in the final chapter, the related notions of ?enjoyment? and ?the teaching of reading? at secondary school levels, as well as the concept of reflectivity, are examined for their impact on reading pedagogy. Finally, some suggestions are made for possible and desirable future research and teacher professional development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reading (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">Teacher-student relationships</field><field name="subject">Teenagers</field><field name="subject">Books and reading</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of pricing in relationship marketing a study of the Singapore heavy equipment spare parts industry</field><field name="creator">Chong, Kum Whye</field><field name="description">UUProblem Members of the Singapore Heavy Equipment Spare Parts Industry face a multitude of challenges in developing their pricing strategy and practice, and in establishing, developing, and maintaining successful relational exchanges. They are unable to obtain any guidance from the pricing or relationship marketing literature. These works are either too complex or too general to be of any use to industry members. Consequently, much of industry strategy and practice occurs without the benefit of theory. UUThe Method An extensive review of existing literature was conducted in the major subject areas of pricing and relationship marketing. Literature on other subjects of channels, marketing mix, strategy, value, commitment, trust, cooperation, and satisfaction were also reviewed. A survey instrument was developed and field research was administered to 35 channel members of the industry. The results were analysed using SPSS 11. The results were used to construct a model of the role of pricing in relationship marketing. The model was constructed using Factor Analysis, Correlation Analysis and Regression Analysis. UUThe Findings The findings are all based on the perception of the channel members. Nine factors were extracted. These non-trivial factors to the Singapore Heavy Equipment Spare Parts Industry are: - Downstream supply considerations; - Product/Stock allocations; - Price gap resolution; - Perception of value/profitability; - Business volume; - Intermediate business relationships; - Leads and referrals; - Favourable pricing; and - Long-run relationships. At 5% significance (2-tailed), 4 construct paths were supported. These are: - Support gap correlates with actual price; - Support gap correlates with value; - Support gap correlates with price gap; and - Price gap correlates with value. At 5% significance (2-tailed), 8 hypotheses were supported. These are: - Price gap resolution correlates with commitment; - Price gap resolution correlates with cooperation; - Price gap resolution correlates with satisfaction; - Importance of constructive acts correlates with improved business volume; - Expression of intention to increase business correlates with increased business; - Importance of value correlates with increased business; - Value (through profitability) correlates with increased business; and - Importance of value correlates with improvements in: - Trust; - Commitment; - Cooperation; - Satisfaction; and - Increased business. UUConclusion Pricing has a profound and multi-faceted role in relationship marketing. It is a powerful tool. It has a role as a market tool with new relationships, as a development tool in the growth phase of relationships, and as a control tool in the mature phase of bilateral relationships between first and second echelon distributors. The study recommended that channel members utilise this tool concept and the management of value, price, and support gap in relational exchanges.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Construction equipment inustry</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Pricing</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24937</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Succession planning for middle managers in US subsidiaries in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Neirynck, Baudouin C R</field><field name="description">During the 1990's, most Hong Kong companies experienced extremely high Voluntary Turnover among middle managers.

Confucian values emphasize a way of life. They are based on first cultivating oneself with the basic four virtues highlighted by Confucius (551 - 479 BC). Secondly, through the influence of the individual on others (via the five relationships, namely ruler-subject, father-son, brother-brother, husband-wife and friend-friend illustrated by Confucius), a 'perfect' world with peace and harmony can be created. This study investigates the degree to which the four distinct virtues - 1) human-kindness (ren), 2) integrity (yi), 3) propriety (li) and 4) knowledge (chi) and the five relationships, 1) ruler-subject, 2) father-son, 3) husband-wife, 4) brother-brother and 5) friend-friend, were adopted to underpin the practices of Human Resource Management (HRM) in Singapore. The target group of respondents chosen was executives, who were directly influenced by the style of human resource management in the firm. Electronics/technology related firms based in Singapore were the chosen group. The executives were chosen from electronics/technology related firms because these firms formed the most important industry, responsible for the well being of Singapore's growth (24% of GDP as stated by the Department of Statistics; 1999) and expected to continue so for the next 10 years. Managers from the same firms were given another set of questionnaires to verify the responses obtained from the executives. From the result obtained, it showed that there were influences of Confucian values on the five human resources functions tested. The executives' responses provided evidence on whether or not a certain trait or style has been used in the firm. The managers' responses, on the other hand, helped to verify that the trait or style was due to the influence of Confucian values as a whole and not other cultures or religions. The entire survey and interviews were carried out over twenty months from 1998, during which responses obtainable from both the managers and executives from each firm were analyzed. The data were analyzed using cross-tabulations and chi-square tests because cross-tabulation is one statistical tool which required only at least 5 responses in each cell for a reliable analysis to be conducted (Yong, 1994). Letters were then sent out to the Heads/Managers of the target firms, conducting interviews to obtain more insights to argue the survey data. Two interviews were conducted, taped and results obtained from the quantitative approach, helped further clarify earlier interpretations. This research showed that Singapore-based electronics/technology-related firms, regardless whether they were locally owned or foreign owned, showed that they were influenced by Confucian values in most aspects of the human resource practices. In addition, from the study, it showed that there were no significant differences between locally owned firms and foreign owned firms in terms of the degree of influence Confucian values have on the style of the management. This demonstrated that Chinese culture (in this case - Confucian values) - local/host country's culture played a stronger influence on the style of management in businesses conducted in Singapore than the organization's culture. This finding is important as most past research findings such as Rodrigues (1996) used to state that the organizational culture of the foreign-owned firms often have stronger influence on the practices adopted in firms regardless of the country that they were in. Lastly, after analyzing the responses obtained from the survey, the study justified that four virtues and only three (i.e. ruler-subject, friend-friend, father-son) of the five relationships outlined by Confucius has an impact on the style of HRM amongst Singapore-based firms in the technology/electronics-related industry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Confucianism</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24939</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integer programming methods for solving multi-skilled workforce optimisation problems</field><field name="creator">Eitzen, Guy E</field><field name="description">Generating employee rosters on a 24 hour, 7 day per week basis taking into account fluctuating demand for employees, employee skills, working conditions, training and employee preferences, while ensuring efficiency and equity between the employees is a very difficult task due to the very large number of possible rostering combinations available.

It evaluated the link between an educator?s own sense of enchantment, imagination and creativeness and the quality of the program offered to young children in childcare centres. The study also identified ways of enriching the care of children in childcare centres through programs that would enhance the children?s imagination and creativeness, utilising the individuality of the teacher/carer?s own ideas on creativity and program design. A case-study methodology was chosen to determine the answers to the posed questions. Three case studies in Hobart and one in Brisbane, using a variety of research tools, including interviews, the application of a creativity assessment sheet, observations and photography, were used to answer the research questions. The results in this small-scale study showed that the early childhood educator's own sense of enchantment and use of imagination and creativity did correlate with the children's imagination and creativity and also with the quality of the program.

Both sociological and psychological factors influence the use of police discretionary powers. There are said to be strong relationships between authoritarianism, for example, and justice outcomes. Other measures, such as cynicism and punitiveness, have been observed to be influential predictors of police behaviour. Extending the work on jury decision-making, along with other police research, the present research examines use of police discretionary powers with young offenders. Sworn police officers from two jurisdictions, New Zealand and New South Wales, responded to written surveys about their past and intended future behaviour surrounding four crimes most commonly conducted by young offenders. In all, over 500 officers took part in the studies. Further, participants responded to a battery of personality and attitude questionnaires, along with questions about situational variables normally taken into consideration by officers. Results show that police behaviour towards the same offending varies greatly, both within and across jurisdictions. New Zealand police officers were much more likely than New South Wales police officers to report that they diverted, rather than arrested, young offenders who had committed shoplifting and burglary offences. However, when responding to scenarios of underage drinking and assault, it was New South Wales police who were more likely to divert young offenders. There were very few significant relationships between attitudes and behaviour when examining either group, with significant results possibly being a side effect of large sample sizes. Further there were few significant relationships when considering demographic or situational variables. However, in an exploration of police personality, through cluster analysis, evidence was found for different 'typologies', or resonances, of police. The results indicate that police are not an homogenous group. In addition, quite complex relationships between measures of police behaviour and individual difference were found within the resonances, with effect sizes showing moderate results. The findings support the need to investigate further personality typologies and extend them to the examination of attitude-behaviour relationships. In addition, research into the use of an attitudinal measure, such as discretionary ideology, as an alternative to measuring behaviour could be expanded. Moreover, broadening of the research into additional areas of the juvenile justice systems, such as legal representatives, magistrates, and youth detention centre officers, would provide further insight into the appropriate use of discretion within juvenile justice for both minor offending and more serious offending.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police services for juveniles</field><field name="subject">Police discretion</field><field name="subject">Law enforcement</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Juvenile delinquency</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24956</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hidden hand and the fluid object : craft in three sites of representation</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Donald William</field><field name="description">Craft's role in its traditional sites is changing.

Consequently, effective removal of these metabolites from drinking water is paramount. The combination of ozone (O3) and granular activated carbon (GAC) has been shown to be effective for the removal of these metabolites from drinking water. In this study, the ozonation of MIB and geosmin was affected by the character of natural organic material (NOM). In particular, NOM containing compounds of high UV absorbing properties and high molecular weight (MW) resulted in greater destruction of MIB and geosmin due to the formation of hydroxyl (OH) radicals. In addition, alkalinity also affected the ozonation process, with waters containing higher alkalinity resulting in decreased destruction of MIB and geosmin. Laboratory scale minicolumn experiments, coupled with the homogenous surface diffusion model (HSDM), were found to be ineffective in predicting the GAC breakthrough behaviour of MIB and microcystin at two different pilot plants. This can be attributed to the biological degradation of the metabolites at the pilot plants which cannot be modelled by the HSDM. In addition, the volume of GAC used in the minicolumn experiments may not have been appropriate for the predictions, rather, larger laboratory scale columns were found to be more applicable in mimicking pilot plant results. Microcystins were shown to be readily degraded by the bacteria attached to the GAC. Furthermore, the lag period prior to the onset of degradation, which is indicative of most biological degradation studies, was effectively eliminated and in one instance abated. This finding suggests that biological filtration of microcystin is practically feasible especially since the occurrence of microcystins in water supplies is seasonal. This study expands on previous research in the area of O3 and GAC for the treatment of MIB, geosmin and microcystin. With the imminent increase of the use of O3 and GAC in Australian water treatment plants (WTPs), this study provides valuable information for the use of these processes both alone and in combination, particularly since minimal research in this area has been conducted in Australia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drinking water</field><field name="subject">Purification</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24958</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantification of the relationship between fish populations and seagrass</field><field name="creator">McArthur, Lynne Caryn</field><field name="description">Seagrass is an underwater flowering plant that thrives in clear, sheltered, coastal waters around the world. As well as providing habitat for the marine fauna, seagrass meadows play an important role in the processes and resources of near-shore ecosystems. Coastal degradation of seagrass is prevalent along the metropolitan beaches of Adelaide, a problem common to settled coastal areas around the world, and although evidence from the literature suggests that loss of seagrass beds adversely affects the abundance of some coastal fish species, no quantification of the effect has been attempted. Moreover, although the economic value of seagrass as an 'ecosystem service' has been estimated, its value as a contributor to the productivity of the marine environment has not. In this thesis, mathematical and statistical models are used to explore the relationships that exist between seagrass habitats and the fish, crustacean, and mollusc species that depend upon them. The result is a model which estimates the annual value of seagrass loss to the secondary production in our coastal waters.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seagrasses</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Coastal ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24960</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictive power control in CDMA systems</field><field name="creator">Kurniawan, Adit</field><field name="description">This study is aimed at solving several important problems relating to power control in CDMA systems. Our focus is on the mobile to basestation (reverse) link. In this study, we propose a new SIR estimator for CDMA systems, using an auxiliary spreading sequence method. The proposed SIR estimator is employed at the basestation to estimate the SIR, which serves as a control parameter in the power control algorithm. The effects of system parameters (step size, power-update rate, feedback delay, SIR measurement error, and command error) on the bit error rate (BER) performance of power control are investigated. Feedback delay is found to be the most critical parameter that causes a serious problem in the loop. To solve this problem, we propose to use a channel prediction technique at the basestation. To further improve the performance of power control, we then propose to use a diversity reception technique using antenna arrays at the basestation. We show that this combination allows solving the problems linked to the use of power control in a real system affected by multiple access interference under fading conditions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code division multiple access</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24961</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iterative receiver techniques for coded multiple access communication systems</field><field name="creator">Reed, Mark C</field><field name="description">The introduction of cellular wireless systems in the 1980s has resulted in a huge demand for personal communication services. This demand has made larger capacity systems necessary. This has been partially satisfied by the introduction of second generation digital systems. New third generation systems are now under going standardisation and will require even more efficient utilisation of the spectrum if the high bandwidth features and larger capacity are to become a reality. Motivated by these growing requirements we discuss methods of achieving large improvements in spectral efficiency and performance. Multiple-user communications over a channel can only be achieved with some form of diversity. In this work we point out that the efficient utilisation of the dimensions of space, time, and frequency will ultimately maximise the system capacity of a multiple-user system. We apply our receiver techniques solely to the base-station design where capacity limitations are currently present. We note however, that some of these techniques could also be applied at the mobile terminal receiver. We primarily focus our attention on the direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) channel, since this channel is inherently interference limited by other users in the cell of interest. We exploit a new powerful channel coding technique named " turbo coding" for its iterative decoding approach. We show how we can substitute the inner convolutional code of a turbo code encoder with the CDMA channel. By " iterative detection/decoding" or " turbo equalisation" at the receiver we achieve performance results which show the interference from other users to approach complete removal. We develop and analyse a new, low complexity, iterative interference canceller/decoder. This receiver has complexity per user linear with the memory of the channel and independent of the number of users in the system. We extend this receiver to more realistic channels that are asynchronous and include multi-path, and include spatial diversity by using an antenna array at the receiver. The CDMA channel we study exclusively uses randomly generated spreading codes. With this channel model we still achieve single user performance (no interference from other users) with a 10logL gain from L antenna elements and a gain of up to 10logP from P multi-path components. With any new receiver design, sensitivity to channel parameter errors is of paramount interest. We find that the sensitivity of our receiver is low with respect to the parameter errors induced. This is as we desire for a realisable receiver design. Finally we investigate the application of this new iterative interference canceller/decoder receiver to a number of other interference channels. These include the intersymbol interference (ISI) channel, partial response signalling (PRS), and continuous phase modulation (CPM). For these channels excellent performance improvement is generally achieved by the utilisation of the iterative interference canceller/decoder solution.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code division multiple access</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24962</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:24962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a screening tool to determine the modifiable falls and injury risk profile in unsteady older adults</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Michele A</field><field name="description">This study enabled the development of a brief, clinically fesible screening tool for falls and injury risk identification in older community-dwelling adults through a range of methods that included a literature review, a Case Note Audit of 128 people attending Falls and Balance clinic, and group,processes (Nominal Group and Delphi Panel with 12 and 10 participants respectively).

The feasibility of integrating the steering and drive systems and the performance advantages that may be obtained was investigated. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the steering system and the drive system of a test vehicle were integrated using a computer with a specially-developed program. The software algorithm developed for the program used the mathematical relationship between the rear drive wheel speeds and the steer angles of the non-driven front wheels to set the steer angles. A test-bed vehicle was fitted with instrumentation to implement the computer-integrated system. The circuitry of the hydraulic lines of the hydraulically-driven test vehicle was modified to allow changes in drive configuration. These changes are not possible with conventional vehicles. The test vehicle could be configured for the following steering-drive configurations: open differential rear drive with steerable front wheels, independent rear drive wheels with front castors, locked differential rear drive with steerable front wheels and the computer-integrated steering-drive system developed. The sensors on the vehicle allowed data collection for characterising the vehicle and wheels. omputer models were developed for the various steering-drive configurations from the force relationships, longitudinal slip relationships, vehicle geometry and turning geometry. Characteristics of the test vehicle's wheels for use in the models were measured experimentally. he models were used to simulate the behaviour, and calculate the tractive performance, of the four steering-drive configurations in various situations but actual tests were not able to be conducted with the available resources. Unlike previous models, the models of this research used force and longitudinal slip information rather than power input and power output to produce values for drawbar efficiency. theoretical analysis was conducted into the optimal slip conditions for maximum tractive efficiency. The analysis was conducted using a more rigorous mathematical analysis than previous researchers and used a thorough graphical analysis to substantiate the mathematical analysis. Previous studies concluded that under all traction conditions the efficiency of slip will be a maximum when the slip of each wheel is equal. This research revealed that, contrary to the previous literature, efficiency of slip will not be a maximum when the slip of each wheel is equal under non-uniform traction conditions. The simulations were focussed on turning situations, non-uniform traction conditions and traversing slopes. The optimal slip conditions and steer angles for turning situations were also investigated and analysed. The computer-integrated steering-drive system achieved a drawbar pull 50% higher than that for a conventional open differential when undertaking a 10 m radius turn with non-uniform traction conditions. Under these conditions, the drawbar efficiency of the computer-integrated steering-drive system was 5% greater than that for the open differential at the lower drawbar pull. It was concluded that it is feasible and beneficial to use a computer-integrated steering system. Vehicles using such a system would operate more effectively and efficiently when turning under load, moving across slopes and in non-uniform traction conditions. More effectiveness was provided through greater drawbar pull and higher drawbar efficiency.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobiles</field><field name="subject">Steering-gear</field><field name="subject">Steering-drive</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/44846</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Police as peacekeepers an evaluation of the performance of Australian police peacekeeping on Cyprus 1964 - 1998</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, R J</field><field name="description">This research considers the use of Australian police officers as peacekeepers on Cyprus and, in particular, evaluates their performance.

Instead of adopting traditional perceptual methods for identifying and describing competitors, this thesis takes an empirical approach by applying the behaviourally grounded Duplication of Purchase Law.    The Duplication of Purchase (DOP) Law is an empirical generalisation that illustrates the structure of competitive markets through simple patterns of repeat purchase (Goodhardt, Ehrenberg et al. 1984). It states that brands share their customers with other brands in line with penetration levels, where penetration is the proportion of people who buy an item at all in any given time period (Uncles, Ehrenberg et al. 1995; Ehrenberg, Uncles et al. 2003). This means that any brand will share customers more with other bigger brands and far less with the smaller brands. Consequently, it is a very useful tool that can help identify and predict the competitive market structure, by simply knowing each individual brand's market share.    This research specifically addresses whether the DOP Law can be successfully applied to the international tourist market using destinations as brands. It analyses and predicts how brands such as 'Destination France' or Destination USA' compete on an international scale, and discusses the instances where the competition is identified as being substantially more, or less, intense.

When the source data for a materialized view is updated, the materialized view also needs to be updated. The process of updating a materialized view in response to changes in the source data is called view maintenance. There are two methods for maintaining a materialized view - recomputation and incremental computation. Recomputation computes the new view instance from scratch using the updated sources data. Incremental computation on the other hand, computes the new view instance by using the update to the source data, the old view instance, and possibly some source data. Incremental computation is widely accepted as a less expensive mathod of maintaining a view when the size of the update to the source data is small in relation to the size of the source data.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Database management</field><field name="subject">Relational databases</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of performance feedback in the self-assessment of nursing practice</field><field name="creator">Fereday, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">This interpretive study explores the phenomenon of performance feedback within nursing.

The criteria for decision-making may be perceived as based on organisational or financial need, rather than creative output or social need. It is my view that the perceptions need testing. To do this I needed a way of understanding how decisions are reached in a variety of different contexts within the arts and cultural sector. Most would concede that decision-making is not a precise science. My quest thus became finding an appropriate research methodology for these explorations. Action research emerged as a useful framework for adding understanding within dynamic situations. This thesis reports on the usefulness of participatory action research as a tool for the exploration of decision-making processes by a range of people working within the arts and cultural sectors. Incremental view research has attracted extensive research in recent years. View maintenance techniques have been developed for the relational model, the temporal model, the object-oriented model, and the semistructured model. However, research into view maintenance in the non relational model is not complete and, in particular, the issue of view maintenance in nested relational databases and in object- relational (OR) databases has not been investigated. this motivates our research in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts</field><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community participation in organising rural general medical practice three case studies in South Australia</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Judy</field><field name="description">It is well documented that rural and remote Australian residents have poorer access to medical services than their counterparts in capital cities. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 1998 there were 75.3 vocationally registered general practitioners per 100,000 population in rural and remote areas, compared with 103.0 per 100,000 in metropolitan areas. In 1998 28.7% of the Australian population lived in rural and remote areas, so a substantial proportion of the Australian population is adversely affected by the unequal distribution of general practitioners. Australian country communities highly regard the services of general practitioners and they continue to demand residential medical services. Demand is driven by need for access to health services, but also by the intimate inter-relationships between the general practice and community sustainability. For example, the general practice contributes to the viability of the local hospital which is often a major employer in the district. Consequently, many country communities strive to keep their general practice by contributing to practice infrastructure, providing governance, raising funds for medical equipment, and actively helping recruitment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rural health services</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Community health services</field><field name="subject">Citizen participation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Health planning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/24996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Fairness of outcome' in the mediation of industrial disputes</field><field name="creator">Joyce, Henry David</field><field name="description">Mediation, as a prominent 'alternative dispute resolution' (ADR) process, has been spreading across various legal jurisdictions in Australia and overseas. Because both the process and the outcome are seen to be 'owned' by the disputants, it has been assessed by Australian governments as being appropriate to the decentralised industrial relations systems developed in the 1990's. This led to proposals to create independent mediation services that would supplement the conciliation-arbitration service available in the Federal and South Australian industrial relation commissions. This study canvassed these proposals in light of the various benefits claimed for mediation and explored the confused usage of the terms mediation and conciliation in relation to industrial disputes.

Increased demand for flexibility, capital utilisation and competition have initiated or extended shiftwork operations in many industry sectors such as mining, transport, defence, healthcare, manufacturing and security. The most common problems reported by shiftworkers are disturbed sleep and sleepiness. From a biological perspective this is not surprising because shiftworkers are often required to work at times when their mind and body are driven toward sleep. Shiftworkers may therefore be required to attempt sleep during the day; a time at which their mind and body are programmed to be awake and active. When sufficient recovery doesn't occur regularly, sleepiness and fatigue can accumulate. Traditionally, shiftwork and the work-related fatigue that it can create have been 'managed' by limiting the length of shifts and total number of hours worked per week, month or year. However, this approach fails to acknowledge key factors such as the time-of-day of work. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to provide the background, components and preliminary validations of a model to assess hours-of-work and fatigue in a scientifically appropriate manner.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">shift systems</field><field name="subject">health aspects</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25025</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Female circumcision a religious rite in Islamic Africa? : a review of the Islamic sources</field><field name="creator">Wiggins, Des</field><field name="description">This thesis reviews the practice of female circumcision in Islamic Africa. I chose this geographical location for my study because of the high incidence of female circumcision in Africa. The majority of female circumcision in Africa is practiced in cultures that follow the religion of Islam. The general consensus of contemporary literature in this field of study argues that female circumcision has no religious basis for the practice. This is based on the fact that the Quran contains no explicit, or implicit, command for the practice. I disagree with this approach and believe my thesis fills a gap that exists in current literature. I argue that there are two main perspectives within Islam which I define as Quranic Islam and traditional Islam. Quranic Islam is defined in this thesis as the Muslim faith that accepts only the Quran as the basis and sole authority for its beliefs and practices. Traditional Islam is defined as the Muslim faith that accepts the Quran, and extra-Quranic sources - such as, but not limited to, the Haddith, Sharia, Sunna, and fatwas - as the basis for its belief structure. I argue that the basis for accepting the practice of female circumcision as a religious rite in Islamic Africa is found in traditional Islam.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clitoridectomy</field><field name="subject">Africa</field><field name="subject">Female circumcision</field><field name="subject">Sex customs</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"If you want to know about it just ask" exploring disabled young people's experiences of health and healthcare</field><field name="creator">Bricher, Gillian</field><field name="description">In today's climate of consumer consultation in the development of client sensitive hospital and community based services, some voices have remained silent. Among this group are disabled children and young people, who receive professional care in a climate of 'in their best interest', firmly based on notions of abnormality and the inherent tragedy of disability. New paradigm childhood research and the social model of disability provide the theoretical framework for this qualitative study into the health and health care experiences of disabled children and young people. Both approaches demand a flexible and participatory approach in order to challenge the traditional relations of research production. Twenty young people aged 9-18 years met with the researcher up to four times, with a choice after the initial meeting of individual or group meetings. All had a physical disability, some also had communication or learning difficulties. Conversations with the young people covered a range of topics. The obvious ones related to hospitals, appointments, splints and therapy. About what it is like having a carer. Commonly held assumptions that hospitalisation is a significant feature of disabled childhoods is challenged by the data, appointments however reflect an ongoing surveillance. The young people spoke of experiences of empowerment and of powerlessness within a triad of parent:professional:young person. Concern that many treatments are an experiment and that outcomes are hard to balance with the pain and inconvenience of surgery or therapeutic devices raises questions regarding professional versus young person's definitions of success. It also demands debate regarding how much remedial intervention is enough. This is a difficult issue in a medical and social climate that idealises normality, but normality is not often an option. Health care constitutes only a narrow perspective of health and made up only a part of the discussion. It is the day to day health experiences that are more prominent in the lives of participants than intermittent professional services. The young people showed a recognition of factors that contributed to their health and sense of well being. Commonly the talk was about living in a world that considers them as different and the effect that has on them. These young people are making links between racism and their own disability experience, however they have no contact with disabled adults, some with no other disabled young people and no understanding of disability history or politics. This lack became even more evident when the participants talked about who understands what their life is like, of role models, realistic aspirations and dreams for quiet moments. School issues raised concerns such as equity in access, being different, having to prove oneself, limited school sport involvement and issues of friendship and teasing. One very powerful finding is that just like anyone else they are all different but that stereotypes of disability limit the lives of disabled young people and influence the responses of other people to them. This demanded from the researcher an interaction with the different experiences and responses to experiences of participants or risk creating another, albeit different stereotype.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young adults with disabilities</field><field name="subject">People with disabilities</field><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="subject">Medical ethics</field><field name="subject">Social medicine</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship issues and newly released male prisoners</field><field name="creator">Padman, Jeanette</field><field name="description">This research examines the factors that impact on a newly released male prisoner's ability to deal with relationship issues.

The researcher was one of the academic participants. Data were collected in the final eighteen months of the project using participant observation, the researcher's journal, interviews, document review and a written questionnaire. The data analysis revealed findings about three phases of the project: the initiation phase; the implementation phase; and the reviewing outcomes phase. The findings for the initiation phase were: 1. Many teachers in the selected schools, and teacher educators at the university, did not have the opportunity to participate in the project. 2. Most participants were motivated by personal reasons and a commitment to organisational and/or partnership goals. 3. Participants varied in the extent to which they knew about and had the opportunity to interpret project expectations at the local level. The findings for the implementation phase were: 1. There was wide variation in the extent to which participants valued professional discourse, critical reflection, action research and professional reading and writing as processes for school reform. 2. Some participants found it difficult to learn project processes quickly. 3. Most participants were not able to manage the demands of the project without extending their hours of work and workloads. 4. Some relationships developed within the project were undemocratic and inequitable in some respects. 5. Only some aspects of the contexts in which participants worked supported achievement of the project expectations, while others proved to be a hindrance. The findings about the reviewing outcomes phase were: 1. Participants learnt about improved teaching, learning and educational reform from working together, but some opportunities for reciprocal learning were missed. 2. Participants' ability to translate learning into educational improvement was impeded by contextual constraints. 3. Many participants found it difficult to determine whether improvement had occurred. 4. Most participants found that working in the partnerships enhanced their relationships and professional standing with other participants, but not with non participants. The findings illuminated four areas of complexity in the research and development partnerships that were studied. Firstly, the extent to which the implicit assumptions underpinning project expectations were congruent with the reality of the conditions impacting on participants influenced their achievement of the expectations. Secondly, the interaction of a complex array of personal, structural and cultural conditions supported or hindered participants' ability to achieve the project expectations. Thirdly, participants' experiences, and the conditions that influenced them, changed as they moved through the different phases of initiation, implementation and reviewing outcomes. Finally, the key challenges that were evident in the research and development partnerships were: developing equitable ownership within each organisation and the partnerships; managing the affective dimensions of research, development and partnership; reconceptualising and restructuring educators' work; reconciling disparate constructions of learning, teaching, research and reform; and facilitating reciprocal learning for teachers and academics. The areas of complexity illuminated by the study suggested a series of recommendations for ways that future school/university research and development partnerships might be improved.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational change</field><field name="subject">College-school cooperation</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Teacher effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">In-service training</field><field name="subject">Training of</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25030</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing on the minefield : feminist counter-readings of women in Proverbs 1-9</field><field name="creator">Wurst, Shirley J J</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a series of feminist counter-readings of the two women in Proverbs 1-9: Woman Wisdom and the Strange-and-Foolish Woman. It therefore seeks to both discern and challenge the traditional male scholarship's understandings of both women, and, more importantly, to read both as women rather than as stereotypes. Most readings of the text construe Woman Wisdom as a personification or a hypostasis, and the Strange-and-Foolish Woman as a stereotype or series of stereotypes of promiscuous and assertively sexual women. Few scholars focus on the significance of these representations of women as women. My feminist counter-reading methodology involves a triple hermeneutic-suspicion, resistance, rereading and representation. This hermeneutic is also informed by an insistently embodied reading practice. My methodology draws on various fields of feminist scholarship, including feminist literary theory and film theory, feminist hermeneutics and feminist biblical criticism, feminist theories of embodiment, and feminist epistemology. In addition, I use contemporary ideas relating to translation to re-translate key terms integral to the focus of my thesis. Each chapter of the thesis focuses on a site of contestation-both within biblical scholarship and within the text. As a piece of feminist scholarship, this thesis both works within the constraints of the traditional understanding of a thesis and contemporary 'malestream' scholarship, and pushes gently at the boundaries, seeking to make spaces for different ways to approach, and write, theses. The first four chapters focusing on the textual analysis are presented as being in a constellation relationship with each other and the later textual analyses. Using a variety of strategies, originating in a variety of feminist disciplines, I have demonstrated that both Woman Wisdom and the Strange-and-Foolish Woman can be read as representations of real women. In each case, their representations-in-the-text are partial, designed to categorise them in the interests of the male system (malestream), and to keep them separate from each other. I also demonstrate, however, that both women resist these attempts at patriarchal and androcentric colonisation. Woman Wisdom, in assertively building her own house within the malestream, claims her own space for her alternative way of wisdom in the male-dominated world of the text. Using her location 'inside' the system to gain access to the young future leaders-both men and women-she disseminates her alternative way with the apparent approval of the system. Contrary to the view of most scholars, she does not speak with the voice of the patriarchal system-she has her own style, and her own message, which she shares freely with all who accept her invitation to her feast of wisdom. The Strange-and-Foolish Woman more openly resists malestream attempts to control and confine her. Like Woman Wisdom, she resorts to resistance strategies to access her audience: she masquerades as a vamp to attract her audience and poke fun at the foibles of the 'wise' old men who denigrate her sexuality but secretly lust after her body. She, too, is a woman who defines herself, and her way of being sexual, and seeks to make a space for an alternative way of being woman, and celebrating her sexuality, in the world of the text.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en-aus</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bible and feminism</field><field name="subject">Women in the Bible</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25031</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of the performance of intellectually disabled children on the WISC-111 and SB-1V</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Daryl P</field><field name="description">This study investigated the results of administering two intelligence tests, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children -Third Edition (WISC-111), and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition, to each of 33 Australian children with an intellectual disability. The experiment used a counterbalanced design in which the tests, order of presentation of the tests, the gender of the subjects, and the gender of the test administrators were factors. The 33 volunteer subjects, 14 males and 19 females, aged between 6 and 16 years, and known to have an intellectual disability, were allocated randomly for the assessments. The test administrators were students in the Clinical and Organisational Masters Program from the University of South Australia. It was hypothesised that; there would be a difference between the IQs on the two tests; that on average the WISC-111 FSIQ would be lower than the SB-1V TC; and that there would be a positive relationship between the WISC-111 FSIQ and the SB-1 V TC Statistical analysis of the data found the two tests' overall scores to be significantly different, while the counterbalanced factors and their interactions did not reach significance. There was a significant 4 point difference found between the mean WISC-111 FSIQs and SB-1V TCs. The results of a Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient revealed a strong positive correlation (r = .83). between the WISC-111 FSIQ and SB-1V TC. This finding supported the concurrent validity of the tests in this special population sample. It was suggested that while the two tests measured similar theoretical constructs of intelligence, the two tests were not identical and therefore the results were not interchangeable. Variable patterns of results were found among subtest scores from the two tests, and the implications for field work discussed. The differences between raw WISC-111 FSIQ and SB-1V TC scores were calculated, and a z transformation was applied to the difference scores. The resulting difference distribution and cumulative percentages were then suggested as a reference table for practitioners. Studies that examined clerical errors in scoring intelligence test protocols were reviewed. The manually scored test protocols in this study were rescored using a computer scoring programme and 27 errors were found and corrected. From the results of the experiment several suggestions were made; that agencies using large numbers of intelligence tests, or which test the same child over time, should make a decision to use the same test, wherever possible, for comparison; that all intelligence test protocols be computer scored as a checking mechanism; and that all professional staff should be aware of the possible differences which can occur between intelligence scores, resulting from norming and other differences.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning disabled children</field><field name="subject">Testing</field><field name="subject">Stanford-Binet Test</field><field name="subject">Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25032</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public stories, private lives an inquiry into the role of story in 'middle Australia'</field><field name="creator">De Roeper, Julia</field><field name="description">In Australia, family storytelling and religion, the traditional sources of shared stories, are in decline.

It has been argued that there is an important connection between an individual?s perception of their own place in the world, their understanding of what constitutes a good life and how to live it, and their ability to empathise with the lives and problems of others (MacIntyre, 1981; Taylor, 1989; Aristotle, 1996; Kearney, 2002). The research indicates that this core bundle of values, attitudes and beliefs is commonly derived from the stories to which individuals are exposed from an early age. Access to stories with which the individual can personally identify and which are familiar to and shared with those around them is crucial in establishing a satisfactory self-narrative (Polkinghorne, 1988), and to the individual's ability to communicate it successfully through the process of triple mimesis (Ricoeur, 1991/1980). Of crucial importance is access to sharable stories which resemble significant aspects of the recipient's own life and circumstances. Respondents who had endured personal difficulties were more likely to accept their circumstances and live successful lives when they had been able to identify with a story describing a similar problem and its credible resolution. However, individuals who had been unable to identify with a public story and establish a satisfactory self-narrative were more likely to be socially dysfunctional. The research also indicates a correlation between exposure to word-based stories at an early age, and the later development of imagination and ambition. People who only experienced visual stories in their early years appeared less articulate, less able to imagine things beyond their own experience, and were less ambitious in their career aspirations. Australia is an increasingly diverse nation, with a wide and growing variety of cultures, beliefs and circumstances represented in the population. It is argued that to maintain the social health of such a diverse community Australia requires an equally wide variety of public stories to ensure that all sections of the community can find a suitable reflection of their lives and circumstances.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Narration (Rhetoric)</field><field name="subject">Storytelling</field><field name="subject">Mimesis in literature</field><field name="subject">Identity (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Values</field><field name="subject">Mass media</field><field name="subject">Books and reading</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/25033</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:25033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of leg pain ('Growing pains') in children aged four to six years</field><field name="creator">Evans, Angela M</field><field name="description">Growing pains has been reported in the medical literature since 1823 with frequent, subsequent and ongoing inclusion ever since.

However, the growing body of evidence in this area of research is predominantly quantitative. This study was designed to engage children in the five to six year age group using qualitative methods and present their notions of body image through the looking glass of the children's own eyes. Children's voices have not often found their way into research. Concerns about their powers of communication, cognitive abilities and the ethical difficulties inherent when working with children have restricted their participation. Objective, empirical evidence suggests that if one engages children in research appropriately they are able to make a significant contribution. Forty-seven children (25=m; 22=f) aged between five and six years were interviewed on three occasions over 12 months regarding their perceptions of body image. Seven schools from the Independent school system were involved. Interviews were conducted on school sites in public, easily observable locations. The study focused on three aspects. That is, how these children perceived their own body, the bodies of other people and their notions of health in respect to body image. These interviews revealed that the girls in this age group had developed an understanding of body image that valued thinness. However, their preference for a thinner body did not negatively impact on their sense of identity or self-worth. Boys preferred larger bodies and correlated increased body size with competence and physical aptitude. The concept of 'large' was linked to height for some or to a mesomorphic body for other boys. By the final interview all the children revealed strong negative perceptions of fatness. These perceptions were more apparent at each successive interview. An obese or extremely thin body was not always correlated with being unhealthy. Depending on the perspective of the child, even the largest of images was nominated the 'healthiest body' by some children. Health was overwhelmingly linked to food intake with few children associating health with exercise. The playground and the home, where most notably mothers, were important in the development of body image conceptions. Children were acutely aware of the dietary practices of their parents and associated diets with losing weight.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">symbolic interactionism</field><field name="subject">children's voices in research</field><field name="subject">Personality, Abilities and Assessment</field><field name="subject">early childhood</field><field name="subject">body image</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28294</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An account of courage in management decision making</field><field name="creator">Harris, Howard</field><field name="description">An account of the nature of courage and how it figures in  management decisions is developed on the basis of classical and contemporary literature in philosophy and management.

Its purpose is to investigate the nature of contemporary social divisions, and whether or not the ????underclass???? is a useful way of conceiving the social and economic marginalisation of some individuals. The underclass thesis crystallises in a powerful and contentious way some fundamental premises that underpin the neoliberal philosophy, namely that the welfare state is considered a threat to freedom, discourages work, and is socially and economically damaging. Thus there ought to be a reduced role for the state in the provision of welfare. There are two fundamental weaknesses in social democratic critics???? contributions to debates about welfare reform. The first relates to a focus on residual welfare and measurements of poverty, largely neglecting the systems of power that underlie welfare distribution. The second relates to the omission of agency. Critics???? responses have tended to ignore the behaviour of the welfare beneficiaries targeted by current reform. In order to address both of these issues, I have formulated a critical post-traditional paradigm of social divisions. The study comprises three stages. The first is an historical overview of neoliberal policy developments and a quantitative analysis of social divisions. The findings indicate that neoliberal nations have the lowest commitment to welfare, and the highest levels of poverty and widening inequality. In Australia, labour market changes and educational underachievement are likely to contribute to new and emerging divisions, and the cumulative nature of disadvantage is apparent within low socio-economic areas. The second stage of the study examines the policies of the Howard Coalition Government in Australia and focuses on the prevalence of the underclass phenomenon in current welfare reform. Records central to the Government????s welfare reform agenda are analysed to examine policy makers???? normative beliefs. The findings reveal that the underclass thesis is an ideological construct that legitimises a reduction of welfare provision and control of the unemployed. The third stage of the study focuses on the experiences of unemployment among young people, and the views and experiences of welfare providers who work with them. The data show that individuals make decisions about their lives from the range of options they perceive to be available to them at a particular point in time. These options are not limited to those made available by the provisions of the welfare state, nor are they solely the product of inter-generational welfare. The welfare providers enforce the Government????s position on welfare reform by endorsing a version of the underclass thesis in their work and directing their interventions at the individual. Considered together, the findings reveal that a conservative neoliberal social policy fails to capture the complex interaction that occurs between individuals and their social environment, and the impact this has on their labour market activities. By successfully converting the problem of welfare dependency into a private issue, a neoliberal social policy is legitimised and current social arrangements are maintained.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labour market</field><field name="subject">social policy</field><field name="subject">counselling, welfare and community services</field><field name="subject">young people</field><field name="subject">welfare providers</field><field name="subject">residualist conversion of social problems</field><field name="subject">critical theory</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28285</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of sulphide minerals: grinding media electrochemical interaction during grinding</field><field name="creator">Huang, Guozhi</field><field name="description">In this study the unique Magotteaux Mill&#174; system was used to control the grinding chemical conditions, which may be adjusted by varying grinding media, purging gas and pH, during grinding. An electrochemical apparatus was used to investigate oxidation-reduction behaviour of grinding media and sulphide mineral electrodes, as well as their galvanic interaction in-situ of the Magotteaux Mill&#174;. Galvanic interaction between the grinding media (mild steel, 15% chromium, 21% chromium and 30% chromium media) and the sulphide minerals (bornite, arsenopyrite and pyrite) was initially quantified in-situ of the mill by electrochemical techniques under different grinding atmospheres (nitrogen, air and oxygen). An innovative mathematical theoretical model was developed to describe the effect of galvanic interaction on oxidation rates of the grinding media during grinding, which was verified by the experimental data. Galvanic interaction enhanced the oxidation of the grinding media and produced more oxidized iron species in the mill discharge. It was observed that oxidized iron species (EDTA extractable iron) was linear with galvanic current between the grinding media and the sulphide minerals, in agreement with the prediction of the theoretical model. The effect of grinding conditions on pulp chemistry, surface properties and floatability was investigated by the measurement of dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, pulp potential (Eh), ethylene diamine-tetra acetic acid (EDTA) extraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and floatation recovery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">grinding</field><field name="subject">oxidation reduction</field><field name="subject">sulphide minerals</field><field name="subject">sulfide</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28362</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design of journals used for reflection</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Maureen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of reflective skills. Reflection has been recognised as a prime mode of creating knowledge for project managers. Reflection literature indicates that reflective skills do not develop naturally; guidance, encouragement and facilitation is usually required for managers to reach their highest learning potential. Among the tools suggested to aid this development are written project journals. While there has been research on some aspects of journals, there was little found on the design of reflective journals relevant to developing project management reflection skills. This study has examined the effect or influence of various designs of reflective journals on different facets of reflective learning. The research question was: ????Are there facets of reflection that can be influenced by journal design????? Evidence for the study was first gathered through literature then from journal content and interviews. Literature on reflective learning revealed the facets relevant to the study: definition of reflection, consequences, emotions, temporal factors and individual and organisational culture. Issues identified in journal literature that needed to be applied to the study of reflection development included the journal audience, assessment and format. Participants in the study were final year undergraduates and Masters students who worked on industry based projects over several months. They were requested to keep journals for the duration of the projects, to submit them for examination and then asked to offer feedback on the various journal designs on completion of the projects. The research was conducted over four years, through seven projects, with thirty students taking part. The journal design went through six modifications. The primary findings from the study were: the majority of participants followed the predicted development hierarchy of reflective development; development of reflective skills is dependent on individual and organisational culture; audience does have an impact on reporting of and reflection on concerns; and journal design can facilitate development of some levels of reflection but has no influence on the development of critical reflection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Philosophy of Mind (excl.

This research is significant for several reasons: (a) the relative lack of research into pricing behaviour and price transmission in Asia-Pacific, (b) the development of new tools to analyse non linear cointegration and hence price asymmetry, (c) economic and financial convergence is now a topic of regional importance, (d) transmission and price behaviour evidence has not been documented in the context of the different central bank policy signaling regimes evident in the region, (e) the banking markets in the region are clearly in the midst of a consolidation and globalisation phase. This follows rapidly from the 1997/98 financial-crisis, (f) there is little evidence in the region of how advances in risk management practice have impacted the price behaviour of the banking industry. A number of findings have been documented. Regional financial integration appears already under way, evidenced by both regional banking mergers and regional consistency in the timing of structural breaks during the Asian crisis. Transmission of policy rates to wholesale rates appears rapid in the case of Hong Kong (HK) and New Zealand (NZ), but slow in the case of Singapore with its currency-basket regime. Generally, there is little evidence of asymmetric interest rate pricing practices in Singapore and HK, whilst asymmetry noted for NZ appears to be largely a function of how banks reacted in a significant decline in rates over a long period prior to the implementation of the Official Cash Rate.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340208 Macroeconomics (incl.

The research is situated within a postmodern, postcolonial world and is influenced significantly by the work of Foucault ([1972] 2003), Fairclough (1989; 1992), Said (1995 [1978]) and Cherryholmes (1988). The portfolio consists of three related research reports and a meta-analysis which both connects these individual reports and conducts further analysis of the issues and themes arising from the research. The literature reviewed in Research Report 1 describes a range of approaches to internationalisation and issues associated with its definition and implementation in universities. It is concluded that internationalisation in higher education is part of a network of constantly developing and changing discourses all of which both influence and are influenced by political, social and economic contexts and agendas. The nature of the discourse of internationalisation at UniSA and the power/knowledge relations which are embedded within and support it are the focus of the second research report which consists of a critical discourse analysis of a corpus of documents related to internationalisation and Graduate Quality #7 at UniSA. Five discourses of internationalisation at UniSA are identified and the roles associated with the primary subjects of the discourse (academic staff, Australian students and international students) are described. Significant shifts in the discursive construction of internationalisation at UniSA over time are also identified, including the tendency for the economic discourse to be viewed as dominant and the associated ideology to be naturalised.  The third research report consists of &#226;&#8364;&#732;snapshots&#226;&#8364;&#8482; of the experience of internationalisation in different places and from different perspectives. It strives for a deeper understanding of the complexity of internationalisation at UniSA through exploration of the construction of Graduate Quality #7 (that students of UniSA will develop international perspectives as professionals and citizens) in two different cultural and educational contexts &#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189;&#239;&#191;&#189; Adelaide and Hong Kong. The research highlights the need to embed and integrate intercultural learning into the culture of UniSA &#226;&#8364;&#8220; to assist all staff and all students to move into uncomfortable intercultural spaces; to learn from and with each other within those spaces; to challenge their stereotypes and prejudices and to move on from them.  The three reports are drawn together in the meta-analysis which concludes that although there are signs of ideological struggle within the discourse of internationalisation, the constructions of internationalisation and its subjects and actors at UniSA and beyond are consistent with a construction of internationalisation as a neo-colonialist activity. It suggests a modified approach to internationalisation &#226;&#8364;&#8220; one that challenges the stereotypes and hegemonies currently associated with it. This has implications for the focus of professional development and student services to support internationalisation at UniSA and other Australian universities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">309902 Education and Extension</field><field name="subject">330104 Educational Policy, Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">330199 Education Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">330299 Curriculum Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">330305 Teacher Education: Higher Education</field><field name="subject">330399 Professional Development of Teachers not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">330304 Teacher Education: Vocational Education and Training</field><field name="subject">internationalisation</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">transnational teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emulsion droplets of controlled deformability: electrokinetics, colloid stability and polymer adsorption</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Timothy</field><field name="description">Emulsions are commonly found both in nature and industry.

The subjects are university students studying Japanese at two levels, elementary and intermediate, either as their major or as an elective in south-east Queensland, Australia. It was assumed that there are many motivational variables, such as the purpose of study, the strength of commitment, their attitudes towards the target language and languages in general, their cultural/linguistic backgrounds, their interest in Japanese language and culture, gender, and the learning environment, which may affect learners&#226;?? persistence differently, depending on their level of study. Questionnaires were used as a tool to collect data and were conducted twice, at the beginning and at the end of their course of study. Learners&#226;?? motivational traits were examined from the data in accordance with their intention of continuing or discontinuing the study to the next semester. The results show that motivation is not something fixed in the learners&#226;?? minds, but may change during the process of learning, and that motivational factors vary according to levels of language proficiency. Based on the findings, this study claims five major points: 1) learners&#226;?? sustaining motivation which is based on students&#226;?? continuous appraisal of their learning events may be important for their persistence/termination decision making, 2) one of the most important factors which affect sustaining motivation is the students&#226;?? sense of investment in their Japanese language study, 3) development of the culture-based intrinsic interest in Japanese may work strongly for the investment, and learning environment, especially foreign language learning environment, may play a significant role for students&#226;?? investment, 4) a large gap between learners&#226;?? self-efficacy and the demands of real study weakens their motivation, which often leads to the termination of their study, especially at the elementary level, and 5) students&#226;?? cultural/linguistic distance from Japanese, educational background, and gender may affect their sustaining motivation, thus, they perform differently with regard to their persistence in Japanese as a foreign language study in Australian context.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Psychology</field><field name="subject">Gender Specific Studies</field><field name="subject">Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">Japanese language</field><field name="subject">linguistic/cultural distance</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/29570</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emotional dimension of educational change: the staff experience of implementing problem-based learning</field><field name="creator">King, Sharron</field><field name="description">This interpretive study investigated the process of radical change for a collaborative team of investigators in an allied health school at the University of South Australia. Specifically, it investigated the process of developing and implementing a fully-integrated problem-based learning curriculum across the entire undergraduate curriculum for the School of Medical Radiation. The study examined the richness and complexity of the change process for this team of educators over a two year time period. The research builds on understandings of change derived from three main bodies of literature: the school-based educational change literature; the problem-based learning literature; and the organisational change literature. It interweaves knowledge gained from each of these areas to develop a new perspective from which to consider radical educational change in higher education. Much of the previous research into change ignores the participant experience, and particularly the emotional dimension of this experience. This study redresses that gap by exploring the human dimension of the change process. This study has provided an authentic and inclusive representation of participants' experience of radical educational change. It has shown that participants not only undergo considerable cognitive dissonance when implementing major change, they also undergo significant emotional dissonance. Thus, if we are to improve the outcomes of educational innovation, we need to develop change management practices that not only recognise but also support the emotional dimension of the change process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Higher Education</field><field name="subject">Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="subject">Other Education</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">problem-based learning</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">insider research</field><field name="subject">paramedical education</field><field name="subject">curriculum planning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/29578</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">professional ethics for professional nursing</field><field name="creator">Kalaitzidis, Evdokia</field><field name="description">The thesis proposes and defends a maxim which can serve as a foundation and guideline for professional ethics in nursing, the maxim that nurses should act so far as possible to promote patient's self-determination.

These component systems are typically largely managed independently of one another. They each have their own intrinsic goals which they are capable of fulfilling autonomously. These goals are additional to any to which they might contribute as part of the overall System-of-Systems that is being investigated. Systems-of-Systems are epitomised by features such as the prevalence of complex webs of mutual interdependency amongst their component systems, the involvement of a broad diversity of stakeholders and the participation of a number of independent decision-makers, each of whom competes with the others for strictly limited resources. Furthermore, the components of Systems-of-Systems may often be found to be widely scattered across an extensive geographical region. Sometimes such systems may even span global distances. Complex Systems-of-Systems of such a nature would appear to be becoming ever more prevalent in the increasingly interconnected and ever shrinking world which is engendered, in particular, by the proliferation of modern information and communication technology. Systems-of-Systems may arise in both commercial and public sector contexts, hence commercial organisations and governments, alike, confront the daunting challenge of planning, establishing and maintaining novel systems of this type. However, it is to be anticipated that significant difficulties might be encountered in applying existing systems engineering methods, which were designed for dealing with far more monolithic types of system, to the treatment of Systems-of- Systems. Instead, the successful achievement of acceptable resolutions to the various Systems-of-Systems issues and conundrums with which the responsible planners can be expected to be confronted would appear to demand the application of sophisticated distributed decision aids, in order to alleviate the the intolerable burden which the decision-makers would otherwise be forced to endure. Such aids need to be able to take a genuinely fair and unbiased account of the interests of a multitude of stakeholders. At the same time, they must be able to satisfactorily accommodate the enforcement of a range of highly involved and intricate constraints upon the various alternative interventions which might potentially be contemplated. In order to underpin the development of decision aids of the kind demanded, it has been sought to establish some basic theoretical foundations for Systems-of-Systems. This body of theory has then been applied to the identification of the methods which might be most suitable for the treatment of Systems-of-Systems questions. Finally, some decision-support tools which are intended to facilitate the implementation of the methods that have been recommended have been described. Any attempt to dictate a single &#226;??best&#226;?? intervention to the decision-makers would generally be totally unacceptable. As a result, the objective which has been pursued has been to seek to filter out and identify a relatively sparing number of what would appear to be the most reasonable alternatives from some much more profuse range of possibilities. These may then be afforded more intensive scrutiny by the pertinent decision-makers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dynamical Systems</field><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Systems Theory and Control</field><field name="subject">Decision Support and Group Support Systems</field><field name="subject">Systems Theory</field><field name="subject">Other Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">complex systems</field><field name="subject">systems-of-systems</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/30414</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between froth recovery and froth structure</field><field name="creator">Schwarz, Sarah</field><field name="description">The flotation process has been used and extensively researched over the past 100 years; however some aspects still remain a great mystery.

For example, travellers could be struck walking to/from or boarding/alighting a bus. At these locations, passengers become pedestrians and at some stage crossing busy arterial roads at the bus stop in areas or at objects of main attraction usually outside of pedestrian designated facilities such as signal controlled intersections, zebra and pelican crossings. Pedestrian exposure to risk or risk-taking occurs when people want to cross the road in front of the stopped bus, at the rear of the bus or between the buses, particularly where bus stops are located on two-way roads (i.e. within the mid-block of the road with side streets, at non-signalised cross-section). However, it is necessary to have a better understanding of the pedestrian road-crossing risk exposure (pedestrian crossing distraction, obscurity and behaviour) within bus stop zones so that it can be incorporated into new design, bus stop placement, and evaluation of traffic management schemes where bus stop locations will play an increasingly important role. A full range of possible incidental interactions are presented in a tabular model that looks at the most common interacting traffic movements within bus stop zones. The thesis focused on pedestrian safety, discusses theoretical foundations of bus stops, and determines the types of accident risks between bus travellers as pedestrians and motor vehicles within the zones of the bus stop. Thus, the objectives of this thesis can be summarized as follows: (I) - Classification of bus stops, particularly according to objects of main attraction (pedestrian-generating activities); (II) - Analysis of traffic movement and interactions as an accident/risk exposure in the zone of bus stops with respect to that structure; (III) - Categorizing traffic accident in the vicinity of bus stops, and to analyse the interactions (interacting movements) that occur within bus stop zones in order to discover the nature of problems; (IV) - Formulation of tabular (pedestrian traffic accident prediction) models/forms (based on traffic interactions that creating and causing possibilities of accident conflict) for practical statistical methods of those accidents related to bus stop, and; (V) - Safety aspects related to the micro-location of bus stops to assist in the micro-location design, operations of bus stop safety facilities and safer pedestrian crossing for access between the bus stop and nearby objects of attraction. The scope of this thesis focuses on the theoretical foundation of bus stop micro&#226;??location in areas of main attractions or at objects of main attraction, and traffic accident risk types as they occur between travellers as pedestrians and vehicle flow in the zone of the bus stop. The knowledge of possible interactions leads to the identification of potential conflict situations between motor vehicles and pedestrians. The problems discussed for each given conflict situation, has a great potential in increasing the knowledge needed to prevent accidents and minimise any pedestrian-vehicle conflict in this area and to aid in the development and planning of safer bus stops.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transportation not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Civil Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Transport Engineering</field><field name="subject">Data Storage Representations</field><field name="subject">Simulation and Modelling</field><field name="subject">bus stops</field><field name="subject">pedestrian safety</field><field name="subject">traffic safety</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28389</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the agrocin 84 plasmid of `Agrobacterium radiobacter`</field><field name="creator">Shim, Je-Seop.</field><field name="description">Includes two journal articles with contributions by the author Bibliography: leaves 145-154</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Pathogenic bacteria</field><field name="subject">Crown-gall disease</field><field name="subject">Plasmids</field><field name="subject">Insertion elements, DNA</field><field name="subject">Rhizobiaceae Biological control</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phs5565.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:5751534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">South Australia's national parks system : visitor perceptions and park resources</field><field name="creator">Aslin, H.

Opportunities are few for differentiating one service provider from another. In the light of prior research suggesting value is multi-dimensional, the present study, which examines how these dimensions impact customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions, provides differentiation opportunities for mobile service providers through focusing on value dimensions that are important to customers. Of six perceived value dimensions examined in the present research, value for money, reputation and social value dimensions had significant effects on customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. One way for companies in the highly commoditized mobile service industry to minimize customer defection is to enhance their relationships with customers. However, as relationship building comes with a cost, it is of interest for companies to know whether certain customer groups will reciprocate more than others with loyalty if they are satisfied. The results from the present study show customer relationship inclination, the customer attribute examined, did not moderate the relationship between customer satisfaction and repurchase intention. Finally, recent studies have differentiated measures of repurchase intentions on the basis of volition levels and have suggested that better model fit can be achieved when higher volition measures are used. Intentions-as-expectations represents the lower volition end and intentions-as-wants represents the higher volition end of intention measure. However, the present study did not find any significant differences in model fit with the different intention measures used.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular telephone services industry -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Customer relations</field><field name="subject">Customer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">Motivation research (Marketing)</field><field name="subject">Behavioural intentions</field><field name="subject">Structural equation modelling</field><field name="subject">Perceived value</field><field name="subject">Satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptual aftereffects reveal dissociable adaptive coding of faces of different races and sexes</field><field name="creator">Jaquet, Emma</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Recent studies have provided evidence that face-coding mechanisms reference a norm or average face (Leopold, O`Toole, Vetter &amp; Blanz, 2001; Rhodes &amp; Jeffery, 2006). The central aim of this thesis was to establish whether distinct norms, and dissociable neural mechanisms code faces of different race and sex categories. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to norm based coding of faces, and reviews evidence for the existence of distinct norms for different races and sexes. Chapter 1 then introduces adaptation as a tool for investigating these ideas. Chapter 2 presents two adaptation studies that examined how faces of different races are coded. The aim of these studies was to determine whether dissociable neural mechanisms (or distinct face norms) code faces of different races. Chinese and Caucasian participants rated the normality of Caucasian and Chinese test faces, before and after adaptation to distorted faces of one race (e.g., 'contracted' Chinese faces; Experiment 1) or distorted faces of both races (e.g., 'contracted' Chinese faces and 'expanded' Caucasian faces; Experiment 2). Following adaptation to faces of one race, there were changes in perceived normality for faces of both races (i.e., perceptual aftereffects), indicating that common neural mechanisms code Chinese and Caucasian faces. However, aftereffects were significantly smaller in faces of the unadapted race suggesting some sensitivity to the race of faces. This sensitivity was also evident in Experiment 2. ... Some dissociability was also found in the coding of faces of different iv sexes. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants adapted to oppositely distorted faces of both sexes. Weak sex-selective aftereffects were found. Taken together, the findings suggest that male and female faces are coded by dissociable but not completely distinct neural populations. Chapter 4 examined whether the aftereffects reported for faces of different races or sexes reflected the adaptation of high-level neural mechanisms tuned to the social category information in faces, or earlier coding mechanisms tuned to simple physical differences between face groups. Chinese and Caucasian participants adapted to oppositely distorted face sets that were the same distance apart on a morph continua. The face sets were either from different race categories (e.g., contracted Chinese faces and expanded Caucasian faces), or from the same race category, (e.g., contracted Chinese faces and expanded caricatured Chinese faces). Larger opposite aftereffects were found when face sets were from different race categories, than when they were from the same race category suggesting that oppositely adapted neural mechanisms are tuned to social category differences rather than simple physical differences in faces. Together, these studies shed new light on how we code faces from different face categories. Specifically, the findings indicate that faces of different races and sexes are coded by both common and race- or sex-selective neural mechanisms. In addition, the findings are consistent with the possibility that race- and sex-selective norms and dimensions are used to code faces in face space. The implications of these findings and possible avenues for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Face perception</field><field name="subject">Recognition (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Visual perception</field><field name="subject">Face perception</field><field name="subject">Adaptation and aftereffects</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal constructs on resilience in swimming</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Timothy</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Resilience is a concept that originated from behavioural science; a branch of research aimed at explaining unexpected benign or malignant outcomes associated with human development. It is a psychological construct that encompasses both cognitive and behavioural responses to negative situations and appears to exist at both an individual and group level. As a concept, resilience receives considerable attention from researchers within developmental psychology fields, who primarily identify numerous risk and protective factors. Within sport, however, researchers have demonstrated a preference for the examination of more traditional concepts, such as coping strategies. Moreover, few investigations in either domain employ a cogent theoretical framework to guide the research. Therefore, the present research program utilises Personal Construct Psychology (PCP; Kelly, 1955) principles to direct the proposed research. PCP is a theory about theories that emphasised our underlying ambition to make sense of the world, the events people encounter and themselves. According to Kelly, PCP is guided by the fundamental postulate and 11 corollaries. The PCP research template employed by the current research program promotes the utilisation of multimethod designs (i.e., qualitative and quantitative investigations) in order to understand and facilitate the development of resilience in swimming. Three research investigations are proposed to examine resilience in swimming, and are structured according to PCP. Each investigation is outlined below. Study 1. An interview protocol based upon key elements of Kelly s (1955) psychotherapy retrospective interview protocol was employed to elicit an understanding of resilience in swimming. Fourteen interviews were scheduled with elite Australian swimmers and swimming coaches, utilising the interview schedule. ... Study 3. The aim of this study was to design, implement and evaluate a resilience intervention for youth swimmers. Utilising the data generated from the first study, a resilience enhancement program was designed and delivered to 16 developmental swimmers over a period of three months. Resilience was measured pre, during and post intervention, and three months after the intervention. Resilience was also measured on an age and ability matched control group (n = 20), at the same time points. Results revealed improvements in resilience for the experimental group following the completion of the resilience program. In summary, the present research program employed a PCP (Kelly, 1955) research template to guide the aforementioned studies of resilience. The data collected from the research investigations contributed considerable knowledge to the resilience concept, and the sport psychology field. The qualitative study was the first of its kind to examine the concept in swimming, revealing several elements and process pertaining to resilience that later formed the foundations for the resilience intervention. General conclusions propose that future research combine psychological measurement of resilience and more traditional sport psychology concepts, in addition to the development of a sport specific psychometric measure of resilience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Personal construct theory</field><field name="subject">Swimming -- Psychological Aspects</field><field name="subject">Swimming -- Training</field><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Swimming</field><field name="subject">Personal construct psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The good old way revisited : the Ferrar family of Little Gidding c.1625-1637</field><field name="creator">Riley, Kate E.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The Ferrars are remembered as exemplars of Anglican piety. The London merchant family quit the city in 1625 and moved to the isolated manor of Little Gidding in Huntingdonshire. There they pursued a life of corporate devotion, supervised by the head of the household, Nicholas Ferrar, until he died in December 1637. To date, the life of the pious deacon Nicholas Ferrar has been the focus of histories of Little Gidding, which are conventionally hagiographical and give little consideration to the experiences of other members of the family, not least the many women in the household. Further, customary representations of the Ferrars have tended to remove them from their seventeenth-century context. Countering the biographical trend that has obscured many details of their communal life, this thesis provides a new, critical reading of the family's years at Little Gidding while Nicholas Ferrar was alive. It examines the Ferrars in terms of their own time, as far as possible using contemporary documents instead of later accounts and confessional mythology. It shows that, while certain aspects of life at Little Gidding were unusual, on the whole the family was less exceptional than traditional histories have implied; certainly the family was not so unified and unworldly as the idealised images have suggested. Moreover, the Ferrars were actively engaged in making those images, for immediate effect and for posterity. The Ferrars' identities, corporate and individual, and their largely textual practices of self-fashioning are central to the study. Other key concerns are the Ferrars' moral and religious ideals and practices, gender in the family, and intra-familial relationships. Evidence for the thesis is drawn from family documents dating from the early years of the seventeenth century to the time of Nicholas Ferrar's death. ... The Little Academy is considered first: in this unique dialogue circle, young women discussed morally edifying historical tales, offering them a textually-mediated experience of the world and working to reinforce conventional gender roles and religious values. The final three chapters pertain to the copious and little-studied family correspondence. A chapter that develops a theory of the functions of the family correspondence network is followed by one studying the affective relationships that the celibate sisters Mary and Anna Collet maintained through their letters with their unmarried uncle and spiritual mentor, Nicholas Ferrar. These chapters consider the identities as single people that all three developed through these relationships, within the maritally-focused framework of the Protestant family. The last chapter also concerns the lives of the unmarried, examining the relationships of single male adults and their roles in the family, focusing on the friendship of Nicholas Ferrar and his cousin Arthur Woodnoth. The thesis closes by reflecting on the fact that returning the Ferrars to their seventeenth-century context reveals their multi-faceted nature, comprising ideals and identities sometimes incongruous with one another, and certainly unaccounted for in the traditional narratives. It thus demonstrates the importance of the overall project of reconceiving the Ferrars? history, which forms an original contribution to the study of the social, cultural and religious history of early seventeenth-century England.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Little Gidding</field><field name="subject">Families of clergy</field><field name="subject">Sex role</field><field name="subject">England -- Social life and customs -- 17th century</field><field name="subject">Ferrar, Nicholas, -- 1592-1637</field><field name="subject">Ferrar family</field><field name="subject">English history</field><field name="subject">Seventeenth century England</field><field name="subject">Family and gender</field><field name="subject">Early modern religion</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making the frontier manifest : the representation of American politics in new age literature</field><field name="creator">Ellery, Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the history of the New Age movement through a political analysis of influential New Age books. By drawing upon cultural, religious and American studies, and concepts from literary criticism and political science, a new understanding of the movement becomes possible. This thesis analyses the ideological representations and rhetorical strategies employed in both New Age literature and American presidential discourse. It is argued that their shared imagery and discursive features indicate that New Age writings derive their ideological underpinnings and textual devices from dominant beliefs of American nationalism. This historical examination begins with the Cold War in the late 1940s and ends with the 1990s. Each chapter traces parallels between a particular presidential discourse and New Age texts published in the same decade commencing with Dwight D. Eisenhower and The Doors of Perception and finishing with William J. Clinton and The Celestine Prophecy: An Adventure. It argues that the appropriation of particular spiritualities in New Age texts is closely related to contemporary American geo-political interests and understandings. Major New Age spiritual trends are derived from regions, most often in the third world, which are considered to be under threat from forces such as Communism. New Age writings construct an imaginary possession of these worlds, reconfiguring these sites into frontiers of American influence. In particular, this study examines the influence of the jeremiads and the ensuing Monroe Doctrine and Manifest Destiny ideologies upon post-war national beliefs and the extent to which these understandings of nationalism inform New Age discourse. Representations of time and space, destiny and landscape, and self and other in these literary and political contexts are analysed. From this perspective, the eclecticism that marks the New Age can be historically understood as a shifting cultural expression of Cold War and post-Cold War political responses. Consequently, New Age literature is one of the means by which dominant American identity is reproduced and disseminated in what seems to be an alternative spiritual context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Age movement -- United States</field><field name="subject">New Age movement -- Political aspects</field><field name="subject">Politics and culture -- United States</field><field name="subject">Other (Philosophy) in literature</field><field name="subject">Nationalism and literature -- United States</field><field name="subject">United States -- Politics and government -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">New age</field><field name="subject">Race and gender ideology</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">American literature</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Divorce, gender, and state and social power : an investigation of the impact of the 1974 Indonesian marriage law</field><field name="creator">O'Shaughnessy, Kate Elizabeth</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The 1974 Indonesian Marriage Law required all divorces to be ratified by courts and vested household leadership with husbands.

The region contains a high number of endemic species, ranging from Gondwanan relicts to more recently evolved plant and animal species. Biogeographic models developed primarily for plants suggest a prominent role of Quaternary climatic fluctuations in the rampant speciation of endemic plants. Those models were not based on explicit spatial analysis of genetic structure, did not estimate divergence dates and may be a poor predictor of patterns in endemic vertebrates. Myobatrachid frogs have featured heavily in the limited investigations of the biogeography of the regions fauna. Myobatrachid frogs are diverse in southwestern Australia, and while we know they have speciated in situ, we know little about the temporal and spatial patterning of speciation events. In order to gain insight into the biogeographic history and potential speciation patterns of Myobatrachid frogs in the southwest I conducted a comparative phylogeography of four frog species spanning three life history strategies. I aimed to: 1) assess the biogeographic history of individual species, 2) determine where patterns of regional diversity exist using a comparative framework, 3) determine whether congruent patterns across species enable the development of explicit biogeographic hypotheses for frogs, and 4) compare patterns of diversity in plants with the models I developed for frogs. I conducted fine-scale intraspecific phylogeographies on four species. ...  Geocrinia leai: deep divergences, coincident with late Miocene arid onset, divide this species into western and southeast coastal lineages, with a third only found within the Shannon-Gardner River catchments. Phylogeographic history within each lineage has been shaped by climatic fluctuations from the Pliocene through to the present. Arenophryne shows the first evidence of geological activity in speciation of a Shark Bay endemic. Divergence patterns between the High Rainfall and Southeast Coastal Provinces within C. georgiana are consistent with patterns between Litoria moorei and L. cyclorhynchus and plant biogeographic regions. Subdivision between drainage systems along the southern coast (in M. nichollsi, G. leai and the G. rosea species complex) reflect the relative importance of distinct catchments as refuges during arid maxima, similarly the northern Darling Escarpment is identified as a potential refugium (C. georgiana and G. leai). Divergences in Myobatrachid frogs are far older than those inferred for plants with the late Miocene apparently an important time for speciation of southwestern frogs. Speciation of Myobatrachids broadly relates to the onset of aridity in Australia in the late Miocene, with the exception of earlier/contemporaneous geological activity in Arenophryne. The origins of subsequent intraspecific phylogeographic structure are coincident with subsequent climatic fluctuations and correlated landscape evolution. Divergence within frogs in the forest system may be far older than the Pleistocene models developed for plants because of the heavy reliance on wet systems by relictual frog species persisting in the southwestern corner of Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biogeography -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Frogs -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Myobatrachidae -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Phylogeography -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Biogeography</field><field name="subject">Frogs</field><field name="subject">Southwestern Australia</field><field name="subject">Phylogeography</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating models of verbal serial short-term memory using temporal grouping phenomena</field><field name="creator">Ng, Li Huang Honey</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Various capabilities such as the ability to read or conduct a conversation rely on our ability to maintain and recall information in the correct order. Research spanning more than a century has been devoted to understanding how units of information are retained in order in short-term memory. The nature of the mechanisms that code the positions of items in serial short-term verbal recall can be investigated by examining a set of phenomena that can be termed temporal grouping effects. Inserting extended pauses to break a list of verbal items into sub-lists (e.g. SHD-QNR-BJF, where the dashes represents the pauses) improves the accuracy of serial recall relative to performance observed without this temporal grouping. In addition, two other effects are linked to temporal grouping. One of these effects is a shift in the shape of the serial position function, which changes from a single bowed function to a multiple-bowed function. That is, the serial position curve for ungrouped sequences is typically characterized by better performance for the beginning and ending items compared to the mid-list items. For grouped lists, the multiple-bowed function comprises better recall for the beginning and ending items within each group. Another effect associated with temporal grouping is a change in the patterns of order errors. For ungrouped sequences (e.g. SHDQNRBJF), order errors often involve the swapping of items in neighbouring positions, such as exchanging D for Q or R for B. By contrast, grouped sequences (such as SHD-QNR-BJF) show a reduction in order errors that cross group boundaries such as exchanging items D and Q or R and B; instead, there tend to be an increased incidence of exchanging items that share similar within-group positions such as swapping H and N or Q and B. According to several current models of short-term memory, items are retained by associating them with extra-list information such as contextual information. ... This was done by unconfounding temporal position (time from group onset) and ordinal position (number of items from group onset) for certain key items in sequences comprising two groups of four consonants. The critical manipulation was to vary the SOAs within and across the two groups. Errors that involve items migrating across groups should preserve within-group temporal position according to oscillator models, but should preserve within-group ordinal position according to non-oscillator models. Results from the intergroup errors strongly favored preservation of ordinal rather than temporal position. Finally, the Appendix reports an unpublished experiment that examined patterns of errors in recalling sequences of nine visually presented letters, where the letters were grouped into threes using temporal gaps. A critical manipulation was the insertion of a tobe- ignored item (an asterisk) between the first and second letters of selected groups. Inclusion of this item failed to alter the patterns of errors observed, indicating that the coding of serial position is based on only those events represented for recall. The central conclusion based on all the studies is that serial order for verbal items is retained using contextual positional codes that change with each presentation of a tobe- remembered item, are influenced by large temporal gaps that lead to grouping, but otherwise are not dependent on the timing of events.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Short-term memory</field><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Short-term memory</field><field name="subject">Verbal memory</field><field name="subject">Working memory</field><field name="subject">Temporal grouping</field><field name="subject">Temporal oscillators</field><field name="subject">Serial order</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fellow (novel) ; and Australian historical fiction, debating the perceived past (dissertation)</field><field name="creator">Penazzi, Leonardo</field><field name="description">Novel The Fellow What is knowledge?

Matt, a graduate architect from Perth, Australia, finds himself increasingly vulnerable to cultural confusion as he adjusts to life away from his home and friends. Having initially assumed that Seoul's western facade echoes its social dynamic, Matt increasingly discovers that the Confucianism which underpins much of contemporary Korean society makes all relationships far more complex than his assumptions had allowed. Together with a Canadian student who is seeking to find the essence of a different Korea through her investigation of Buddhism, and through meeting diverse Korean characters, readers will discover several of the many facets of contemporary Korean culture. Readers will be encouraged to test the slippery surfaces on which familiar and unfamiliar attitudes to bodies, landscape and created spaces rest. 'Body, Space, Ideas of Home: Cross-cultural Perspectives' (thesis) The thesis examines the interaction of body space, architectural space, landscape, and emotional states in contemporary literary fiction from several cultural perspectives. Bodies, landscapes, and architectural spaces are shown to be devices through which contemporary authors with different cultural backgrounds have expressed character and explored ideas, especially thematic concerns related to cultural or cross-cultural confusion or understanding. Notions of 'feeling at home' and 'being alien' are investigated through the work of authors who either have a cross-cultural heritage (e.g. Jhumpa Lahiri a Bengali/American), or who write about a culture which is not their own (e.g. Dianne Highbridge, an Australian writing about Japan). Several chosen authors explore the relationships between the spiritual and the physical, the metaphysical and the corporeal. These elements are particularly highlighted when examining the narratives of Tim Winton (The Riders, 1994) and Simone Lazaroo (The World Waiting To Be Made, 1994); and two of Japan's most popular writers, Haruki Murakami (Norwegian Wood, 2000) and Banana Yoshimoto (Lizard, 1995). For some writers, this exploration of spaces forms the focal point of their work; for others, it is an important facet of their narrative world, which helps to ground their writing for contemporary readers whose own backgrounds must also influence their understandings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian fiction -- 21st century</field><field name="subject">Characters and characteristics in literature</field><field name="subject">Home in literature</field><field name="subject">Landscape in literature</field><field name="subject">Architecture in literature</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism in literature</field><field name="subject">Novel -- English -- Australia -- 21st century -- Texts</field><field name="subject">Korea (South) -- In literature</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">Korean perspectives of Australia</field><field name="subject">Ideas of home</field><field name="subject">Australian perceptions of Korea</field><field name="subject">Cultural perspectives on writing</field><field name="subject">Bodies and spaces in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trotsky's analysis of Stalinism : an historical assessment</field><field name="creator">Milner, Graham K</field><field name="description">Leon Trotsky (1879-1940) remains one of the most controversial figures in twentieth century history. There is no consensus about his character or historical achievements-as either thinker or actor. To Winston Churchill, writing in the 1930s, Trotsky was a 'cancer bacillus'. The Stalinist anathema placed on him is well-known. For Tony Cliff, a contemporary socialist writer, on the other hand, Trotsky was a 'man of genius'.  Whatever assessment may be made about Trotsky, one of his lesser biographers and critics makes the point fairly enough that 'compared to his famous colleagues, Lenin and Stalin, Trotsky has been sorely neglected by historians and other scholars'. The upheaval in the USSR and its successor state system, and in Eastern Europe and China, since the mid-1980s, when CPSU General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev launched his programme of radical change under the sobriquets 'glasnost' and 'perestroika', has brought into the foreground once again the historical issues concerning the origins, character and consequences of the Stalinist system of 'totalitarian' political rule with its attendant hyper-centralised command economy. The whole experience of Stalinism has been, and no doubt will continue to be, subjected to intensive historical reconsideration as Russian scholars in particular seek to come to terms with the October Revolution and its legacy within the context of their national past. The publication of some of Trotsky's writings in Russian language editions and their circulation within the territories of the Russian Federation makes available an assessment and analysis of the Stalinist experience previously denied to the Russian reader. It is against this background that the author has written an historical review of Trotsky's major writings on the question of Stalinism in the Soviet Union. The approach adopted utilizes a combination of chronological exposition and analytical commentary, in the belief that both of these aspects of historical writing are necessary and valid. As Arthur Marwick has commented: '... if history without analysis is meaningless, without chronology it does not exist'. Marxist ideas have had a wide currency in the century and the contribution to the body of Marxist doctrine and theory by Leon Trotsky deserves closer attention. This study of Trotsky's attempt to make a Marxist analysis and assessment of the experience of Stalinism in the Soviet Union has been carried through in the belief that the examination of the critical and minority current within the broader mainstream of the international socialist movement has much to offer in contributing to our knowledge and understanding of the one of the most significant developments in twentieth century political history. A critical and historical assessment of Trotsky's analysis of Stalinism makes a contribution both to our appreciation of Trotsky's ideas and to our understanding of a phenomenon which looms large in any discussion of the broader contours of twentieth century history.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stalin, Joseph, -- 1879-1953</field><field name="subject">Trotsky, Leon, -- 1879-1940</field><field name="subject">Communism -- Soviet Union -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Soviet Union -- Politics and government -- 1917-1936</field><field name="subject">Soviet Union -- Politics and government -- 1936-1953</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal identity and concern for future selves</field><field name="creator">Pickering, Phillip</field><field name="description">In this thesis I will argue that it is irrational to anticipate the future. I do not claim that the future will not exist, but rather that our current selves will never experience that future. Support for this seemingly implausible thesis begins when consider the problems posed by personal identity puzzle cases. When we consider hypothetical cases such as fission, where one existing person will divide into two future people (for example through brain transplants or teletransportation), we instinctively wonder which of the two post-fission bodies the pre-fission person would 'wake up' in. Could it be the case that our subject of experience does not in fact 'go' anywhere? I initially consider the interdependency between personal identity and the displacement of our current selves into the past or future. Ultimately, I will argue that self displacement is not based on personal identity, but rather the reverse  that is, that personal identity is based on our hard-wired tendency to displace our current selves into the past or future. I then present the crux of my argument, that it is irrational to anticipate the future. I will do this by presenting cases in which it is clearly irrational to anticipate 'waking up' in a certain body and demonstrating that these cases are comparable to 'waking up' in the same physically or psychologically continuous body. Contrary to our most deeply held beliefs, it is not rational to expect that our present subject of experience will somehow be there in the future. This astonishing conclusion removes our most obvious reason for concern about future selves. I will argue that if this conclusion is correct, we have relatively weak reasons for prudential concern about the future. One of the key objectives of this thesis will therefore be to determine whether it is rational for our current self to be concerned about a future self that it will never experience being. I will show that if we are irrational to anticipate the future, then we must radically rethink the sort of prudential concern we have for our future selves. I argue that our reasons to be concerned about future selves are much weaker than (or at least very different than) those we might have originally imagined. I will also show that it is not against reason to be unconcerned about future selves, unless we believe that we are morally obliged to be concerned for all future people.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Mind and body</field><field name="subject">Self (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">&lt;keyword&gt;</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of surfactant production by fetal type II pneumocytes and the characterization of fibroblast-pneumocyte factor.</field><field name="creator">G.Maker@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The fetal lung undergoes extensive physiological and biochemical maturation prior to birth in preparation for its postnatal function as an organ for gas exchange. Pulmonary surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse, is produced by type II pneumocytes within the lung. Reduced ability to produce surfactant leads to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Synthesis of the phospholipid component of surfactant, phosphatidylcholine (PC), is stimulated by fibroblast-pneumocyte factor (FPF), a protein expressed by fibroblast cells within the fetal lung. Although its function is well known, the identity of this important protein has remained a mystery. Recent research has suggested that FPF may be neuregulin-1, a growth factor found in many tissues during development.

Enhanced synthesis of PC (and therefore detection of FPF) is measured using a tissue culture-based method. Primary cultures of lung fibroblasts and type II pneumocytes are prepared, and fibroblast-conditioned medium (FCM) is exposed to the type II cells. Resultant PC synthesis is measured using radioisotope-labeled PC-precursor and a chloroform-based lipid extraction method. Initial results using this method were very inconsistent, so a study was undertaken to determine which parts of the method could be contributing to this inconsistency. Cell density of type II cultures (measured in &#956;g DNA.plate-1) was shown to have a significant effect on results. Treatment of fibroblasts with 100 nM dexamethasone and exposure of type II cultures to the resultant FCM caused a mean 9.17% increase in PC synthesis, but when only type II cultures with a cell density below 25 &#956;g DNA.plate-1 were analyzed, this value increased to 17.56%. Type II cultures with cell density above this threshold value showed a mean increase in synthesis of only 3.39%. The consistent application of [3H]-choline chloride also had a significant effect on results. Experiments utilizing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to stimulate fibroblasts were very inconsistent. The mean activity of the initial [3H]-choline chloride solution prepared for these experiments was found to be 2.04 &#956;Ci.mL-1, compared to a mean of 4.79 &#956;Ci.mL-1 for all other experiments. Observations from this section of the study led to considerable revision of the method used to measure PC synthesis.

Quadrupolar ion trap mass spectrometry (MS) was used to analyze FCM and determine if neuregulin-1 (NRG1) could be FPF. A mass spectrum was obtained for recombinant NRG1, with predominant ions of 1068, 1142 and 1246 m/z. All three of these ions were also detected in both control and dexamethasone-treated FCM. Partial fragmentation of 1068 m/z of NRG1 was achieved using MS2, and generated a base peak of 1047 m/z. This fragmentation was also observed in 1068 m/z from FCM. LC/MS was utilized to quantify NRG1 in FCM, using a standard curve generated using recombinant NRG1. Control FCM had a NRG1 concentration of 19.85 &#956;g.mL-1, while the concentration in dexamethasone treated FCM was 41.59 &#956;g.mL-1. FCM which had given no positive response to dexamethasone when tested using the indirect cultured cell system had a control NRG1 concentration of 20.85 &#956;g.mL-1, and a dexamethasone treated concentration of 22.84 &#956;g.mL-1. These values were not significantly different from the control value for FCM in those fibroblast cultures that had generated a positive response to dexamethasone. Results of this section of the study have provided strong evidence that NRG1 is a major component of FPF, and a review of the NRG1 signaling pathway further supports this conclusion.

Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are functionally related to neuregulins and are known to be important in fetal development. The effect of IGF-II on synthesis of surfactant PC and its subsequent secretion from type II pneumocytes was studied. In terms of PC synthesis, IGF-II was tested at concentrations of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 &#956;M. The mean increase in synthesis was found to be 6.00, 6.15 and 6.91%, respectively. These values were not significantly different from control values. Secretion of PC was tested over the concentration range of 0.1 to 1.6 &#956;M, with no significant effect observed. Possible inhibition by IGF-II was also studied, using the known stimulants of secretion, neuromedin C and isoproterenol. No significant effect on the enhanced level of secretion was observed when IGF-II was added with either secretagogue. Lack of an appropriate receptor and/or the possibility that cultured cells may not exactly mimic the situation in vivo are probably the reasons IGF-II has no effect on either synthesis or secretion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lung</field><field name="subject">maturation</field><field name="subject">fetal</field><field name="subject">fibroblast-pneumocyte factor</field><field name="subject">mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">pulmonary surfactant</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080430.141113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocean Views : An investigation into human-ocean relations</field><field name="creator">debkennedy@iprimus.com.au</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates some conceptions of oceans in modern Western societies that are highly influential in shaping human-ocean relations. My main aim in this dissertation is to demonstrate that the Western discourses of law, science and the aesthetic of the sublime illuminate characteristics of human-ocean relations in Western societies. I argue that the conceptions developed and perpetuated in the discourses of law, aesthetics and science unnecessarily constrain the possibilities for human-ocean relations and undermine just existences of oceans. A further aim of this dissertation is to set out an ethical political approach that is inclusive of a diversity of ocean views that facilitate improved knowledge about the oceans and transform dominant human ocean relations into more just relations.

In approaching my critique of Western discourses of law, aesthetics and science I canvas a range of philosophical, social and political theories, but make most use of the insights of feminist and ecological feminist thinkers into forms of oppression and environmental justice. I also move beyond critique to set out an approach for structuring ocean policy debates and outcomes with a form of political epistemology that de-centres influential Western conceptions of oceans and is inclusive of a diversity of perspectives.

In carrying out this dissertation&#146;s investigation I find that particular conceptions of oceans in the discourses of law, aesthetics and science narrowly define how Western human subjects think, feel and interact with oceans. These discourses provide a dominant position for Western subjects over those of other people and the oceans. This is how, in basic terms, I suggest that Western discourses undermine just existences for oceans. A common feature in the discourses that frame the conceptions of oceans that I discuss is the exclusion of a diversity of human-ocean relations from consideration. To counter the exclusionary practices of Western discourses I find that robust democratic processes are essential for just ocean existences. The importance of democratic processes is not only that they constitute ethical processes, and should be valued highly for that reason, but also because of a capacity to produce and deliver improved knowledge about the oceans and transform human-ocean relations. I advocate in particular the approach to political epistemology of Bruno Latour as one way to work toward just ocean existences. In the approach I advocate, oceans participate in democratic processes as agents, not as mere objects awaiting human benevolence or exploitation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080523.120432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multistage and multiple biomass approaches to efficient biological nitrogen removal using biofilm cultures</field><field name="creator">L.Hughes@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Nitrogen removal from wastewater is important for the revention of significant health and environmental impacts such as eutrophication. Nitrogen removal is achieved by the combined action of nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification is performed by autotrophic, slow growing microorganisms that require oxygen and are inhibited in the presence of denitrifiers when oxygen and COD are available due to competition for oxygen. Denitrification however, performed by relatively fast growing heterotrophic bacteria, is inhibited by oxygen and requires COD. This implies that nitrification and denitrification are mutually exclusive. The supply of oxygen to a fresh wastewater, high in ammonia and COD, causes waste of both oxygen and COD. Conservation of COD is therefore critical to efficient wastewater treatment. The approach investigated in this study to achieve complete nitrogen removal was to physically separate the nitrification and denitrification biomasses into separate bioreactors, supplying each with appropriate conditions for growth and activity.

A storage driven denitrification sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SDDR) was established which exhibited a high level of COD storage (up to 80% of influent COD) as poly-B-hydroxybutyrate capable of removing &gt;99% of nitrogen from wastewaters with a C/N ratio of 4.7 kg COD/kg N&#150;NO3 &#150;. The SDDR was combined in sequential operation with a nitrification reactor to achieve complete nitrogen removal. The multiple stage, multiple biomass reactor was operated in sequence, with Phase 1 - COD storage in the storage driven denitrification biofilm; Phase 2 - ammonia oxidation in the nitrification reactor; and Phase 3 - nitrate reduction using the stored COD in the storage driven denitrification reactor. The overall rate of nitrogen removal observed was up to 1.1 mmole NH3 L&#150;1 h&#150;1 and &gt;99% of nitrogen could be removed from wastewaters with a low C/N ratio of 3.9 kg COD/kg N&#150;NH3.

The multiple stage, multiple biomass system was limited in overall nitrogen removal the reduction in pH caused by nitrification. A parallel nitrification-denitrificatio (PND) reactor was developed in response to the pH control issue. The PND reactor was operated with Phase 1 &#150; COD storage in the storage driven denitrification biofilm and Phase 2 &#150; simultaneous circulation of reactor liquor between the denitrification and nitrification biofilms to achieve complete nitrogen removal and transfer of protons. The PND reactor performed competitively with the multistage reactor (removal of &gt;99% nitrogen from wastewaters with feed ratios of 3.4 kg COD/kg N&#150;NH3) without the need for addition of buffering material to oderate the pH.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomass</field><field name="subject">COD</field><field name="subject">Biofilm cultures</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080523.134154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progressive modification : how parents deal with home schooling their children with intellectual disabilities</field><field name="creator">Reilly, Lucy</field><field name="description">While home schooling is by no means a new phenomenon, the last three decades have seen an increasing trend in the engagement of this educational alternative. In many countries, including Australia, a growing number of families are opting to remove their children from the traditional schooling system for numerous reasons and educate them at home. In response to the recent home schooling movement a research base in this area of education has emerged. However, the majority of research has been undertaken primarily in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, with very few studies having examined home schooling in Australia. The existing corpus of research is also relatively small and incomplete. Also, certain categories of home schoolers and the processes involved in their undertaking of this modern version of a historically enduring educational alternative have been overlooked. In particular, children with disabilities appear to be one of the home schooling groups that have attracted very little research world wide. This group constituted the focus of the study reported in this thesis. Its particular concern was with generating theory regarding how parents deal with educating their children with intellectual disabilities from a home base over a period of one year. Data gathering was largely carried out through individual, face-to-face semi-structured interviewing and participant observation in the interpretivist qualitative research tradition. However, informal interviews, telephone interviews and documents were also used to gather supplementary data for the study. Data were coded and analysed using the open coding method of the grounded theory model and through the development and testing of propositions. The central research question which guided theory generation was as follows: 'How do parents within the Perth metropolitan area in the state of Western Australia deal with educating their children with intellectual disabilities from a home base over a period of one year?' The central proposition of the theory generated is that parents do so through progressive modification and that this involves them progressing through three stages over a period of one year. The first stage is designated the stage of drawing upon readily-available resources. The second stage is designated the stage of drawing upon support networks in a systematic fashion. The third stage is designated the stage of proceeding with confidence on the basis of having a set of principles for establishing a workable pattern of home schooling individualised for each circumstance. This theory provides a new perspective on how parents deal with the home schooling of their children with intellectual disabilities over a period of one year. A number of implications for further theory development, policy and practice are drawn from it. Several recommendations for further research are also made.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Home schooling -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Education -- Parent participation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Children with mental disabilities -- Education -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A convergent beam electron diffraction study of some rare-earth perovskite oxides</field><field name="creator">Jones, Daniel M.</field><field name="description">This work describes detailed convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) studies of GdAlO3 and LaAlO3 perovskites. CBED patterns tilted away from major zone axes have been found to have high sensitivity to the presence of mirror or glide mirror symmetry. Such patterns confirm to high accuracy that the space group of GdAlO3 is orthorhombic, Pnma. Tilted patterns from this well characterised structure also serve as benchmarks against which similar patterns may be compared. In the case of LaAlO3, tilted patterns enable the space group to be confirmed as rhombohedral R3c, previously claimed to be cubic (Fm3c) by CBED. Furthermore, no evidence for the low symmetry (I2/a or F1) phases proposed for LaAlO3 has been observed. The LaAlO3 study also gives a careful assessment of the influence of tilted specimen surfaces on the CBED data. Within the qualitative scope of these experiments, no symmetry degrading effects could be observed. Some preliminary Quantitative CBED (QCBED) data from LaAlO3 is also presented. This shows it will be possible to make a detailed study of the bonding charge density (&#916;&#961;) in this material when combined with X-ray diffraction data. Also included is a brief CBED study of LaFeO3, a material that is isostructural with GdAlO3. Although this is restricted to exact zone axis patterns, it is noted that tilted patterns have significant potential to improve the quality of the symmetry determination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Perovskite</field><field name="subject">Rare earth metals</field><field name="subject">Electrons -- Diffraction</field><field name="subject">Mirror symmetry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakawhiti whakaaro, whakakotahi i a tatou: convergence through consultation</field><field name="creator">Tipuna, Kitea</field><field name="description">None available</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interpretive research paradigm</field><field name="subject">Non-directive interview</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">Tangata whenua</field><field name="subject">maori world view</field><field name="subject">Government process and Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical exploratory analysis of genetic algorithms</field><field name="creator">Czarn, Andrew Simon Timothy</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been extensively used and studied in computer science, yet there is no generally accepted methodology for exploring which parameters significantly affect performance, whether there is any interaction between parameters and how performance varies with respect to changes in parameters. This thesis presents a rigorous yet practical statistical methodology for the exploratory study of GAs. This methodology addresses the issues of experimental design, blocking, power and response curve analysis. It details how statistical analysis may assist the investigator along the exploratory pathway. The statistical methodology is demonstrated in this thesis using a number of case studies with a classical genetic algorithm with one-point crossover and bit-replacement mutation. In doing so we answer a number of questions about the relationship between the performance of the GA and the operators and encoding used. The methodology is suitable, however, to be applied to other adaptive optimization algorithms not treated in this thesis. In the first instance, as an initial demonstration of our methodology, we describe case studies using four standard test functions. It is found that the effect upon performance of crossover is predominantly linear while the effect of mutation is predominantly quadratic. Higher order effects are noted but contribute less to overall behaviour. In the case of crossover both positive and negative gradients are found which suggests using rates as high as possible for some problems while possibly excluding it for others. .... This is illustrated by showing how the use of Gray codes impedes the performance on a lower modality test function compared with a higher modality test function. Computer animation is then used to illustrate the actual mechanism by which this occurs. Fourthly, the traditional concept of a GA is that of selection, crossover and mutation. However, a limited amount of data from the literature has suggested that the niche for the beneficial effect of crossover upon GA performance may be smaller than has traditionally been held. Based upon previous results on not-linear-separable problems an exploration is made by comparing two test problem suites, one comprising non-rotated functions and the other comprising the same functions rotated by 45 degrees in the solution space rendering them not-linear-separable. It is shown that for the difficult rotated functions the crossover operator is detrimental to the performance of the GA. It is conjectured that what makes a problem difficult for the GA is complex and involves factors such as the degree of optimization at local minima due to crossover, the bias associated with the mutation operator and the Hamming Distances present in the individual problems due to the encoding. Furthermore, the GA was tested on a real world landscape minimization problem to see if the results obtained would match those from the difficult rotated functions. It is demonstrated that they match and that the features which make certain of the test functions difficult are also present in the real world problem. Overall, the proposed methodology is found to be an effective tool for revealing relationships between a randomized optimization algorithm and its encoding and parameters that are difficult to establish from more ad-hoc experimental studies alone.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Computer algorithms</field><field name="subject">Statistical analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated conservation of the rare and endangered terrestrial orchid Caladenia huegelii H.G. Reichb</field><field name="creator">Swarts, Nigel</field><field name="description">The Orchidaceae is characterized by a remarkably diverse range of life forms and some of the most highly specialized interactions with soil fungi and insect pollinators found in the flowering plants. Many species are rare or threatened with extinction either directly through loss of habitat or over-collection or, indirectly through debilitation or loss of mycorrhizal association or pollinator capacity. Australian temperate terrestrial orchids represent one of the most threatened groups in the Australian flora with many taxa clinging to existence in urban and rural bushland remnants, road verges and unprotected bushland. The aim of this study is to research and develop integrated conservation based on critical aspects of terrestrial orchid biology and ecology, towards the recovery of the rare and endangered Western Australian terrestrial orchid Caladenia huegelii. This study identified key aspects involved in an integrated conservation approach and research focused on conservation genetics, mycorrhizal interactions and in situ and ex situ conservation strategies for this species. Using polymorphic microsatellite molecular markers, high levels of genetic diversity were found within remnant populations of C. huegelii, while weak differentiation was observed among populations over the species geographic range. These results indicate historic genetic exchange between C. huegelii populations, a possible consequence of the sexually deceptive pollination strategy and the capacity for widespread seed dispersal. Symbiotic germination studies revealed compatibility barriers to C. huegelii germination with the orchid possessing a highly specific orchid-mycorrhizal association relative to common sympatric congeners. These results were reflected in a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, revealing C. huegelii associates with only one endophyte species within the fungal family Sebacinaceae across its geographic range. Large scale in situ seed baiting demonstrated that endophytes compatible with C. huegelii were limited in distribution relative to common and widespread orchid species, a feature for C. huegelii that may be a major contributing factor in limiting the distributional range of the species. Detailed, within site seed baiting methods identified hotspots for mycorrhizal fungus compatible with C. huegelii that were unoccupied by the orchid. These mycorrhizal hotspots where used to investigate the effect of endophyte presence on survival of transplanted mature plants and seedling outplants. The in situ survival of glasshouse propagated seedlings was further optimized by incubating seedlings in growth containers before transfer to soil and outplanting seedlings in their second growing season. The findings of this study will substantially advance the recovery of C. huegelii and provide benchmark knowledge for similar projects with other rare and threatened terrestrial orchid species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endangered plants -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rare plants -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Orchids -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant conservation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Orchid conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frank Bridge and the English pastoral tradition</field><field name="creator">Hopwood, Paul Andrew</field><field name="description">This study's thesis is that instances of pastoralism in the works of Frank Bridge from 1914 to 1930 demonstrate a gradual darkening of his pastoral vision, and evince his increasingly complex relationship with the genre of pastoral music that flourished in English music in the early twentieth century (referred to in this study as 'the English pastoral tradition'). The study traces the change from the sensual and romantic idyll of Summer (1914-15), through progressively more ambiguous and darker manifestations of pastoral, and eventually to a bleak anti-pastoral vision in Oration (1930). This trend reflects Bridge's increasingly ambivalent relationship with the English musical establishment, his own radical change of musical language during these years, and significant changes in his personal circumstances. It also reflects the decline of romanticism and the rise of modernism in English music, a paradigm-shift that happened around the time of World War I, considerably later than in the music, literature and visual art of continental Europe. Chapters 1 to 3 examine the English pastoral tradition from three different contexts. Chapter 1 suggests that the English pastoral tradition may be understood as a genre, and describes a number of 'family resemblances' that run through and characterise it. Second, the English pastoral tradition is placed in the context of pastoral art from Classical times to the twentieth century, with a focus on pastoral in English literature. Finally, chapter 3 examines the social and cultural context of the English pastoral tradition and explores resonances between English society in the early twentieth century and the meaningstructures that underpin pastoral. The remaining chapters comprise a series of analytical discussions of six of Frank Bridge's works: Summer (1914-5), the first of the Two Poems (1915), Enter Spring (1926-7), There is a willow grows aslant a brook (1927), Rhapsody-Trio (1928) and Oration (1930). While a variety of analytical techniques are employed, the approach is broadly semiotic and focussed on musical meaning. Each analysis traces the relationships between signifying structures in the works and various musical and non-musical strands of the contextualising cultural discourse. As a result the works become the starting points for relatively wide-ranging discussions in which pastoralism in the music of Frank Bridge is understood as a site at which ideas of English nationalism and international modernism engaged with one another. Frank Bridge's place in this discourse, as revealed in the analyses of his works, becomes increasingly ambivalent and modernist.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music -- England -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Bridge, Frank, -- 1879-1941</field><field name="subject">Music -- Semiotics</field><field name="subject">Music -- Philosophy and aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Frank Bridge</field><field name="subject">English pastoral music</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of wave impact on offshore structures</field><field name="creator">Abdolmaleki, Kourosh</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The hydrodynamics of wave impact on offshore structures is not well understood. Wave impacts often involve large deformations of water free-surface. Therefore, a wave impact problem is usually combined with a free-surface problem. The complexity is expanded when the body exposed to a wave impact is allowed to move. The nonlinear interactions between a moving body and fluid is a complicated process that has been a dilemma in the engineering design of offshore and coastal structures for a long time. This thesis used experimental and numerical means to develop further understanding of the wave impact problems as well as to create a numerical tool suitable for simulation of such problems. The study included the consideration of moving boundaries in order to include the coupled interactions of the body and fluid. The thesis is organized into two experimental and numerical parts. There is a lack of benchmarking experimental data for studying fluid-structure interactions with moving boundaries. In the experimental part of this research, novel experiments were, therefore, designed and performed that were useful for validation of the numerical developments. By considering a dynamical system with only one degree of freedom, the complexity of the experiments performed was minimal. The setup included a plate that was attached to the bottom of a flume via a hinge and tethered by two springs from the top  one at each side. The experiments modelled fluid-structure interactions in three subsets. The first subset studied a highly nonlinear decay test, which resembled a harsh wave impact (or slam) incident. The second subset included waves overtopping on the vertically restrained plate. In the third subset, the plate was free to oscillate and was excited by the same waves. The wave overtopping the plate resembled the physics of the green water on fixed and moving structures. An analytical solution based on linear potential theory was provided for comparison with experimental results. ... In simulation of the nonlinear decay test, the SPH results captured the frequency variation in plate oscillations, which indicated that the radiation forces (added mass and damping forces) were calculated satisfactorily. In simulation of the nonlinear waves, the waves progressed in the flume similar to the physical experiments and the total energy of the system was conserved with an error of 0.025% of the total initial energy. The wave-plate interactions were successfully modelled by SPH. The simulations included wave run-up and shipping of water for fixed and oscillating plate cases. The effects of the plate oscillations on the flow regime are also discussed in detail. The combination of experimental and numerical investigation provided further understanding of wave impact problems. The novel design of the experiments extended the study to moving boundaries in small scale. The use of SPH eliminated the difficulties of dealing with free-surface problems so that the focus of study could be placed on the impact forces on fixed and moving bodies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Particle methods (Numerical analysis)</field><field name="subject">Fluid-structure interaction -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures -- Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Ocean waves --  -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Smoothed particle hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures, CFD</field><field name="subject">Green water</field><field name="subject">Wave impact</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear impact loads</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy use in the New Zealand tourism sector</field><field name="creator">Becken, Susanne</field><field name="description">Energy use associated with tourism has rarely been studied, despite a potentially considerable contribution to global or national energy demand and concomitant greenhouse gas emissions. In New Zealand, tourism constitutes an increasingly important economic sector that is supported by the Government to induce further economic growth. At the same time New Zealand is facing the challenge of reducing currently increasing fossil fuel combustion and carbon dioxide emissions. As a response, this study investigated the contribution tourism makes to energy use in New Zealand. In particular it has examined the role of the three main tourism subsectors (transport, accommodation, and attractions/activities), and different domestic and international 'tourist types'. Seven separate data analyses provided inputs for building a model based on 'tourist types' from which energy use in the New Zealand tourism sector could be estimated. Tourism was found to contribute at least 5.6% to national energy demand, which is larger than its 4.9% contribution to GDP in 2000. Transport, in particular domestic air and car travel, was identified as the dominant energy consumer. Within the accommodation sub-sector, hotels are the largest energy consumers, both in total and on a per visitor-night basis. Of the three sub-sectors, attractions and activities contribute least to energy use, however, activities such as scenic flights or boat cruises were recognised as being energy intensive. As a result of larger visitor volumes, domestic tourists contribute more to energy consumption than international tourists. Domestic and international tourists types differ in their energy consumption patterns, for example measured as energy use per travel day. Tourist types that rely on air travel are the most energy intensive ones, for example the domestic 'long air business' travellers or the international 'coach tourists'. The importance of international tourists' energy use will increase, given current growth rates. There are many options to decrease energy use of the tourism sector, with the most effective ones being within the energy intensive transport sub-sector. Increasing vehicle efficiencies and decreasing travel distances appear to be the most promising measures. This study argues that energy use depends largely on tourists' travel behaviour. Changing behaviour is possible but is postulated to be very difficult, and further research is needed to better understand tourists' motivations, expectations and decision-making. Only then, can strategies be developed and implemented to alter travel behaviours to better balance energy use, other environmental impacts and economic yield. Such a balance is a crucial consideration in the search for more sustainable forms of tourism.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable tourism</field><field name="subject">energy use</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">tourist types</field><field name="subject">tourist behaviour</field><field name="subject">transport</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300804 Environmental impact assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modifying function and fibrosis of cardiac and skeletal muscle from mdx mice</field><field name="creator">van Erp, Christel</field><field name="description">Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal condition occurring in approximately 1 in 3500 male births and is due to the lack of a protein called dystrophin. Initially DMD was considered a skeletal myopathy, but the pathology and consequences of cardiomyopathy are being increasingly recognised. Fibrosis, resulting from continual cycles of degeneration of the muscle tissues followed by inadequate regeneration of the muscles, is progressive in both cardiac and skeletal dystrophic muscle. In the heart fibrosis interferes with contractility and rhythm whereas it affects contractile function and causes contractures in skeletal muscles. This study utilised the mdx mouse which exhibits a pathological loss of muscle fibres and fibrosis characteristic of DMD, to examine a range of mechanisms that can influence muscle function and fibrosis. Ageing and workload both appear to contribute to the development of dystrophic features in cardiac and skeletal muscle of the mdx mouse. Therefore the effect of eccentric exercise on cardiac and skeletal muscle was examined in older mdx mice. Mice ran in 30 minute sessions for five months, 5 days per week. Downhill treadmill running did not exacerbate the contractile function or fibrosis of the mdx heart or the EDL, SOL or diaphragm muscles suggesting that cytokines influence function and fibrosis to a greater extent than workload alone. The role of the cytokine TGF-beta was examined by treating mdx mice with the TGF-beta antagonist pirfenidone at 0.4, 0.8 or 1.2 per cent in drinking water for six months. Pirfenidone improved cardiac contractility (P&lt;0.01) and coronary flow (P&lt;0.05), to levels comparable to control mice, despite no reduction in cardiac fibrosis. Pirfenidone did not reduce fibrosis or improve function in skeletal muscle. A deficiency of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in DMD and mdx mice causes a lowered production of nitric oxide indicating that the substrate of nNOS, l-arginine, may be beneficial to cardiac and skeletal muscle function in mdx mice. Oral l-arginine (5 mg/g bw) improved cardiac contractility, coronary flow and reduced cardiac fibrosis (P&lt;0.05) without improving skeletal muscle function or fibrosis. In contrast, 10 mg/g bw l-arginine improved cardiac function and coronary flow (P&lt;0.01), despite also elevating cardiac collagen. This increment in collagen was prevented by co-administration of prednisone. The experiments described in this dissertation reveal for the first time that pharmacological treatments in mdx mice can improve cardiac structure and function. Further elucidation of the optimum time and doses of such treatments may result in future pharmacological treatments to improve cardiac function and fibrosis in DMD.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fibrosis</field><field name="subject">cardiac</field><field name="subject">skeletal muscle</field><field name="subject">Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</field><field name="subject">neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)</field><field name="subject">dystrophin</field><field name="subject">utrophin</field><field name="subject">muscular dystrophic x-linked (mdx)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001521/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fluorescent labelling technique to detect changes in the thiol redox state of proteins following mild oxidative stress</field><field name="creator">Lui, James Kwok Ching</field><field name="description">There is increasing evidence that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can act as a signalling molecule capable of modulating a variety of biochemical and genetic systems. Using Jurkat T-lymphocytes, this study initially investigated the involvement of H2O2 in the activation of a specific signalling protein  extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). It was found that as a result of H2O2 treatment, mitochondrial complex activities decreased which led to subsequent increase of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The increase of ROS resulted in higher cellular H2O2 as well as increased ERK activation. This study demonstrated that in an oxidative stress setting, H2O2 production from the mitochondria was an essential component in maintaining the activation of a signalling protein. One way in which H2O2 could influence protein function is by the oxidation of susceptible thiol groups of cysteine residues. To further understand the variety of signalling pathways that H2O2 may be involved in, an improved proteomics technique was developed to globally identify proteins with susceptible thiol groups.

Joint trauma can damage the articular surface causing pain, loss of mobility and deformation. Currently there is no uniform treatment protocol for managing focal cartilage defects, with most treatment options targeted towards symptomatic relief but not limiting the progression into osteoarthritis (OA). Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and more recently matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI), have emerged as promising methods for producing hyaline or hyaline-like repair tissue, however there remains some controversy regarding the exact histological nature of the tissue formed. Histological characterisation of AC repairs requires destructive tissue biopsy potentially inducing further joint pathology thereby negating the treatment effect. OA is recognised as a major cause of pain, loss of function and disability in Western populations, however the exact aetiology is yet to be elucidated. The assessment of both OA and cartilage repair has been limited to macroscopic observation, radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or destructive biopsy. The development of non-destructive AC assessment modalities will facilitate further development of AC repair techniques and enable early monitoring of OA changes in both experimental animal models and clinical subjects. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a type of fluorescence microscopy that generates high-resolution three-dimensional images from relatively thick sections of tissue. ... Biomechanical analysis suggested that the mechanical properties of MACI tissue remain inferior for at least three months. This study showed the potential of a multi-site sheep model of articular cartilage defect repair and validated its assessment via LSCA. Finally, the LSCA was used to arthroscopically image the cartilage of an intact fresh frozen cadaveric knee from a patient with clinically diagnosed OA. Images were correlated to ICRS (Outerbridge) Grades I-IV and histology. The LSCA gave excellent visualization of cell morphology and cell density to a depth of up to 200'm. Classical OA changes including clustering chondrocytes, surface fibrillation and fissure formation were imaged. Fair to moderate agreement was demonstrated with statistically significant correlations between all modalities. This study confirmed the viability of the LSCA for non-destructive imaging of the microstructure of the OA cartilage. In conclusion, the LSCA identified histological features of orthopaedic tissues, accurately quantified chondrocyte morphology and demonstrated classical OA changes. While the development and investigation of an ovine model of cartilage repair showed the treatment benefit of MACI, some biomechanical issues remain. Ultimately, the LSCA has been demonstrated as a reliable nondestructive imaging modality capable of providing optical histology without the need for mechanical biopsy.

(Chenopodiaceae) in southwest Australian cropping systems</field><field name="creator">Borger, Catherine</field><field name="description">Salsola australis is an introduced weed of crop and pasture systems in the Western Australian broad acre cropping and pasture region (wheat-belt). This thesis investigated the classification, biology and ecology of the genus Salsola in southwest Australia, as well as modelling the effectiveness of possible weed control practices. Prior to this research, S. tragus was the only recognised species of the Salsola genus within Australia. However, genetic analysis revealed that four genetically distinct putative taxa of the genus Salsola were found in southwest Australia, none of which were S. tragus. The taxa that is the most prevalent agricultural weed was classified as S. australis, but the other three putative taxa could not be matched to recognised species. All four taxa were diploid (2n = 18), as opposed to tetraploid (2n = 36) S. tragus. Within the agricultural system of southwest Australia, S. australis plants established throughout the year, although the majority of seed production occurred in late summer and autumn. Total seed production (138-7734 seeds per plant) and seed viability (7.6-62.8%) of S. australis were lower than that reported for other agricultural weed species of the Salsola genus. Seed dispersal occurred when the senesced plants broke free of their root system to become mobile. Wind driven plants travelled and shed seed over distances of 1.6 to 1247.2 m. Movement of approximately half the plants was restricted to less than 100 m by entanglement with other S. australis plants within the stand. Some seed was retained on the senesced plants, but the germinability of this seed fell to less than 2% in the two month period following plant senescence (i.e. a decline of 79%). Once seed shed into the soil seed bank, anywhere from 32.3 to 80.7% of the viable seeds germinated in the year following seed production, with the rest remaining dormant or degrading. A model of the life cycle of S. australis based on the population ecology data indicated that the dormant seed bank had very little effect on annual seedling recruitment, but seed dispersal from neighbouring populations had a large impact on population growth rate. Therefore, the most successful weed control measures were those that restricted seed dispersal from neighbouring populations, or those that were applied to all populations in the region rather than to a single population. Weed control techniques applied to a single population, without reducing seed dispersal, could not reduce population size.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salsola australis -- Control -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Cropping systems -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Salsola australis -- Ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Salsola australis</field><field name="subject">Biology</field><field name="subject">Weed</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A din of whispers : community, state control, and violence in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Herriman, Nicholas</field><field name="description">&lt;abstract&gt;Most literature on state-society relations in Indonesia assumes an overbearing and oppressive state. In this thesis, I argue that local communities can exert far more influence over state officials, and can be far more resistant to state control, than has previously been acknowledged. I critically analyse the idea of a state with extensive control by focusing on killings alleged sorcerers in a rural area in which I undertook fieldwork. Killings of 'sorcerers' occur when neighbours, family members, and friends believe that one among them is a sorcerer. They group together and, assisted by other local residents, kill the 'sorcerer'. Such killings have been occurring intermittently for at least the past half-century. These usually sporadic killings turned into an outbreak in 1998. The outbreak was precipitated by three factors, in particular: 1. An attempt by the district government to stop killings, which was seen to confirm the identity of sorcerers; 2. Local residents' understanding of the Indonesian reform movement (Reformasi) to incorporate violent attacks on 'sorcerers'; and, 3. The perceived slowness of the police and army response which was understood as tacitly permitting the killings. Local residents interpreted these factors as providing an 'opportunity' to attack 'sorcerers', accounting for around 100 deaths. Although the outbreak was triggered by national- and district-level events, the killings remained local; neighbours, family, and acquaintances of the victims undertook the killings. At this time, the New Order regime of President Soeharto?which scholars have tended to characterise as a state which exerted far-reaching control over society?had just collapsed. Nevertheless, violent actions against 'sorcerers' had occurred during the New Order period, even though they stood in contrast to the order and rule of law and the controlled use of violence that this regime promoted. In order to explain the persistence of anti-'sorcerer' actions, my original findings identify a significant weakness in central state control. Local state officials cannot, and, in many cases, do not want to, stop killings. These officials are connected by ties of locality and kinship to the overwhelming majority of local people, and believe that the 'sorcerer' is guilty. Instead of following demands of law and order from superiors, they are influenced by local communities. Local communities thus exert control over local state representatives, accounting for a breakdown of state control at the local level. This finding of strong community ties and limited state control calls for a reexamination of violence in Indonesia. Violence is usually portrayed as being perpetrated by an aggressive, culpable state on an innocent and passive society. In Banyuwangi, violence emanated from within communities and local state representatives were either unwilling or unable to control it. Eventually, a crackdown by non-local police and army forces brought the outbreak of killings to a halt. However, after these forces left, actions against 'sorcerers' resumed. By demonstrating that ties of locality and kinship undermine state attempts to control local community, I contribute to a revision of the image of an overbearing and violently repressive state in Indonesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia -- Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Violence -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Witchcraft -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Social control -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">State</field><field name="subject">Withcraft and Sorcery</field><field name="subject">Violence</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of the practicum to teacher development</field><field name="creator">Veale, Ann.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 94-102.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Student teaching South Australia</field><field name="subject">Teachers Training of South Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09EDM/09edmv394.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:5813048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into mechanisms of paracetamol-induced toxicity using &#236;n vitro' systems</field><field name="creator">Bruschi, Sam A.

The study also pays particular attention to relationships between the Society and the state, showing how the Society was gradually drawn into dependence on the state. The thesis begins with an overview of the Society's work prior to its decision to move from London to Redhill in 1849. Next it proceeds to a close study of the Society's work until the end of the century. The decision to concentrate on the Redhill Farm School reflects not only changing views about the reformation of young offenders, but also the financial imperatives which forced the Society along paths shaped by the state. Close attention is paid to the way Parliamentary inquiries and commissions, which in the mid-Victorian period tended to laud the Society as a model, later criticized it for lagging behind advanced thinking. Interwoven within this narratives are descriptions of the specific measures the Society took for training and caring for boys at Redhill. It explores the nature of unpaid labour, training and discipline enforced at the farm school. It also examines the variety of subjects taught during the years a boy would spend working within a strict discipline, and the methods used to enforce such discipline. Another subject worthy of extended consideration is the Society's enthusiasm for emigration to British colonies following a boy's term of incarceration. The thesis closes with an examination of how and why the Society lost its reputation as a leader in the treatment of young offenders in the late-Victorian period, as government imposed new rules and regulations. The overall argument is that the Society  born as the result of moral panics about children at risk  became a long-term survivor as the result of partnerships with the state.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philanthropic Society (London, England) -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Charities -- Great Britain -- History</field><field name="subject">Juvenile delinquency</field><field name="subject">Reformatories</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- Social conditions -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Philanthropic</field><field name="subject">Reformatory schools</field><field name="subject">Farm schools</field><field name="subject">Juvenile offenders</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microstructural information beyond the resolution limit : studies in two coherent, wide-field biomedical imaging systems</field><field name="creator">Hillman, Timothy R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Imaging systems in medicine</field><field name="subject">Optical coherence tomography</field><field name="subject">Holography in medicine</field><field name="subject">Optical tomography</field><field name="subject">Coherence (Optics)</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic imaging</field><field name="subject">Optical coherence tomography</field><field name="subject">Speckle</field><field name="subject">Digital holography</field><field name="subject">Light angular scattering spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Synthetic aperture microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal dynamics of the coastal water column</field><field name="creator">Verspecht, Florence</field><field name="description">Field measurements and numerical modelling of the shallow coastal waters offshore in south-western Australia were used to describe changes in the water column's vertical structure and the biological response on temporal scales of the order of hours and days. A cycle of chlorophyll a concentration, primary production, and photosystem II function on a diel timescale, which was related to changes in the solar irradiance and thermal structure, was identified. The diel cycle included (1) vertically well-mixed (or weakly linear) conditions in density and chlorophyll a early in the morning, resulting from vertical mixing through penetrative overnight convection; (2) depleted chlorophyll a concentration in the surface layer during the middle of the day due to photoinhibition; (3) an increased chlorophyll a concentration in the bottom layer by late afternoon due to optimum light conditions; and (4) the formation of a chlorophyll a break point (CBP) at the thermocline, which migrated downwards with the deepening surface mixed layer. On a longer timescale (days), moored acoustic instruments were used to derive echo level (EL), which approximated suspended particulate matter (SPM). Wind events ultimately controlled SPM, a conclusion based on (1) elevated EL during high windgenerated turbulence and bed shear stress, (2) positive time-lagged correlations between wind speed and EL at three field sites with different exposures to wave action, and (3) significant negative correlations between wind speed and depth-differentiated echo level (d(EL)/dz) at all sites. Sea breezes produced a similar response in EL through the water column to a small storm event, and wind-driven SPM resuspension resulted in a reduction in the sub-surface light climate (kd). Near-bed dissolved oxygen concentrations varied in accord with elevated wind speeds, EL and kd, highlighting a possible suppression of photosynthesis. One-dimensional modelling revealed that wind stirring was most often the dominant process in these waters. It was found that for a brief period during thermal stratification there was shear production of turbulent instabilities that migrated from the thermocline to the surface and the seabed. Convective cooling was not able to mix the water column entirely overnight without the addition of wind, and minimum wind speeds were determined for this complete vertical mixing. Bottom-generated turbulence was limited to a small region above the bed, and was deemed insignificant compared with mixing generated at the surface. Minimum wind speeds required for de-stratification and prevention of stratification were determined for summer, autumn and winter. A hypothetical desalination outfall was simulated for all seasons and it was concluded that positioning of the discharge at middepth was preferable compared to at the seabed.

Nevertheless, tropical deforestation in many parts of the world continues at an alarming rate. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), tropical rainforest is relatively well maintained, with about 70 % of the land area still covered by primary forest. However, PNG's native forests are coming under increasing pressure, particularly from selective logging for high quality timber. While the forests of PNG, and more broadly the entire New Guinea Island, are recognised as of high conservation and ecological significance, they remain grossly understudied with little knowledge of key ecosystem processes within lowland forests in particular. Such knowledge is urgently required if the impacts of logging and other land-use change are to be assessed and in order to develop sustainable management systems. This thesis investigated the impacts of logging on diversity and nutrient cycling in a lowland tropical rainforest growing on limestone soils in the area of the Mongi-Busiga Forest Management Agreement (FMA, which is a logging concession area), in northeastern PNG. These forests are on relatively young soils and provide a useful contrast to the majority of tropical forests. The research includes a four-year study of the recovery of diversity and structure after logging, and quantified forest structure, tree species diversity, forest biomass and productivity, and nutrient distribution and cycling. This thesis also examines the ecological sustainability of Eucalyptus deglupta plantations in Wasab, PNG as an alternative resource for timber and biomass energy. The thesis concludes with a discussion of long-term forest recovery and sustainable forest management in north-eastern PNG. Two adjacent one-hectare plots were established in lowland tropical rainforest at Mongi-Busiga FMA. One of these plots was subsequently selectively logged, one year after establishment. Before logging, the two one-hectare plots contained a total of 37 families, 70 genera and 110 tree species that were &gt;5 cm in diameter at breast height. Mean basal area was 42.4 m2 ha-1. Two tree species, Madhuca leucodermis (Sapotaceae) and Pometia pinnata (Sapindaceae) accounted for ~60% of the total basal area. Gymnacranthera paniculata (Myristicaceae) was the most common species and accounted for 13% of individuals. ... This study concludes that the Mongi-Busiga forest has many unusual characteristics for a tropical forest, including relatively low diversity of tree species, high accumulation of P in the biomass, and N limitations, compared to other tropical rainforests. However, those extraordinary characteristics may be explained well by the underlying geology of young, marine-derived limestone. Sustainable management of the lowland tropical forests of PNG should consider the consequences of logging on nutrient cycling processes, with the possible significant removal of P from site with repeated logging, as well as the interactions between N and P in these systems. Establishment of Eucalyptus plantations on previously cleared land also has the potential to meet some of the timber and biomass energy requirements of northern PNG in ecologically sustainable manner.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rain forests -- Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Forest biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Nutrient cycles</field><field name="subject">Plantations -- Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Forest management -- Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Logging -- Environmental aspects -- Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Tropical rainforest</field><field name="subject">Nutrient cycling</field><field name="subject">Impacts of logging</field><field name="subject">Species diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corruption and its impact on economic growth : is East Asia special?</field><field name="creator">Ali, Nasrul</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis raised serious questions about the nature of East Asia's rise to economic prosperity, once labelled as a 'miracle' by the World Bank. In particular, East Asian governments were criticised for allowing rampant corruption to pervade their economies. At a conceptual level, the overwhelming majority of studies argue that corruption, defined as the misuse of public office for private gain, has impeded growth. Empirically, many studies have shown the detrimental impact of corruption on economic growth but few have analysed the particular effect of corruption on East Asia's economic growth in the years leading up to the 1997 Crisis, a period characterised by superior economic growth rates against the backdrop of corruption. This study seeks to fill that gap. By virtue of its clandestine nature, any study on corruption is subject to measurement limitations and this study is no exception. The only available data on corruption are indices published by a handful of various international organisations. Each of these indices follows a similar format: they are based partly or wholly on surveys of the corporate sector in each of the sample countries, the results of which are converted into corruption scores and used to rank the sample countries. Although there is a general consistency in rankings across the different indices, the survey questions tend to equate corruption with bribery. In one survey which questioned respondents about corruption and bribery in separate questions, the results indicated that the two are not necessarily synonymous at least in the minds of respondents. A brief analysis of the nature of corruption within East Asia reveals why the tendency to equate corruption with bribery can be misleading, and therefore raises doubts about the credibility of the aforementioned corruption indices. Many countries in East Asia are shown to harbour a network of patron-client relationships within a centralised framework. ... When using the available corruption indices as measures of corruption in a corruption-growth model that is applied to cross-sectional data covering 141 countries in 1996, corruption is found to have a significant positive relationship with economic growth for two of the corruption indices. However, no particular significant relationship is found to exist for East Asian countries within the sample. The corruption indices are then combined to produce a single index of corruption which is then used in a corruption-growth model and applied to panel data covering 33 countries over a twenty year period from 1984 to 2003. This time the corruption variable is found to have a significant positive relationship with economic growth for East Asian countries (excluding Singapore) during 1986-1996. Finally, the concept of rent-seeking is examined as an alternative to the typical principal-agent model of corruption used in the literature, based on its strong resonance with the particular nature of corruption in East Asia. A measure of rent-seeking is developed, and using cross-sectional data for 57 countries in 1996 reveals that rent-seeking has a significant positive relationship with economic growth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corruption -- Economic aspects -- East Asia</field><field name="subject">Political corruption -- Economic aspects -- East Asia</field><field name="subject">Corruption -- Economic models</field><field name="subject">Rent (Economic theory)</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The phosphite responsive transcriptome of phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="creator">M.King@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Phosphite has been used to effectively control the soil borne plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi in many horticultural crops, forest trees and natural ecosystems. However, the molecular mechanisms behind phosphite action on this pathogen are poorly understood.

Several studies have shown that phosphite inhibits growth and zoospore production of P. cinnamomi and in addition induces significant physiological and metabolic changes in the mycelium. As an approach to understanding the mechanisms and relevance of these changes in the pathogen, the effect of phosphite on gene expression was investigated using microarray analysis. To construct the microarray, RNA was extracted from phosphite-treated (40 ug/ml) mycelium of P. cinnamomi isolate MP 80. The chosen phosphite concentration inhibited the mycelial growth by 70% but provided sufficient mycelium for RNA extractions after 4 days growth at 25C.

The mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and cloned into lambda to construct a library consisting of 2 million pfu of which 80 % were recombinant phage. The inserts were sequenced for a random selection of clones from the library. The nucleotide sequences generated revealed a range of different P. cinnamomi genes being expressed and demonstrated that the cDNA library provided a good representation of the transcripts expressed in P. cinnamomi. The types of genes found to be expressed in the mycelium of P. cinnamomi included genes encoding GTP binding proteins involved in vesicle transport, structural proteins involved in maintaining cell membrane integrity,elicitors, phosphatases and ribosomal proteins.

Over nine thousand cDNA transcripts were randomly selected from the cDNA library and prepared by PCR amplification and purification for microarray construction. Custom made cDNA arrays containing 9216 cDNA transcripts were constructed and probed with RNA from untreated mycelium and mycelium grown in medium with 40 ug/ml phosphite.

Two genes, EF-1 alpha and cinnamomin gene, identified by qRT-PCR as being constitutively expressed were also positioned on the arrays as positive controls. In the process of identifying constitutively expressed genes, qRT PCR revealed that phosphite down-regulated a gene encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, a component of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway involved in the removal of abnormal and short lived-regulatory proteins and rate limiting enzymes.

From the arrays a further seventy-two transcripts with altered patterns in gene expression (fold change &gt; 2) were identified. The majority of the cDNA transcripts spotted on the array were down-regulated with changes in gene expression ranging from 2- to 3.5-fold. Thirty-two cDNA transcripts were up-regulated with changes in gene expression ranging from 2- to 16-fold. Characterisation by sequencing revealed that the most highly induced transcripts coded for ADP-ribosylation factors, an ABC cassette transporter and a glycosyl transferase. A transcript encoding a vitamin B6 biosynthesis protein was also identified as up-regulated by 2.9-fold. In contrast, the down-regulated transcripts coded for cellulose synthase I, annexin, glutamine synthetase, metallothionein and an alternative oxidase. The results are discussed in terms of possible roles and mechanism(s) of phosphite action within the mycelium of P.cinnamomi.

This work is the first comprehensive screen for phosphite regulated-gene expression in P. cinnamomi and represents a significant step towards an understanding of the mode of action of phosphite on this organism. This thesis provides valuable information on the molecular interaction between phosphite and P. cinnamomi, which in future studies may stimulate the discovery of novel methods and cellular targets for the control of plant pathogenic Oomycetes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">phosphite</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">microarrays</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080526.104656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From chromaffin cells to Phaeochromocytoma : insight into the sympathoadrenal cell lineage</field><field name="creator">Clearys@ninds.nih.gov</field><field name="description">Chromaffin cells are a modified post-ganglionic sympathetic neuron, which synthesise and secrete catecholamines. The neoplastic transformation of chromaffin cells is demonstrated by the tumour phaeochromocytoma, a functional tumour that recapitulates the normal role of chromaffin cells by synthesising, storing and releasing excess catecholamines. Within this thesis we have explored several aspects of chromaffin cell and phaeochromocytoma tumour biology, including the specific expression of key sympathoadrenal markers such as the noradrenaline transporter (NAT), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and chromogranin A (CGA) in normal human and mouse chromaffin cells versus phaeochromocytomas of human and mouse origin.

Catecholamine-mediated signalling in chromaffin cells is terminated by the sequestration of extracellular catecholamines back into the cell via the noradrenaline transporter (NAT). Following observations that within the rat adrenal medulla, NAT is expressed in PNMT-positive chromaffin cells we explored whether this pattern of expression is also present in the human adrenal medulla. While we successfully established that NAT and PNMT are co localised, we also found that all human adrenal chromaffin cells are PNMT-positive. In the rat, NAT is also observed within the cytoplasm and has been suggested to be associated with secretory vesicles, thus using the secretory vesicle marker, CGA, we demonstrate that NAT is associated with secretory vesicles. However, in contrast to our findings within the normal chromaffin cells, in situ NAT expression in human phaeochromocytoma tumour samples was distorted, with observed changes including the level and type of staining observed, and disruptions to the strict NAT-CGA association observed in the normal adrenal.

Continuing our theme of NAT, we investigated if pre treating the phaeochromocytoma PC12 cell line with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin had an effect on the expression of NAT, to give an indication of the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of metastatic phaeochromocytoma with radiolabelled 131Iodometabenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG), a noradrenaline analogue which can be incorporated into phaeochromocytoma tumour cells though uptake through NAT. The premise of this study is derived from previous work in which neuroblastoma cells pre-treated with cisplatin were more responsive to (131I-MIBG) accumulation due to increased activity and expression of the transporter. Thus we treated PC12 cells for 24-hours in a range of cisplatin concentrations and measured the effect on NAT expression. However, unlike the findings in neuroblastoma cells, in our study, we did not observe an effect of cisplatin pretreatment on NAT activity or expression in PC12 cells.

Upto 30% of phaeochromocytoma arise as apart of a hereditary syndrome. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, due to germline mutations to the VHL gene, and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), due to germline mutations to the RET gene represent two examples of hereditable endocrine disorders where phaeochromocytoma is a presenting feature. Notable differences in clinical presentation and tumour biology have been identified in phaeochromocytomas from patients with VHL and MEN 2. These differences prompted us to explore whether these observations extend to the chromaffin granule constituents, NPY and CGA.

Patients with MEN 2 disease have a greater incidence of hypertension than patients with VHL disease, MEN 2 are characterised by an adrenergic phenotype (produce predominantly-adrenaline), whereas VHL phaeochromocytomas are noradrenergic (produce predominantly-noradrenaline). Neuropeptide Y, which has powerful vasoactive properties capable of significantly elevating blood pressure, is stored and released with catecholamines and is thought to be associated with PNMT-positive chromaffin cells. Thus, we questioned whether the differences in the symptomatology between VHL and MEN 2 patients may be related to differences in NPY expression between the two groups, and whether any differences in NPY relate to adrenaline and/or PNMT content, or are linked to hereditary factors. Thus we compared tumour samples from four cohorts of patients: (i) adrenergic versus noradrenergic phenotype, (ii) hereditary versus no hereditary syndrome. Results demonstrated that although tumour NPY levels (mRNA and peptide) correlate with PNMT expression and/or adrenaline content, when NPY expression was compared between groups of patients (adrenergic vs noradrenergic; hereditary versus nonhereditary) difference in NPY levels were only significant between VHL and MEN 2 tumour and not between sporadic adrenergic and noradrenergic Immunohistochemistry also supported the above observations. Hence, we concluded that NPY expression in all groups of phaeochromocytoma examined in this study, this effect is not related to tumour biochemical phenotype but rather appears to be a specific unique trait of VHL phaeochromocytomas.

Continuing our theme of the possible differential expression of chromaffin granule constituents between VHL and MEN 2 patients, we also investigated CGA levels in plasma and tumour samples. Given, VHL tumours possess less chromaffin granules than MEN 2 tumours, and CGA has been implicated as a key director of secretory vesicle biogenesis we investigated whether CGA was differentially expressed between VHL and MEN 2 tumours. We found CGA expression was significantly greater in MEN 2 tumours (mRNA; 3-fold, and protein; 20-fold), with western blot confirming this trend. We also found that plasma CGA was greater in MEN 2 patients but not significantly, consequently, we explored the co-variables tumour size and tumour secretory activity (measured by plasma catecholamine concentrations), which influence plasma CGA and found that tumour size and plasma CGA are related but there was no influence of genotype on this relationship. In contrast, plasma CGA was significantly related to tumour secretory activity and the effect of genotype on this relationship narrowly missed significance, but when we expressed plasma CGA as a ratio of plasma catecholamines, plasma CGA was 2-fold greater in MEN 2 patients than VHL patients. Thus despite the tendency of phaeochromocytomas from VHL disease to readily and continuously release their catecholamine stores, plasma CGA levels still appeared to be higher in MEN 2 patients.

Finally, we examined whether the expression of NPY, Leu- enkephalin (Leu-Enk), NAT and the vesicular monoamine transporters type 1 and 2 (VMAT1 and VMAT2,), in normal mouse adrenal glands, and in histologically-confirmed adrenal phaeochromocytomas generated by injected nude mice with a phaeochromocytoma (MPC) cells line. The results of this study established that similar to the rat and human NAT expression is preferentially localised with PNMT within mouse chromaffin cells, while VMAT1 and NPY are found in both PNMT-negative and PNMT-positive cell populations, although expression of NPY was reduced in PNMT-negative cells. In contrast, both VMAT2 and Leu-Enk were found in PNMT-negative noradrenergic cells, and VMAT2 was present in all noradrenergic chromaffin cells while Leu-Enk was observed in a subpopulation of noradrenergic chromaffin cells. In contrast to the normal adrenal but similar to our findings in human phaeochromocytoma, the pattern of marker expression within adrenal phaeochromocytoma lesions of MPC-injected mice are severely disrupted related to both the level of expression of the respective markers, and association with PNMT within the tissue. Thus, the experimentally generated phaeochromocytoma mouse model provides a valuable tool in studying human phaeochromocytoma.

The data presented in this thesis further validate the heterogeneity observed in many aspects of phaeochromocytoma tumour biology, including the expression several chromaffin cell markers such as NAT, NPY and CGA. The altered expression of these markers may contribute to the clinical picture of these tumours, particularly relating to hereditary phaeochromocytoma from VHL and MEN 2 disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chromaffin cells</field><field name="subject">catecholamines</field><field name="subject">noradrenaline</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080526.105525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-Sounding Images: Sound and Image in an Audiovisual Age</field><field name="creator">Collin.Chua@uts.edu.au</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the evolving articulation of sound and image in

Sampling thus encompassed both sub-tropical and temperate waters and the geographical range within which this species is abundant in Western Australia. The resultant data were used to explore the ways in which the biological characteristics of P. auratus differ with latitude and thus water temperature. An intensive sampling regime for eggs and spawning individuals of P. auratus was conducted in Cockburn Sound, a large marine embayment in the Perth region at ca 32oS. The resultant data were used to elucidate where and when spawning occurs in this large marine embayment and to determine more precisely the factors that influence the timing of spawning. The implications of the results presented in this thesis for the management of P. auratus, a species that has been subjected to very heavy fishing pressure in recent years, are discussed.

The time and duration of spawning of P. auratus in the subtropical waters of Carnarvon differed markedly from those recorded for this sparid in the temperate and cooler waters of the Perth and the south coast regions. Spawning at Carnarvon occurred predominantly in the five months between late autumn (May) and mid spring (September), whereas it took place mainly in the three months between mid spring (October) and early summer (December) in the Perth region. Spawning of P. auratus on the south coast occurred predominantly in October and November in 2003 and 2004 and scarcely at all in 2005. Gonadal recrudescence was thus initiated when water temperatures were close to their maximum but declining in Carnarvon, and close to their minima and rising in the Perth and south coast regions, respectively. The prevalence of fully mature and spawning females in all three regions was greatest in those months when water temperatures lay between 19 and 21oC. Collation of the data in this thesis and those provided in the literature for other populations showed that the spawning period was related to latitude, occurring far earlier in sub-tropical than temperate waters.

The females and males attained maturity at a far smaller total length (L50) in the Carnarvon region, i.e. 378 and 353 mm, respectively, than in the Perth region, 585 and 566 mm, respectively, and also the south coast region, i.e. 600 and 586 mm. The trends exhibited by the age at maturity parallel those for length, with the A50s for the two sexes increasing from ca 4 years in Carnarvon to ca 5.6 years in the Perth region and nearly 7 years in the south coast region. The L50 and A50 at maturity thus both increased with increasing latitude.

Marginal increment analysis demonstrated that, irrespective of the number of opaque zones in the otoliths of P. auratus, a single such opaque zone is laid down each year in these otoliths. Furthermore, the trends exhibited by the monthly marginal increments showed that the opaque zone is laid down predominantly in winter in the subtropical waters of Carnarvon, as opposed to mainly in spring in the temperate waters of the Perth and south coast regions. Thus, the timing of formation of the opaque zone in the otoliths of P. auratus along the Western Australian coast is not related to the trends exhibited by water temperature, but, in both the Carnvarvon and Perth regions, was coincident with the timing of spawning.

The maximum total lengths recorded for females and males in the Carnarvon region, i.e. 864 and 840 mm, respectively, were considerably less than the corresponding values of 1051 and 1056 mm in the Perth region, and 1083 and 1099 mm in the south coast region. Growth in the Perth and south coast regions was greater than in Carnarvon, as is reflected in, for example, the respective lengths of 820, 720 and 610 mm for females at 10 years of age, as determined from the von Bertalanffy growth equations.

The length and age compositions in the Carnarvon and south coast regions were essentially unimodal, whereas those in the Perth region were bimodal. However, the &#147;mode&#148; in the length-frequency distribution for the south coast region was located well to the right of that in the Carnarvon region, reflecting relatively lower contributions by individuals of the age cohorts of 3 to 6 years. The marked bimodality in the length-frequency distribution for P. auratus in the Perth region was due to the presence of a group of mainly smaller individuals caught outside Cockburn Sound and another of mainly larger individuals that were caught in Cockburn Sound and which formed part of a spawning aggregation in that embayment.

The proportion of fish &gt; 10 years old in the Carnarvon region declined markedly between 2003 and the following two years, presumably reflecting the effect of heavy fishing pressure. This contributed to the decision by fisheries managers to reduced the TAC in those waters after 2003. Age-frequency data demonstrated that annual recruitment success in Cockburn Sound varied greatly, with the 1991, 1992 and 1996 year classes being particularly strong, and recognizing that the relative numbers of the first two year classes did decline progressively between 2002 and 2004. Annual recruitment was particularly variable in the south coast region, with the catches of the 1996 year class dominating the samples.

The relative number of early stage P. auratus eggs in ichthyoplankton samples collected from Cockburn sound on each of four new moons during the spawning seasons of four consecutive years peaked in November in three of those years, i.e. 2001, 2003 and 2004, and in November/December in the remaining year, i.e. 2002. This showed that spawning in this embayment peaked during these months, at which times the mean sea surface temperatures ranged only from 19 to 20oC.

The prevalence of spawning fraction females in sequential samples demonstrated that spawning peaks at the new and, to a lesser extent, full moons. This helps account for the strong positive correlation between spawning fraction and tidal regime, with spawning being greatest when the tidal range is greatest.

Spawning times, back-calculated from the ages of the eggs collected during ichthyoplankton surveys in Cockburn Sound on each of 16 new moons within the spawning periods of four successive years, demonstrated that, in this embayment, P. auratus spawns at night and within the first three hours of the onset of the ebb tide. The distribution of egg concentrations on the 16 new moons showed that, each year, spawning occurred firstly in the north-eastern area of Cockburn Sound and then in the middle and finally north-western areas of this embayment.

In the Perth region, the marine embayments of Cockburn and Warnbro Sound act as nursery areas for P. auratus during the first two years of life. The majority of 2 to 5 year old fish and a large proportion of the 6 year old fish occupy the marine waters outside the embayments. The remaining 6 year old and almost all of the older fish begin to move in September into particularly Cockburn Sound, where they form relatively large spawning aggregations between October and December, before undergoing a massive emigration from this embayment in December/January. The limited returns from fish that were tagged in Cockburn Sound and were subsequently caught outside this embayment indicate that, following spawning, P. auratus does not tend to move in a particular direction.

Pagrus auratus stocks are heavily exploited in offshore, oceanic waters and in embayments, such as Cockburn Sound, where they are particularly susceptible to capture because of the tendency of this species to form spawning aggregations in these same easily accessible locations each year. The data obtained during this thesis show that the L50 at maturity of females and males in temperate waters, i.e. nearly 600 mm, is far greater than the current minimum legal length (MLL) of 410 mm TL. There is thus a need to increase the MLL and/or reduce fishing pressure on immature individuals in open waters. However, the effectiveness of an increase in the MLL may be limited because there is evidence that P. auratus suffers from fishing-induced barotrauma. Closures of specific areas during the spawning season of P. auratus, such as those that have been applied in Cockburn Sound and Shark Bay, are potentially a very effective method for reducing the effects of heavy fishing on spawning individuals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">snapper</field><field name="subject">pagrus auratus</field><field name="subject">age</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">sparidae</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080530.105016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whitlam and the cities : urban and regional policy and social democratic reform</field><field name="creator">Orchard, Lionel.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 369-402.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SFU</field><field name="subject">Australia.

Unfortunately, many adolescents and young adults experience sexual coercion in their intimate relationships. Sexual coercion is defined broadly as verbal or physical pressure to engage in sexual activity. This study sought to examine sexual coercion experiences of Year 11-12 high school, male and female students in their peer dating and relationships. Before retrieving such information, a modified Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) questionnaire was designed. This was named the Adolescent Dating and Relationship Survey (ADRS) which, subsequently, was examined by experts in the area, and validated via a pilot study using 30 university students. Thirdly, the study administered the ADRS to 341, Year 11 and Year 12 students to examine how they responded to their sexually coercive experiences. The participants were actively engaging in relationship behaviours, with nearly 50% of the females and 70% of the males reporting a relationship with a partner of the same age. However, significantly more females dated older partners and, conversely, more male students were involved with younger partners. The female students tended to have longer relationships than the males, especially for relationships of 9 to 12 months or longer. Participants did not report sexual coercion experiences via threat or blackmail, nor were the males threatened with a weapon. The most frequently cited forms of coercion by both female and male students were: made to feel guilty, being plied with alcohol and/or other drugs, being pressured by begging and/or arguing, and being lied to. However, the female students reported being physically restrained significantly more than the males. As a group they responded to these sexually coercive acts via all forms 2 measured except the males, who did not resort to either fighting off or yelling. Talking about the experience later was the response commonly reported by the students. Further, female students responded to sexual coercion by saying either,</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High school students -- Western Australia -- Perth -- Sexual behavior</field><field name="subject">Sexual behavior surveys -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Teenagers -- Sexual behavior -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Youth -- Sexual behavior -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Video sequence synchronization</field><field name="creator">Wedge, Daniel John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Video sequence synchronization is necessary for any computer vision application that integrates data from multiple simultaneously recorded video sequences. With the increased availability of video cameras as either dedicated devices, or as components within digital cameras or mobile phones, a large volume of video data is available as input for a growing range of computer vision applications that process multiple video sequences. To ensure that the output of these applications is correct, accurate video sequence synchronization is essential. Whilst hardware synchronization methods can embed timestamps into each sequence on-the-fly, they require specialized hardware and it is necessary to set up the camera network in advance. On the other hand, computer vision-based software synchronization algorithms can be used to post-process video sequences recorded by cameras that are not networked, such as common consumer hand-held video cameras or cameras embedded in mobile phones, or to synchronize historical videos for which hardware synchronization was not possible. The current state-of-the-art software algorithms vary in their input and output requirements and camera configuration assumptions. ... Next, I describe an approach that synchronizes two video sequences where an object exhibits ballistic motions. Given the epipolar geometry relating the two cameras and the imaged ballistic trajectory of an object, the algorithm uses a novel iterative approach that exploits object motion to rapidly determine pairs of temporally corresponding frames. This algorithm accurately synchronizes videos recorded at different frame rates and takes few iterations to converge to sub-frame accuracy. Whereas the method presented by the first algorithm integrates tracking data from all frames to synchronize the sequences as a whole, this algorithm recovers the synchronization by locating pairs of temporally corresponding frames in each sequence. Finally, I introduce an algorithm for synchronizing two video sequences recorded by stationary cameras with unknown epipolar geometry. This approach is unique in that it recovers both the frame rate ratio and the frame offset of the two sequences by finding matching space-time interest points that represent events in each sequence; the algorithm does not require object tracking. RANSAC-based approaches that take a set of putatively matching interest points and recover either a homography or a fundamental matrix relating a pair of still images are well known. This algorithm extends these techniques using space-time interest points in place of spatial features, and uses nested instances of RANSAC to also recover the frame rate ratio and frame offset of a pair of video sequences. In this thesis, it is demonstrated that each of the above algorithms can accurately recover the frame rate ratio and frame offset of a range of real video sequences. Each algorithm makes a contribution to the body of video sequence synchronization literature, and it is shown that the synchronization problem can be solved using a range of approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Computer algorithms</field><field name="subject">Digital video</field><field name="subject">Video synchronization</field><field name="subject">Video processing</field><field name="subject">Temporal relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychopathic-like-traits and aggression in suspended mainstream school children and adolescents</field><field name="creator">Cordin, Robin M.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The overall aim of the research reported in this thesis was to explore the viability and utility of the construct of psychopathy and aggression in children and adolescents. Specifically, by taking a developmentally informed approach it sought to develop new instrumentation which measured psychopathic-like-traits, and verbal proactive and reactive aggression in non-referred mainstream school children and adolescents. To achieve this, four separate yet interrelated studies were conducted. Study One comprised three phases relating to the development and validation of two new instruments. In Phase One the instruments currently used to measure psychopathy were reviewed and items relevant to young persons were selected for inclusion in a draft version of the new psychopathy screening instrument. Phase Two, which sought to further explore the construct of psychopathy in children and adolescents, comprised a series of interviews with school principals, deputy principals, psychologists, and education officers at the main juvenile detention centre in Perth, Western Australia. These interviews provided information relating to the behaviour and characteristics of children and adolescents who present with psychopathic-like-traits. As a consequence of the feedback from the Phase Two data, Phase Three reviewed the instrumentation currently used to measure aggression in children and adolescents. From this items were selected for possible inclusion in an aggression questionnaire. The data gathered over these three phases resulted in 117 psychopathy related items being generated for the new instrument, which were subsequently reduced to 56 when duplicated items were identified and the extant knowledge of the construct applied. The 56 items were retained in a draft version of the newly developed instrument, which was named the Child and Adolescent Psychopathy Screening Instrument (CAPSI). The Study One data revealed the instrumentation used to date provided few measures of physical and verbal aggression - a characteristic of psychopathic-like behaviour. Thus, a review of instrumentation together with the information from the interviews resulted in 63 aggression items being generated.  ... Study Four utilised information from the CAPSI and the CASA in conjunction with in-depth interviews to generate case studies to further elucidate the characteristics of children and adolescents with psychopathic-like-traits and extreme aggression. Case studies were undertaken with seven male students ranging in age from 8 to 15 years who had been suspended from mainstream schools. All boys scored very highly on the new instruments. All presented with extreme aggression, with some exhibiting proactive or premeditated aggression combined with a superficially engaging personality, insincere charm, lack of remorse, and lack of empathy. The findings from all four research studies are discussed in the light of the literature reviewed and the aims of the research. Implications are then drawn for researchers and clinicians, and directions for further research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychoses in children -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Adolescent psychopathology -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Aggressiveness in adolescence -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Aggressiveness in children -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Reactive aggression</field><field name="subject">Proactive aggression</field><field name="subject">Psychopathic-like-traits</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The piping of the shepherd : meaning as myth in the pastoral novels of Thomas Hardy</field><field name="creator">Biggs, David J.

The complexes studied include donor (D) monomers like vinyl ethers and vinyl acetate (VA) with acceptor (A) monomers such as maleic anhydride (MA). Both UV and EB have been utilised as radiation sources. The complexes are directly grafted to these substrates in the presence of radiation. The complexes yield novel copolymers when radiation cured with concurrent grafting improving the properties of the finished product. The term cure grafting has been proposed for this concurrent grafting process. Studies in basic photografting work to complement the cure grafting have been proposed. The role of solvent in grafting is discussed, particularly the effect of aromatics in photografting to naturally occurring trunk polymers like wool and cellulose. The effect of the double bond molar ratio (DBMR) of the DA components in grafting is examined. The ultraviolet (UV) conditions for gel formation during photografting, hence the importance of homopolymer yields in these processes is reported. A plausible mechanism to explain the results from this photografting work is proposed. The significance of these photografting studies in the related field of curing, especially in UV and ionising radiation (EB) systems, is discussed. EB curing and cure grafting of charge transfer (CT) monomer complexes is investigated. The EB results are compared with UV curing and cure grafting of the same complexes. The work has been extended to include EB/UV curing and cure grafting of thiolene systems. The significance of these results in the potential commercial application of these complexes is discussed. Variables affecting the UV/EB curing and cure grafting of thiolenes on cellulose have been studied. These include effect of varying the type of olefin, increasing the functionality of the thiol, use of acrylate monomers and oligomers in hybrid systems, altering the surface structure of the cellulose and finally the role of air in these processes particularly with EB. Photopolymerisation of the thiol-enes in bulk has also been investigated. The thesis content is based on the published work of 14 research papers over the course of the project.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radiation curing</field><field name="subject">electron donor-acceptor complexes</field><field name="subject">graft copolymers</field><field name="subject">photopolymerization</field><field name="subject">polymers</field><field name="subject">curing</field><field name="subject">photochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Watermana</field><field name="creator">Tapper, Jess Brian</field><field name="description">Watermana is a concept, the title of this thesis and the title of the work produced in conjunction with this thesis.

It reflects finding connections with Celtic shamanistic practices, and utilizing them in a modern urban context. It also explores poetry, its relationship to shamanism, and its possible structural relationships to film. 'Watermana' is a twelve-minute video produced using three-dimensional computer modelling and animation and live video, edited and composited digitally.

This thesis challenges this underlying assumption of human behaviour in the context of the non-durable consumption expenditure decision making process. In doing so, our attention will be placed upon the weak or more general form of the hypothesis, which has come to be known as optimisation. We employ a behavioural methodology in an attempt to ascertain if individuals adhere to the optimising or satisficing model of human behaviour. In doing so time will be spent examining the bounded rationality hypothesis. We also employ a behavioural methodology in producing a non-durable consumption function that is econometrically comparable with an optimising model of non-durable consumption expenditure (namely the permanent income rational expectations hypothesis). The micro results produced in this thesis suggest that the respondents surveyed from non-durable consumption expenditure decisions that are sub-optimal in nature. The formation of these sub-tropical expenditure decisions appear to be a consequence of the cognitive constraints faced by our respondents, which in turn provides empirical support for the bounded rationality hypothesis. On a macro level, our behavioural consumption function generates results that are comparable with those produced by the optimising model employed in this thesis. Our results also question the rational expectations permanent income hypothesis (as it is usually applied), despite making adjustments to the model which remove the underlying assumption of known, constant real interest use</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">non-durable</field><field name="subject">human behaviour</field><field name="subject">Muthian</field><field name="subject">rational economic agents</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participatory decision making : new democracy or new delirium?</field><field name="creator">Spriggs, Shelley</field><field name="description">Ever since the laborious consultation process to set the National Greenhouse Response Strategy (1991-1992), stakeholder 'consultation' has been something Australian governments do. Or attempt to do. A recent trend in NSW in particular has been to expand the concept and practice of consultation to multi-party, collaborative decision-making, also referred to as participatory democracy. One such initiative officially begun in August 1997 is the River Management Committee (RMC) exercise. For this tremendous outlay of financial and human resources, the government is taking a punt that the committee will deliver better decisions, and more timely actions, on river flows and water quality in each of the major regulated river valleys in the state. The set up and first year of operation of the RMC exercise is the subject of this thesis. Specifically it examines the design of the process and its appropriateness to the task at hand; the reality of consensus decision-making amongst people with opposing views; the democratic ideal of participants learning to be 'other directed' in terms of putting aside their own positions to work for the common good; and affordability of such exercises from both the government and non-government participants' points of view. The themes emerging from this thesis have become the focus for further research.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water quality management (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">river quality (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">River Management Committee</field><field name="subject">Macquarie River (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Darling River (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Lachlan River (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An anatomical study of the development of the sense of taste</field><field name="creator">Segovia, Carolina</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to quantify the density of taste pores on the anterior region of the tongue, in adult males and 8 to 9 year old boys. Earlier studies had shown that, although 8 to 9 year olds were poorer than adults at sensing the tastant sucrose using a whole mouth procedure, localised regions of the tongue in male children were more sensitive than equivalent regions in adults. This study aims to detemine whether the age differences in sensitivity is related to a difference in taste pore density. Two areas of the tongue, for which children had previously been shown to have higher sensitivity than adults, were examined using a videomicrosocpy technique and the number and diameter of taste pores were measured. Children were found to have a greater density of taste pores, however the number of taste pores per papilla were similar in children and adults. It was found to be likely that the greater sensitivity of localised areas on the children's tongue is due to a greater taste pore density. The reduced sensitivity reported using whole mouth stimulation may be due to a reduced capacity to assimilate taste input from the whole mouth or due to different relative contributions to whole-mouth taste from the various receptive fields in the mouth.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fungiform papilla</field><field name="subject">taste pores</field><field name="subject">taste buds</field><field name="subject">anatomy of tongue</field><field name="subject">sensory evaluation of food</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the use of plant growth regulators on phytoremediation</field><field name="creator">Fuentes, Hector D.</field><field name="description">Phytoremediation is a relatively new technology that uses plants for the clean up of contaminated soils.Its low cost, simplicity and environmentally friendly approach make this technology a viable option for remediation but the main drawback is that it must be considered as long term alternative given its slow speed.

Hermes Recidivus examines key figurations operating within both the imaginaries of Hermeticism and modern(ist) science with a view to developing a postmodern critical position in regard to the discourse of the modernist scientific project. It is proposed that a re-examination of the notions surrounding these key figurations may provide new hermeneutical tools, and that the imaginary of Hermeticism represents a potentially rich resource from which to develop alternative modes of critical enquiry. It is furthermore proposed that the mechanism by which these Hermetic resonances are perpetuated within the discourse of modernist science takes the form of a logic of the imaginary associated with key figurations within Hermeticism. Certain figural elements associated with the Hermetic imaginary seem to possess a constancy that travels across temporal and disciplinary barriers, encouraging the assumption that these figures are central organising principles within both Hermeticism and modern science. Specifically these figurations are those of the anima mundi and the Gnostic 'alien light' or spintheros. It is proposed that these figurations take the form of 'ideal objects' within both the discourses of Hermeticism and modernist science. The individual chapters respectively examine the relevance of the Hermetic imaginary to Artificial Intelligence research and cybernetic theory; occidental and oriental traditions of the 'subtle body' and their relevance to developing a postmodern perspective on the question of mind-body dualism; the 'metaphysical geometry' of key figures within the Hermetic and Kabbalistic traditions and their resonances within mathematical 'catastrophe theory' as developed by Rene Thom; the Hermetic alchemy of Robbert Fludd as revealed in his text Truth's Golden Harrow, and its relevance in regard to the subject-object split of modern(ist) scientific consciousness and, finally, the influence of Kabbalistic and Hermetic figuration on the development of Leibniz's monadological philosophy and on the notion of the 'field' in contemporary physical theory</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hermetism</field><field name="subject">gnostic</field><field name="subject">mind-body dualism</field><field name="subject">kabbalistic traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Shaman archetype : a contemporary Jungian examination</field><field name="creator">Merchant, John Frederick</field><field name="description">Since Jung&#8217;s first allusions to it, the shaman &#8220;archetype&#8221; has occupied a place of considerable importance in Jungian discourse. The trajectory of this thesis began with Guggenbuhl-Craig&#8217;s (1999) view that a &#8220;shaman archetype&#8221; must be present in Jungian analysts for them to be good at their craft. To explicate the nature and characteristics of this archetype, this thesis examined both aspects of the phrase &#8220;shaman archetype&#8221;. It was necessary to examine Jung&#8217;s classical view of archetypes and certain critiques emerged. It was concluded, after investigation, that an emergent/developmental model of archetype was supported most by current research findings. This led to a working model of archetype which enabled further exploration of the &#8220;shaman archetype&#8221; question. The second part of the thesis applied this emergent /developmental model of the archetype to Siberian shamanism by seeing if there was evidence that its central characteristic of the &#8220;pre-initiatory illness&#8221; could be explained developmentally. It was concluded that Jungian analysts need the same kind of personality structure to be able to work with and use the somatic countertransference as a psychotherapeutic tool. A comparison and contrast of these ideas with contemporary uses of shamanism was then undertaken so that the implications for the training and selection of Jungian analysts could be deduced.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shamanism</field><field name="subject">archetype (psychology)</field><field name="subject">Jungian psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecules in southern molecular clouds: a millimetre-wave study of dense cores</field><field name="creator">Hunt, Maria.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an observational study of molecular abundances in the dense cores of 27 prominent molecular clouds in the southern galactic plane.The molecular abundances and physical conditions in dense condensations have been derived from millimetre-wavelength observations of molecular rotational transitions.The study has produced a comprehensive data set of transition intensities and abundances for 10 different molecules in bright southern molecular clouds, and the general characteristics of emissions from these molecules such as optical depth, excitation and relative abundances are discussed.

This thesis analyses, compares and evaluates spatial practice in two local parks of Bogot&#225;, Colombia. Spatial practice in this research is defined according to Lefebvre&#8217;s writing on the production of space. Spatial practice refers to the sensorial level of spatial phenomena; it involves uses, interactions, perceptions, influences and transformations in the everyday relationships between space and people. The two parks under investigation are located in and belong to different socioeconomic areas and the cross-class comparison of parks and spatial practice is important in a highly segregated city such as Bogot&#225;. Locally, the two parks are part of the innovative municipal government program, &#8216;Parks for Learning How to Live,&#8217; (1998-2000).This project transformed public space physically as well as residents&#8217; perceptions of public space, parks, and outdoor recreation and leisure. The research design was qualitative because it sought information on perceptions, uses and feelings of park users.The findings identified that despite the two parks being similar in terms of their physical characteristics, they display different spatial practices that in turn reflect the socio-economic status, history, and expectations of the communities that use them. This research provides an in-depth analysis of the spatial practice in these two parks in order to start building a bottom-up framework that may be instrumental for future planning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parks</field><field name="subject">Bogota&#769; (Colombia)</field><field name="subject">public spaces</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the social effects of visual loss on human interaction</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Claire Louise</field><field name="description">Theories on the impact of visual loss tend to generalise and can simplify complex issues.

The issue of fairness becomes more critical and must be well addressed. The aim of this thesis is to investigate security solutions with fairness for on-line transactions. A fair trading protocol with credit payment is proposed. The proof of equivalence of discrete logarithm to discrete loglogarithm is employed as the main tool to construct the protocol. The scheme provides a unique link between payment and gambling outcome so that the winner can be ensured to get the payment. Since an optimal fair exchange method is used in gambling message exchange, the proposed system guarantees that no one can successfully cheat during a gambling process. Our system requires an off-line Trusted Third Party (TTP). If cheating occurs, the TTP can resolve the problem and make the gambling process fair. An efficient and secure poker scheme is proposed. It is based on multiple encryption and decryption of individual cards. The protocol satisfies all major security requirements of a real mental poker. It gets rid of the Card Salesman and guarantees minimal effect due to collusion. The protocol is secure and more efficient compared with other known protocols. The strategies of players can be kept confidential with the introduction of a Dealer. The protocol is suitable to be implemented in an on-line gambling card game. The implementation of the fair on-line gambling protocol has been demonstrated and all utility classes for the implementation have been defined.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">on-line gambling</field><field name="subject">security solutions</field><field name="subject">fair electronic gambling</field><field name="subject">encryption</field><field name="subject">decryption</field><field name="subject">gambling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclodextrins as potential human anti-atherosclerotic agents</field><field name="creator">Martinic, Goran (Gary)</field><field name="description">Cyclodextrins (CDs) are naturally occurring cyclic oligosaccharides.

In searching for Malaysian approach to alter this trend, this thesis is written against a background of concern for a balanced development in economy and social wellbeing and simultaneously preserving the environment. The aim of the study is to identify an alternative approach in managing the local environment for health, starting from a value position of regard for local knowledge and abilities, and for scientists and administrators working together with local knowledge and abilities, and for scientists and administrators working together with local communities in their natural settings. Findings from this study offer a range of lessons for those who wish to integrate local and scientific knowledge. The research approach proved capable of documenting the separate realities of the place-based and the knowledge-based communities within a common interpretative framework. The place-based communities held realistic interpretations of their capacity to contribute to local sustainable development, distinct from one another and also distinct from the same events as perceived by the scientific community. The conclusion is drawn that each needs the other for any effective local application of scientific findings or government support. Finally, this has not been a study of top-down or bottom up but from the 'inside-out' with a small study of the 'outside-in.' It offers another perspective and an extra set of tools or strategies for the professionals' community to work with local communities in their environmental management for health.

The error in measurement produced by quantum principles was found to be half that produced by a classical approach. In some circumstances the ratio of a pixel's coordinates and that of velocities could be determined using quantum eigenstate theory.

The intent was to study farmer decision making to see how DSS could be used to deliver information and procedures on climate risk to farmers more effectively. The study investigated whether there are significant differences between farmers' subjective distributions of seasonal rainfall and its derivatives (such as crop yield and fallow recharge) and a probability distribution derived from long-term records and simulation models, and whether these differences in risk assessment lead to changes in the optimum decision. Subjective probability distributions of rainfall and its derivatives were collected from farmers and advisers and it was found the overall match between these and long term records and simulation models was close. This study found little evidence to support the role of DSS for routine decision making, but this does not lessen the value of distributions derived from simulation models.

Potted plants were grown in soil under well watered conditions, in artificially lit environmentally controlled cabinets or naturally lit greenhouses at varying levels of CO2 enrichment. CO2 enrichment enhanced the dry weight of C3 and C4 Panicum species under optimal light and N supplies, but had no effect on the total leaf N or TNC concentrations. The high-CO2 induced photosynthetic reaction in the C3 species was accompanied by a reduced Rubisco concentration and was related to the conservation of the relative growth rate of the plant. Elevated CO2 had no effect on the photosynthetic capacity of the C4 species, but enhanced its CO2 assimilation rates under high light and N supplies. The effect of elevated CO2 on the leaf and stem anatomy reflected increased carbon supply at high CO2 in the C3 grass, and reduced transpiratory demand at high CO2 in C4 grasses.

The Dramatistic Approach is an organisational inquiry method, based on a notion of ?script?, which assists people in organisations to discuss interpersonal communication problems. A ?script? is defined in this document as being an unconscious socialised social routine. The purpose of this thesis is to document an inquiry into ?Human sculpture?, a process using dramatisation to facilitate discussion about the notion of ?script? in the organisational setting. The inquiry method is action research in the post positivist research paradigm, and is written in four chapters. The use of the notion ?script? within the disciplines of therapy and organizational studies is examined. The appropriateness of the positivist paradigm for human inquiry is debated, reaching the conclusion that a post positivist paradigm needs to underpin a human inquiry of the nature of the inquiry about ?Human sculpture?. The nine cycles of the inquiry are documented. The learnings which have emerged from this inquiry are discussed, addressing the primary focus of the inquiry, the procedure and facilitation of ?Human sculpture?, as well as two secondary focii which emerged, the notion of ?script? and the facilitation of a human inquiry</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workplace relations</field><field name="subject">communication in organizations</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">group relations training</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orchestrated partitioning of maternal nutrients during ovine pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Regnault, Timothy Robert Hume</field><field name="description">Ovine placental lactogen (oPL) is postulated to be involved in the repartitioning of maternal nutrients during pregnancy, through its effect on insulin metabolism. Ovine pancreatic insulin responses to exogenous glucose are depressed during pregnancy and this depression becomes more pronounced as gestation advances. In addition, under the hormonal environment of rising oPL and growth hormone (oGH) concentrations, maternal whole body glucose irreversible loss (GIL) increases. The percentage of GIL accounted for by uterine glucose uptake also increases with advancing gestation and increasing litter size. Regression analysis of oPL concentration with glucose uterine uptake as a percentage of GIL, accounts for 39% of variation. Maternal oPL concentrations which increase with gestational age, were significantly greater in multiple bearing ewes and ewes subjected to reduced metabolisable energy (ME) intakes. It is postulated that through actions on pancreatic sensitivity, oPL plays a major role as a homeorhetic control during pregnancy. Elevated oPL concentrations were strongly associated with continually depressed pancreatic insulin secretory ability. The reduction in pancreatic sensitivity to glucose was not as a result of elevation in GH or non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. Muscle insulin receptor number and affinity were found to increase with increasing litter size, suggesting that pregnancy associated insulin resistance occurs predominantly in adipose tissue. During ovine pregnancy there is a specific stimulation of maternal gluconeogenesis. As gestation advances, an increasingly greater proportion of this glucose is partitioned to the gravid uterus. The development of insulin resistance, together with the suppression of pancreatic activity, ensures the preferential uptake of glucose by non-insulin dependent tissues over insulin dependent tissues. These activities favour uterine glucose uptake, decrease adipose glucose uptake, and also promote adipose mobilisation and hepatic gluconeogenesis, so as to meet the increasing energy requirement of pregnancy. It is postulated that through these effects on insulin secretion and associated adipose tissue mobilisation factors, oPL plays a major role in homeorhesis during pregnancy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ovine pregnancy</field><field name="subject">maternal nutrients</field><field name="subject">ovine placental lactogen (oPL)</field><field name="subject">insulin metabolism</field><field name="subject">glucose irreversible loss (GIL)</field><field name="subject">uterine glucose uptake</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of B lymphocyte commitment.</field><field name="creator">Pridans, Clare</field><field name="description">The transcription factor Pax5 is essential for commitment to the B lineage as the development of these cells is arrested at an early stage in the bone marrow of Pax5 deficient mice. Pax5 deficient pro-B cells display remarkable plasticity and are able to differentiate into other cell lineages both in vitro and in vivo. Several Pax5 target genes have been previously reported but none are able to explain the developmental block observed at the early to late pro-B cell stage. To determine the exact mechanisms by which Pax5 controls B cell development, I have undertaken a cDNA microarray screen with a custom generated B cell-specific cDNA library. By identifying genes that are differentially expressed between Pax5 deficient and wild type pro-B cells, I have identified a number of potential Pax5 target genes. The microarray screen identified lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (Lrmp or Jaw1) as a novel Pax5 activated transcript. Using RT-PCR and a Pax5-estrogen receptor inducible system, I confirmed that Jaw1 is a direct Pax5 target gene whose expression is confined, in resting cells, to the earliest stages of B and T cell development. The biological relevance of Jaw1 for cell fate specification has been tested by transducing bone marrow progenitor cells with murine retroviral vectors and reconstituting haemopoiesis in vivo. I have reported that over-expression of Jaw1 in these cells results in a decrease in the development of B and NK lymphocytes and a marked increase in the development of myeloid cells in the bone marrow of reconstituted mice. This result suggests that Jaw1 may play an important role in the early development of lymphocytes in the bone marrow. Whilst initial analysis of Jaw1 deficient mice has revealed no overt defects in lymphopoiesis, I postulate that Jaw1 is involved in IP3-induced calcium signaling downstream of the pre-BCR and BCR. This hypothesis has resulted from analysis of the function of IRAG, the only known Jaw1 homologue combined with data that Jaw1 is expressed in early B cells in the BM as well as in germinal centers in the spleen. Pax5 mutant mice usually die before weaning and the cause of death is currently unknown, suggesting that Pax5 is expressed in a previously unreported tissue. To investigate this hypothesis I produced a monoclonal antibody to Pax5 and screened for novel expression domains during embryonic development and also in neonate mice. These studies did not detect any new Pax5 expression domains, but did reveal that this antibody cross-reacts with Pax2 and/or Pax8 in the developing kidney and brain. Biochemical analysis of the serum from Pax5 deficient mice also did not reveal the likely cause of death in these animals, beyond the general signs of dehydration and starvation that are likely to be secondary to the underlying defect.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lymphocytes</field><field name="subject">immunoglobulins</field><field name="subject">B cells</field><field name="subject">transcription factors</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the management of Muntjac Deer (Muntiacus muntjak) in Bali Barat National Park, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Oka, Gusti Made</field><field name="description">The principal aim of the study which was conducted between May 1995 and May 1997 was to collect and analyze information that would be considered vital to any future management actions that may be applied to the deer living in the wild in the Bali Barat National Park ecosystem in Indonesia. The systems approach used sought to analyze the complex interactions between the soil, plant, animal and human activity subsystems. In particular, interaction between Rusa deer and Muntjac deer was compared where possible, although the principal focus of the study was on the population of Muntjac deer. The soils in habitats frequented by deer in Bali Barat National Park were found to be of relatively low fertility status. Chemical analysis of the soil revealed that all of the mineral element contents considered in this study were in the lowest range for soils, in general. During this study the population of Muntjac deer in the Bali Barat National Park was submitted to phylogenetic analysis to determine whether the Bali population is distinct. Preliminary results indicate that these deer are apart of a diverse, but monophyletic group of Muntiacus Muntjac. The potential unique status of Muntjac deer in Bali Barat National Park, and the need to preserve them as part of the natural resource base that constitutes the Indonesian archipelago increased the importance of this study of the ecosystem and social system surrounding Bali Barat National Park.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Bali Barat National Park</field><field name="subject">Muntjac deer</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">ecosystem</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">human activity</field><field name="subject">plant</field><field name="subject">systems approach</field><field name="subject">Rusa</field><field name="subject">phylogenetic analysis</field><field name="subject">Muntiacus Muntjak</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors associated with the occurrence of Ecchymosis (Blood splash) in fallow deer (Dama dama)</field><field name="creator">Falepau, David F.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes experimental work conducted to define factors associated with the occurrence of ecchymosis (blood splash) in fallow deer, and discusses facets of the Australian venison processing sector with respect to its capacity to improve the quality of venison.

A range of factors has contributed to this situation including changes in staffing levels, patient acuity, resourcing of the healthcare system and nurse recruitment and retention. A number of studies on the intensive care environment have identified factors that cause stress and role strain in nurses. Other research has explored the coping mechanisms these nurses implement to manage work stresses. To date, no Australian studies have sought to provide an encompassing explanation of why and how nurses choose to remain working in this challenging area of practice. This study seeks to develop one possible explanation for this phenomenon. Grounded theory was selected as the most appropriate means of achieving this aim. It explores behavioural patterns and how these develop into interactive social processes. Grounded theory investigates and reveals how people manage problematic life situations, enabling emergence of a substantive theory, which is grounded in context and situation dependent research data. This research study was undertaken in three intensive care units in one area health service in New South Wales. The constant comparative analysis method was used, revealing that nursing in the intensive care environment is a stimulating, challenging experience, which at times is also frustrating and demoralising. The emergent substantive theory was titled &#8220;Traversing the path of the intensive care nursing experience&#8221;. This study achieves two objectives. It adds to the accumulated knowledge base related to intensive care nursing by offering an explanation of why and how these specialist nurses remain practising at the bedside. It substantiates the results from previous research that investigated stressors and stress management in nursing within the intensive care environment. There are a number of implications for nursing education, research and practice that can be drawn from this study. Impacting on all levels of nursing, these include the development of effective stress management, interpersonal communication techniques, recognition of competence and its assessment, and conflict mediation and management. Further research is needed into understanding nurses&#8217; self-concept and the effect of the working environment on the delivery of effective nursing practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intensive care nursing</field><field name="subject">stress management</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate of the neurotoxic mycotoxin, cyclopiazonic acid in dairy products</field><field name="creator">Boupha, Prasongsidh C.</field><field name="description">The aim of the study in this thesis was to assess the stability of the mycotoxin, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) in milk and dairy products processed from contaminated milk. A method was developed to detect CPA in milk and milk products using micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC), a technique of capillary electrophoresis (CE), which was rapid and non-labour-intensive. The quantifying efficiency of CE in detecting CPA was compared to Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography. Heat-stability of CPA in milk was assessed under different conditions. A longer heat treatment of 60 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes led to a 10% decrease in the level of CPA. The results from this thesis demonstrate that CPA in milk at concentrations found in naturally contaminated milk could not be eliminated by the heat-treatment during milk processing, storage, processing and manufacture of dairy products. Occurrence of CPA in cheese curd, butter or cream following manufacture with contaminated milk was demonstrated. CPA is left in milk despite UV-visible radiation treatment with or without hydrogen peroxide and/or riboflavin. Chemical treatment, which is capable of completely eliminating CPA, is prohibited and impractical to use for milk treatment. Stability of CPA in milk and milk products confirms the potential of the toxin to reach consumers of dairy products.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mycotoxin</field><field name="subject">cyclopiazonic acid</field><field name="subject">CPA</field><field name="subject">contaminated milk</field><field name="subject">heat</field><field name="subject">dairy products</field><field name="subject">manufacture</field><field name="subject">riboflavin</field><field name="subject">toxin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lexis versus text : the case for translating English legal texts into Arabic</field><field name="creator">Karakira, Steve</field><field name="description">The thesis explores the nature of the difficulties involved in translating legal texts, focusing mainly on translating English legal texts into Arabic. It shows that these difficulties fall into two categories, structural and terminological. the latter being more problematical. The language of law is distinct, rigid, precise and too formal. The difficulty arises when a translator's exposure to the cultural and legal environments of his working languages is unbalanced. This could lead a translator to misunderstand not only the significance of the specialised terms used, but also the distinctive features of syntax and register of the original language text. The other, and more significant, difficulty arises from the lack of equivalence at the term level in the two languages. The research was conducted in two parts. In the first part, original legal texts in both English and Arabic were analysed, and the linguistic exponents extracted and compared. In the second part of the research, the development process of the English and Arabic legal terminology were considered, and the differences in terminology imposed by the different nature of the legal environments explored, including the adversarial versus inquisitorial systems. An empirical study concludes the thesis. It consists of a questionnaire and a list of legal terms which twenty translators were asked to complete. The results of the research are quite controversial. The argument is that difficulties involved in legal translations are more conceived than real in so far as textual, syntactic and structural features are concerned. The similarities between English and Arabic legal texts in this respect are striking. The confusion and indecisiveness which usually reign when translating English legal texts into Arabic will be alleviated through providing examples from contemporary Arabic legal texts, accompanied by textual and linguistic analyses. The real difficulty is in the field of terminology. However, a corpus of terms in the criminal code is discussed, focusing on terms with direct application to the Australian situation. This should be of direct benefit to Arabic translators and interpreters in Australia and other English-speaking countries.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legal</field><field name="subject">terms</field><field name="subject">terminology</field><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">translators</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">Arabic</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">text</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="subject">Islamic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action research to improve the pumpkin industry in Tonga</field><field name="creator">Toafa, Tevita</field><field name="description">Agricultural industries play a key role in promoting the economic prosperity and growth of Tongan society. Agricultural exports, such as the pumpkin industry, receive foreign exchange to pay for the imports. This project aims to develop an understanding of the problems involved in exporting pumpkins from Tonga to the Japanese rice market. It also aims, as an action research project, to increase the understanding of the problem owners in order to improve the operation of the industry. The inquiry explores the perceived problems and concerns of all parties involved in the development of the industry including the exporters, farmers, government departments and the Tongan Development Bank as well as the Japanese pumpkin importers. The study used a systems approach, utilising action research methodology as an entry point to conduct a collaborative inquiry. A market analysis of the niche market of the pumpkin industry was carried out.The following have been identified as the most important factors in the development of the industry. (1) It was found that low quality standard of pumpkin exports has been the main concern as it hinders the development of the niche market. (2) Insufficient government support services have also contributed to the low quality standard. Partly as a result of the action research project a strategic plan for the industry was developed and this has already led to changes in industry practices.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pumpkin industry</field><field name="subject">Tonga</field><field name="subject">farmers attitudes (Tonga)</field><field name="subject">agricultural innovations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Sahelian food security through facilitating action learning : a case study among the Fulbe Jelgobe of Northern Burkina Faso</field><field name="creator">Weekley, Paul</field><field name="description">The Fulbe Jelgobe, like many other Sahelian pastoral groups, are becoming increasingly vulnerable to chronic food insecurity. They live in a landscape that exhibits a complex patchiness and extremely variable rainfall patterns. When their food security is threatened, the Fulbe Jelgobe act skillfully on the basis of local knowledge in employing a complex array of coping responses that seek to meet immediate food needs while preserving a base for future livelihood activity. These responses involve the manipulation of household asset portfolios, modifying household consumption patterns, access to common property resources and the activation of networks of social relationships. The reinforcement or enhancement of such responses is a credible means of improving food security. This thesis reports on an attempt to apply action research amongst the Fulbe Jelgobe in Northern Burkina Faso, focusing on case studies of action research in two Fulbe communities. These communities provide the context for understanding a particular food insecurity situation by taking action to improve it. The process was co-designed and co-managed by action research groups formed in both locations. These groups included diverse stakeholders who cooperated with me in learning how to contextualise the Participatory Action Research process to improving local food security. A third, general action research process is underpinned by ten years of previous experience in the area and ethnographic research that provides an understanding of the context for Fulbe subsistence strategies. While the process of participatory Action Research is perceived to be useful in such vulnerable livelihood contexts, the participatory process itself is viewed as problematic and frequently more partisan than many adherents to the process would accept. There is a complex web of motivations driving local stakeholders participation. Rather than extended dialogue aimed at achieving consensus, as many popular participatory approaches envisage, it is a matter of continually re-negotiating cooperation among stakeholders with diverse interests and capabilities in order to secure continuing participation in a heuristic learning process. Treating Fulbe agro-pastoralism holistically as social praxis, a locally managed Participatory Action Research process facilitated improved food security by reinforcing coping options and enhancing local organisational capacity to interface with development organisations. Participatory Action Research provided a framework for the design and management of food-for-work programs aimed at developing an infrastructure for dry-season gardening in both locations. The action research group in one location became the management committee of an association of some 80 people that was formally registered with the government under the name of Dewral. This association, which is still functioning, facilitates the cultivation of 25 hectares of lakeside gardens. These gardens are an important addition to the members' mix of food procuring activities.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action researching my practice as a facilitator of experiential learning with pastoralist farmers in central west Queensland</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Gerard Michael O'Brien</field><field name="description">My thesis document is contextualised as a three year study of my practice as a facilitator of experiential learning with pastoralist farmers in my role as an agricultural extension officer. In the study I used an action research methodology to provide change and understanding in situations in which it was too difficult to control variables. In my use of the methodology, action provided change and research provided understanding. The action research methodology also provided rigour through the spiral of its cyclic process. Within the agricultural extension context, my learning outcomes about my role in working participatively and collaboratively with pastoralists, prompted significant change in my practice of facilitation. The change enabled us as an experiential learning group facilitated by an agricultural extension officer, to provide for pastoralist participants to increasingly direct their own learning. From reflection on the project observations that led to my working more collaboratively and participatively, I theorise that improved facilitation practice can derive from personal and collaborative reflection as a part of action researching. My reflection, during the process of thesis writing allowed me to use action science to demonstrate that my improved facilitiation practice came about from enhanced congruency of theories of action of participation and collaboration. Personally, I developed a more congruent practice of participation and collaboration through action researching my practice of facilitating experiential learning with pastoralists, and by reflecting on the emergent outcomes for me as the facilitator. This thesis concludes with my consideration of whether or not my specific learning outcomes may provide a foundation for some cautious expansion of the emergent outcomes of the action research such that they may be of interest to others in extension.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">farmers</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">farming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A total quality management approach to appropriate clinical laboratory test utilisation in acute myocardial infarction</field><field name="creator">Isouard, Godfrey</field><field name="description">The first goal of this investigation was to undertake a non-equivalent quasi-experimental design to test the effect of a total Quality management (TQM) approach to improve the appropriateness of clinical laboratory test utilisation in the management of early acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The study was conducted at 2 public hospitals in Sydney over a 30 month period, and in 2 stages- pre and post TQM intervention. Using specifically a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) FOCUS-PDCA model, a multidisciplinary team was empowered to make appropriate changes in order to improve a variety of problem areas that affected the total pathology service. Improvement was directed at the total system of pathology testing, not just test ordering. It was observed that the introduction of a TQM environment had provided a more committed, integrated and motivated clinical care effort towards improving the appropriateness of test ordering. Such team efforts were accompanied by demonstrated customer satisfaction at various aspects of the laboratory service and further benefits to patient care. Patient care benefited greatly from the highly significant changes towards more appropriate timing of blood collections for cardiac enzyme testing. Other improvements included overall improvements to the turnaround time of test results, reductions in specimen delivery delays, more appropriate use of clinical laboratory tests, a streamlined distribution of printed reports and marked improvements in communication between staff involved in the process of test ordering. Of major importance was the finding that CQI strategies resulted in substantial savings of 23.0% of the overall cost of pathology services. Adoption of the TQM approach appears to be a strategy worthy of exploration by laboratory directors and health administrators interested in improving patient care while at the same time reducing expenditure.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">total quality management</field><field name="subject">scientific approach</field><field name="subject">patient tests</field><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">myocardial</field><field name="subject">pathology</field><field name="subject">infarction</field><field name="subject">CQI</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Authenticity and the representative paradox: the political representation of Australian farmers through the NFF family of interest groups</field><field name="creator">Halpin, Darren Richard.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the political representation of Australian farmers. The NFF family of interest groups is charged with the political representation of farmers in Australia.Given that their state affiliates are the only organisations that farmers can directly join, this study takes the case of the New South Wales Farmers' Association (NSWFA) as its major reference point. A paradox is immediately confronted. On one hand, both the state and commentators refer to the NFF family as an exemplar of a successful modern interest group. However, on the other, the NFF family is being confronted with escalating levels of disillusionment and criticism from its own constituency.Two points of interest are highlighted. Firstly, it is suggested that theoretical frameworks, which assist commentators and researchers to come to the conclusion that the NFF family is 'successful', are not constructed in such a fashion as to throw sufficient light on the paradoxical nature of an existing situation. Secondly, this paradox suggests that the NFF itself must be able to disassociate the contingent relationship between its internal levels of support and external levels of access and influence. These two focal points are explored in this thesis, and the framework used by researchers to understand the actions of Australian farm interest groups are scrutinised. Discussing 'authentic' political representation assists considering the major theme of the 'representative paradox'. It is argued that this paradox is best understood by locating it within a search by farmers for authentic political representation - both through the NFF family and apart from it.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian farmers</field><field name="subject">politics and farming</field><field name="subject">agriculture and politics</field><field name="subject">farm interest groups</field><field name="subject">New South Wales Farmers' Association</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic manipulation of baker's yeast for improved maltose utilisation</field><field name="creator">Yip, Hopi</field><field name="description">Two yeast/E.coli shuttle vector plasmids were studied in 1994, termed pIBIDB and pBP33.

Methods such as restriction analysis, polymerase chained reaction (PCR), sequencing, plate assays and enzyme assays were used to identify and evaluate the novel inserts. The data presented in this thesis suggest the inserted ADH2UAS fragment did enhance the production of maltose permease and maltase when the transformants were cultivated in maltose and ethanol-glycerol medium. The results suggested that transformants containing two inserts of ADH2UAS had a greater influence on the transformants than a single insert.

This thesis examines the relative influence of environmental social controls on the acceptability of capital investment and provides insight into the perceptions of Australian managers concerning capital investment decision-making. An experiment is used to measure the relative influence of the four social control measures. This is supported by a survey to gauge firm size and industry influences and also a range of attributes of the controls on the capital investment decision. Experiment results suggest that the influence of stakeholder opinion on capital investment is very high and mandatory disclosure very low. The survey measured the influence of a range of indicators of each control and also firm size and industry effects. Firm size effects were weak while industry effects were much clearer and more consistent.

These higher CO2 concentrations will certainly affect growth but may also affect nutrient responses of crop plants. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the effect of elevated CO2 on the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition of two different crop species: wheat and cotton. Once establishing the new nutrient requirements of these crop species at elevated CO2 the study focussed on the interactive effects of elevated CO2 and N supply on growth and leaf N concentrations in cotton and wheat, carbohydrate metabolism, source:sink interactions and photosynthetic enzyme levels in the two species. Having established these effects, the role of N supply in controlling source:sink effects on Rubisco concentration were studied at the molecular level in wheat. Finally, some implications of the effect of elevated CO2 on wheat were examined, specifically on the quality of flour produced from wheat grain grown at elevated CO2. The foliar nitrogen concentrations, required to produce maximum shoot growth (critical concentrations) were lower at elevated CO2 while the critical phosphorus concentrations were higher.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crop species</field><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">cotton</field><field name="subject">nutrient</field><field name="subject">carbohydrate</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">photosynthetic</field><field name="subject">enzyme</field><field name="subject">Rubisco</field><field name="subject">foliar</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic variation and population structure within the Gudgeon genus Hypseleotris (Pisces-Eleotridae) in Southeastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Syaifullah</field><field name="description">This study investigated the causes of high level of intra-and inter-population variation known to occur in the morphology of fish in the genus Hypseleotris Eleotride in southern Australia, particularly within the Murray-Darling river system. The three major objectives of the study were, identify the number and distribution of species,determine the genetic structure of the populations and analyse relationships between species and consider the process of speciation in this species complex. The investigation of morphological variation in Hypseleotris confirmed the presence of two well known species i.e. H. compressa and H. galli, in the coastal rivers and also of the inland species H. klunzingeri. Populations of Hypseleotris klunzigeri sensu lato in inland river were found to be very highly variable and analysis using discriminant functions and principle component analysis showed the widespread presence of three forms (A, B1 and B2). The analysis was confused by the presence of north/south clines and upstream/downstream variation in characteristic in each form. After these factors were removed, there was still a great deal of variation in each population. The presence of hybrids between each pair of inland species, identified by both morphological and genetic data, further confused the analysis and makes identification of all specimens to species in the field difficult. Examination of type material of H. Klunzingeri showed that this belonged to form B2. The other forms can be related to the undescribed species, Midgley's carp gudgeon and Lake's carp gudgeon. Keys to the species in the complex in southeastern Australia are given. The morphological and genetic data show that H. compressa and H. klunzingeri are sister species, primarily separated by the eastern uplands. Similarly, the coastal species, H. galli is related to form B1 and more distantly, to form A. Possible scenarios for the complex are given.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fish species</field><field name="subject">Murray-Darling River</field><field name="subject">gudgeon</field><field name="subject">genetic data</field><field name="subject">coastal species</field><field name="subject">freshwater fish</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geochemical studies of selected base metal minerals from the supergene zone</field><field name="creator">Crane, Martin John</field><field name="description">Acid leaching of different natural chrysocolla samples under ambient conditions demonstrated that the chemical and chrystallographic inhomogenity significantly affects the rate and that it is virtually impossible to use the mineral as a model for the kinetics of hydrometallurgical processing of copper ores.Dissolution experiments, stability diagrams,and X-ray powder diffraction studies are undertaken and studied in this research and results are given.It is found that a complete solid solution series exists in Nature with most tungstenian wulfenites and molybdenum stolzites containing a range of compositions.

This would appear to be the antithesis of the claim of certain contemporary schools of epistemological thought, that a &#8216;theory&#8217; is a construction of the human mind. Yet Goethe&#8217;s scientific aims are resonant with a present day ecological need: to find a form of &#8216;nature study&#8217; which springs from a desire to care for things rather than merely to explain them, which can help to create a harmony between human and non-human nature. Goethe&#8217;s approach is phenomenological in that it seeks to uncover things &#8216;on their own terms&#8217;; it is integral in that it embraces both art and science. A Goethean methodology is used to study four Australian native plants: Grevillea buxifolia, Scaevola remosissima, Banksia integrifolia and Kunzea ambigua. It is suggested that Goethe&#8217;s way of &#8216;nature study&#8217; fulfils the contemporary need for a participatory knowing which is responsible for the thing being researched, and various possibilities are indicated for further research and application &#8211; in the biological sciences and in disciplines such as architecture, landscape design and environmental education.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">philosophy of ecology</field><field name="subject">plant ecology</field><field name="subject">spider flowers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation generation in buyer-seller relationships</field><field name="creator">Roy, Subroto</field><field name="description">In recent years, a number of researchers have questioned the traditional notion of the producer as the sole generator of innovation in buyer seller relationships. Increasingly, innovation generation has been recognized as an outcome of interaction between a firm and various outside entities. According to this view, supplier involvement and alliances are a route to innovation generation. Clearly, business market relationships provide an important opportunity for interaction between buyer and seller. Despite this realization, only very limited research has focused on innovation generation in business-to-business relationships. To alleviate this important gap in literature, this thesis develops a conceptual model and hypotheses of innovation generation in business-to-buyer seller relationships. The research uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques to examine the proposed theoretical model of innovation generation. A pilot case study is followed by development of and purification of measures using the IMP database on supplier customer interfirm relations in Europe and China. The hypotheses and model are tested using correlation and regression analysis. Results suggest that innovation generation is indeed facilitated by buyer seller interactions.

Empowerment results from the encouragement of the trainee to develop his/her own eclectic approach to their counselling, and this is only possible if a range of elective training programs are made available. This thesis also contends that no one agency or trainer is in a position to provide such a range of counselling approaches, and trainees should be motivated to use the service of other agencies, as well as being involved in independent studies. This inquiry proposes that one of the most effective foundations for the development of effective counsellors is the active encouragement of the trainee's self-awareness and the exploration of the trainee's inner life. If the success or failure of counselling depend on the ability of the counsellor to create an environment in which the client can explore his/her own issues, then it requires counsellors who have been empowered to make this discovery for themselves. This thesis also shows the author's own transformational journey, from a directed learner to a self-directed learner, and this paradigm shift in his own life has become the motivating force for empowering others to move into a position where they can exercise their own choices, and be empowered through participatory and transformative learning approaches.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-directed learner</field><field name="subject">trainee counsellors</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">self-awareness</field><field name="subject">clients</field><field name="subject">inner life</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and management of Eastern bearded dragon : Pogona barbata</field><field name="creator">Wotherspoon, Adrian D.</field><field name="description">There is a global effort to research the impacts of habitat fragmentation and degradation on wildlife. There is, however, still a need for greater understanding of ecological processes at work in fragmented and degraded habitat in peri-urban and agricultural areas. The study was undertaken in order to enable insights to be gained to provide a basis for management of fragmented habitat, using a single species as a focus. Eastern Bearded Dragon Pogona barbata is a reptile icon in Australia, but which is regarded anecdotally as being in decline, and for which little is known of the ecology. The aim of the study was to research the biology and spatial ecology of a species that had a dependent relationship on structural habitat of the nature of that found in peri-urban areas. Pogona barbata was selected as being an appropriate species in being terrestrial l /arboreal, having a territorial social structure, being an ecological generalist species, and being of a suitable size for study in relation to the size of fragmented habitat in western Sydney. Wild populations in relatively undisturbed habitat in the peri-urban area of western Sydney, Australia, were observed from 2000 to 2002, with additional data gained from museum collections and road-killed animals. Morphometrics were analysed by taking the ratio of a character to snout-vent length, and plotting that value against snout-vent length in order to more clearly see allometric change. Detailed tracking of animals using spool threads was used to collect data on microhabitat use, spatial activity and home range. The distribution of P. barbata across its range coincided with open forest and woodland habitat, which in some areas is subject to intensive urban and agricultural impacts. Pogona barbata is found to be insectivorous as a juvenile and omnivorous as an adult. As hatchlings grow, the relative length of the tail increases (positive allometry) until sexual maturity, and this coincides with an insectivorous diet. The onset of sexual maturity occurs just after the diet becomes omnivorous, and the relative tail length decreases (negative allometry) to a value that can be less than that of hatchlings. The gracile body form of juveniles is different from the robust body form of adults, and this is consistent with the difference in diet and microhabitat use. Factors affecting the persistence of the species were identified. Eggs were eaten by foxes on a regular basis, and hatchlings and juveniles were very rare, indicating an unbalanced demographic structure. The apparent rarity of hatchlings and juveniles may be due to crypsis. Road death was found to remove important breeding individuals from the population. An improved method of estimating testis volumes in lizards using three dimensions was used, which showed that the anatomy of P. barbata testes is bilaterally asymmetrical. It is currently assumed that reptile testes are at least bilaterally regular, but this is not the case in P. barbata. The outcome of this finding is that reproductive and other studies that rely on measurement of a single testis in two dimensions may miss significant data. Testis volumes for P. barbata in western Sydney in the past 20 years are highly abnormal, which coincides with increasing air pollution in the area. Extremes of testis condition were absent testes, very small testes, and extreme differences of testis size in individual animals. Resource partitioning was found, with microhabitat use, to be significantly different for juveniles, males and females. Juveniles and hatchlings used dense habitat with a high incidence of fine and coarse woody debris. The fine matter in the habitat upon which adult females also rely is lost in frequent fires that are used to control bushfire hazard. Pogona barbata is generally regarded as a sit-and-wait predator, on the basis of its being commonly observed on obvious perches. This study demonstrates that such perches are not the most important component of its habitat and that its foraging mode is that of a grazing omnivore. This study appears to be the first that addresses a seasonal shift in microhabitat use for a reptile in general terms. The pattern of daily activity changes with season, and changes in daily habitat preference based on age, sex and season, indicated that P. barbata required a diverse structural habitat. This habitat is affected by frequent hazard reduction fires. A new method of estimating animal home range is presented. The method consists of daily spool trace polygons collected by GPS and analysed in ArcView 3.2, with a spatial analysis output that indicates an estimated total home range and a confidence interval for that estimate. A typical result is an acceptable estimate within 20-30 sequential days of tracking an animal. That outcome is a considerable improvement on the currently accepted minimum of 50 independent days, being at least 100 calendar days. Pogona barbata &#8216;breaks the rules&#8217; for a number of concepts in the biology of reptiles, and in this study has displayed some new insights in testis morphology, ontology and ecology. It was rare in the areas studied, lending support to the perception that the species is in decline. Reproductive suppression was suspected to affect the population in western Sydney. Pogona barbata has shown a range of characteristics that makes it useful as an umbrella species for the purpose of managing fragmented and degraded habitat in peri-urban and agricultural areas. A range of biological and ecological measures is required to enable effective habitat management of any species, and this study has provided some appropriate techniques for that purpose.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bearded dragons</field><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model update system for modifications</field><field name="creator">Ding, Yulin</field><field name="description">Model checking is an existing approach for automatic reasoning. The model checker is an important tool and has been applied to software engineering for system verification. As an extension of model checking, model update is a new concept and has been defined and developed in this dissertation. A model updater is employed as an automatic system modification tool for software verification. The combination of model checking and model update completes the task of automatic system verification. In this dissertation, a comprehensive theoretical foundation and prototype implementation for CTL model update are developed. First, five primitive updates which capture the basic atomic operations in a CTL Kripke model are identified and formalized. Next, the minimal change criteria for CTL model update based on these primitive operations are defined. Then, updating an original model to a new model satisfying CTL semantics based on previous primitive updates and minimal change rules is characterized. The related complexity of CTL model update is also analyzed. Following this research, formal algorithms in the form of pseudo code to be used as the guidance for future implementation are designed. Then, a prototype CTL model updater is implemented. This prototype CTL model updater is a stand alone utility and contains both model checking and update functions. The prototype is then applied to three well known models and has successfully been tested. During the implementation, as a byproduct, the approach for extracting a complete Kripke model from NuSMV is described. Also, during the implementation, an up-date model explosion problem is discovered and further minimal change rules based on the original minimal change rules are proposed which significantly reduce the number of minimally updated models. The corresponding theory is formalized and the complexity for solving the update model explosion problem is analyzed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">configuration management</field><field name="subject">software maintenance</field><field name="subject">computer software</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenging understandings of racism through drama education praxis : steps to an ecology of culture</field><field name="creator">Weiss, Ben-Zion</field><field name="description">This research challenges understandings of racism through a drama based education praxis. The thesis structure is informed by the inquiry into the two part research question: How can critically reflecting on my praxis deepen my understanding of anti-racism processes in Australia? How can I document, evaluate and communicate my praxis? I situate the research in a qualitative methodology. I discuss the choice of narrative inquiry, arts-based inquiry and creative action research. I augment this with intuitive inquiry and explore lived experience research of hermeneutic phenomenology as applied to education and the social world and include first-person research. The creative action research is in three stages. The thesis is written in six chapters with a provocation, a prologue, an epilogue and appendices. The structure of the writing follows the stages of development of a drama-based experiential learning process. In the praxis chapters, I present theory and practice together, where the practice is presented as narratives that illuminate the theory. These stories of practice are usually followed by praxis discussions that are reflections on the practice in the light of the theory. Cultural conflicts such as racism can be transformed through drama education into intercultural communication and education.

This engineering of processes is based on technical advances, which enables organisations to enhance their communication and collaboration with their customer and each other. This research identifies how advanced technologies can be properly applied to create collaborative business processes of within and across organisations. This research has enabled this collaboration and extended its boundaries to facilitate dynamic collaborations amongst multiple organisations that may not necessarily be known to each other. The new model of collaboration achieves the recommended collaborative environment by restructuring the business processes for Web-based applications. This thesis also validates the proposed model for the collaboration in a global environment. This creation and validation of the model satisfies the requirements of a PhD-level research. The concept of Collaborative Business Process Engineering (CBPE) is unique in that it describes how cluster-based processes of multiple organisations can be engineered. Furthermore, this research also integrates the existing concepts of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and Business Process Management (BPM) in the model. CPBE is able to evaluate the impact of the interoperability of the organisations on their engineered business processes as well as their business structures. This research further demonstrates the implementation of CBPE in a proposed Collaborative Web-Based System (CWBS). This thesis discusses how the Web Services (WS) and mobile technologies, specifically Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI), influence the interoperation amongst multiple organisations. The impact of the WS on engineered business processes and the extension of this impact on multiple organisations and their clusters are included in this research. This thesis also describes the existing model of collaboration and provides a literature review to support the need for the proposed model of collaboration. Existing technologies for the engineering of the new collaborative business processes are explained. Detailed descriptions of the research methodologies (quantitative and qualitative), philosophies (interpretivist and constructivist) and theories (evolutionary and socio-technical) used are identified and described here. The dynamic aspects of collaboration in the proposed new model of collaboration, wherein organisations can enter and exit the collaboration at will are discussed. The thesis also discusses the factors influencing the collaboration, such as trust, security, confidence level and the availability of the channels for collaboration. The dynamic aspects of the proposed model are tested against the static aspects of the current model wherein the collaborating organisations need to set up prior contract before collaboration. A part of this study deals with evaluation of the significance of the CBPE for the organisations that adapt technologies such as Web Service and mobility. Finally, this thesis demonstrates an investigation in the impact of interoperability emanating from emerging technologies, specifically the Web Services technology, on organisations by providing a model as well as conceptual implementations. The proposed model of CBPE and the conceptual implementations facilitate the use of the emerging technologies for effective collaborations. These emerging technologies are presented and described in Chapter 2 while their impacts on the proposed model of CBPE are explained in Chapter 4. The proposed model in this thesis enables numerous businesses to collaborate electronically thereby producing dynamically collaborating groups/clusters. This thesis presents the modelling, understanding of collaborative business process that transcend the organisational boundaries, factors that influence collaborative business processes and the entry and exit criteria for these collaborative organisations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">technological innovations</field><field name="subject">reengineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing (researching) lived experience</field><field name="creator">Coxon, Ian</field><field name="description">After many years of research focusing on different aspects of human experience conducted both within design research and outside of it, no clear understanding of experience or ways it might be researched have yet been developed. Many conferences, academic papers, and design studies have described partial structures, formulas and hypotheses that have so far provided inadequate understandings of what constitutes experience and how it might be understood (especially in design){Engage, 2005 #263, p.68}. The first difficulty is that there are no suitable design research methods available to enable design researchers to study experience. Secondly, the nature of what is being studied (what constitutes experience) is unclear and thirdly (due to the absence of the first two) no well reasoned way has yet been found to make this type of information useful to designers. This research project set out to find a way to understand everyday human experience from the point of view of design, but first the tools and methods to do this kind of research had themselves to be researched. The personal experiences of a niche group of transport users were chosen as the research vehicle for an explorative research project. Using hermeneutical phenomenology to guide the philosophical orientation as well as many aspects of the methodological approach, field research was conducted in Australia and Europe. From this approach, taxonomy of the vehicle experience (ToE) was developed. A process of deeply (hermeneutically) exploring the information contained in this taxonomy produced a second set of methods (The SEEing process) that causes a deep understanding of the experience to emerge in the design researcher. Both these methods were successfully trialled in Australia and Germany and an analysis of the results is presented. The ToE-SEEing methodology described in this paper provides firstly, a structured approach to understanding a specific experiential situation. Secondly, the methods enable a fundamental and clear understanding of the deeper essences of the experience to be seen with a degree of clarity, such that informed design can take place. This methodology will be helpful to those for whom it is important to have a deep understanding of the experience they wish to design for, and it will be especially helpful for informing those responsible for decisions (design or otherwise) effecting the quality of others experience with goods or services. ToE-SEEing has been shown to be teachable, learnable and useful as a design methodology.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transportation</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">human factors</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intentional friendship : a philosophy of pastoral care</field><field name="creator">Oliphant, D. G.</field><field name="description">Pastoral care or its equivalent is part of the traditional means by which people within a community attempt to remain connected to each other positively and personally. Such personal community is modelled on the family; and the original pastoral carers are the parents of a well functioning family. In so far as God or the gods are then seen as standing in relation to the community as parents stand in relation to a family, so pastoral care has been founded in religion and theology. Its theoretical basis is centred in the attempt to think an adequate conception of God as a symbol of the community&#8217;s unity of will and purpose. Intentional Friendship: A Philosophy of Pastoral Care proposes such a theoretical base, centred in the attempt to think an adequate conception of the Self rather than God as a symbol of personal and cultural unity; such a conception must necessarily include the capacities for moral, aesthetic and intellectual judgments as distinctive of being a human person. The thesis proposes a conception of the Self as Agent as being adequate to a philosophy of pastoral care in a secular, multifaith society. Such a conception contains within it the conceptions of the Self as Subject and the Self as Object. Thinking then of the Self from the point of view of action enables the instituting of primary friendship as the central concept of personal community and pastoral care; a re-thinking of the relationship between religion, the arts and the sciences; the re-conception of religion as the processes governing interpersonal relationships, including the extension of those relationships out into idealized Others such as saints, gods and God; and the detailed analysis of the relationship between action and reflection as found ubiquitously in life and very specifically and consciously in Clinical Pastoral Education, the primary form of training in pastoral care in Australia. The adequacy of this theory or philosophy for multifaith pastoral care is tested in a pilot multifaith training group. In general terms the philosophy was found to contain and not conflict with the various traditions represented in the group. It was seen as an adequate basis to further explore multifaith chaplaincy and pastoral care within a society such as we have in Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pastoral care</field><field name="subject">pastoral theology</field><field name="subject">moral education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modified : cars, culture and event mechanics</field><field name="creator">Fuller, Glen R.</field><field name="description">This is an investigation of the enthusiasm, scenes and cultural industry of contemporary modified-car culture in Australia, based on fieldwork research with an online-based car club &#8211; where I participated as an enthusiast &#8211; and archival research of 30 years of enthusiast magazines and other texts. I develop a post-Kantian event-based conception of enthusiasm by drawing on the previous scholarship on modified-car culture read through post-structuralist theories of the &#8216;event&#8217; and &#8216;affect&#8217;. The oeuvre of Gilles Deleuze is a key theoretical influence on this work, which also draws on the historical method and philosophy of Michel Foucault, the practical social theory of Pierre Bourdieu, and develops Theodor Adorno&#8217;s work on the cultural industry by examining its biopolitical dimension. Enthusiasm is often thought of as a charismatic relation between the enthusiast subject and the enthusiast object modified cars. But here, enthusiasm is understood as the event of a multiplicity of affects that exists on transversal scales from the personal to the scene and beyond. I argue that the charismatic relation of enthusiasm is a reduction that enables the enthusiasm of a given scene to become a resource for cultural industries servicing that scene. The event of enthusiasm is defined by the affects that circulate across bodies and which are actualised in the capacities of enthusiasts, the objects engaged with, and practices performed. The scene is defined by the character of the cultural events which populate it and the enthusiasts who participate in the events. The cultural events include cruising, working on cars, racing, showing, and consuming or participating in the enthusiast media. I draw on my fieldwork to examine the affective composition of some of these events. Transformations to the cultural identity of scenes and enthusiasms correlate with broader social changes exemplified by the processes of globalisation. The event of enthusiasm is repeated in different ways that make connections between the scales of the subjectively experienced affects of cultural events to the global-level transformations of the automotive industry and scene. The cultural industries and social institutions enable the enthusiasm by investing in the infrastructure of the scene and facilitating the existence of cultural events through sponsorship or practical support. Archival research on enthusiast magazines allows me to map the transformations to the composition of power relations (dispositif) between the state (governmental regulatory bodies), social institutions (online and offline car clubs, and federations), enthusiast cultural industries (magazines, event promoters, and later importers) and different populations of enthusiasts (from interested public to highly skilled and devoted enthusiasts). The periods roughly delineated include the militancy of street rodding era (the 1970s), the spectacle of street machining era (1980s through to the present), and the immanent online-sociality of the import era (mid-1990s through to the present). The power relations of the three eras of contemporary modified-car culture in Australia are contrasted and I argue that the current dominant set of relations involve spectacular cultural events. In the context of 1980s street machining, I examine the way elite level vehicles built by highly skilled enthusiasts following spectacular head turning styles of modification are used by event promoters and magazines to collectively individuate a population of the interested public. The &#8216;head turner&#8217; is a singularity that organises the social spaces of the street and car shows and the discursive space of magazines. I argue that the emergent synergistic relation between magazines and event promoters is organised around the capacity of &#8216;head turners&#8217; to mediate relations between different populations of enthusiasts so that enthusiasm is reduced to a charismatic relation and cultural events become spectacular.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">automobiles</field><field name="subject">customizing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">enthusiasm</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aftershock : a cultural analysis of the Canberra Hospital implosion.</field><field name="creator">Blom, Kaaren Rhona</field><field name="description">The death of a child spectator at the implosion of the Royal Canberra Hospital on 13 July 1997 was an accident that had a profound impact on the local community, prompting a significant cursive response. Promoted as a public spectacle, the implosion was planned as an orchestrated collision between past and future that would enable an instantaneous obliteration of past in order to create a site of future opportunities. When it resulted instead in a failed demolition and the death of a child, the reversal of popular expectation precipitated not only shock, grief and guilt, but also a widespread state of ontological instability. If a certain fascination with death and disaster had contributed to the event&#8217;s popular appeal before the implosion, it was compounded by feelings of guilt and shame in the event&#8217;s tragic aftermath. Those feelings, shared by public and journalists alike, were given expression in the mediated discursive space of the Canberra Times and other media outlets, resulting in an extensive rhetorical performance of witness, therapy and argument. In this thesis, I use the diversity of voices that are held together in the discursive web that forms the textual fabric of this study&#8217;s empirical data, not to create a historical, single perspective narrative, but to go some way in re-creating the event, and the immediate response to it, by allowing that discourse to be re-voiced. As the product of extensive cultural labour on the parts of those who produced it, the implosion discourse, of which this thesis is now a part, stands as a significant corpus of commemorative work. This discourse is evidence of an engaged polity &#8211; one that transcended the passive role prescribed for it of an audience as consumers of entertainment to become, through its own labour, agents, creators and performers of meaning. My central thesis is that it is in this cultural performance that the true practice of &#8216;community&#8217; can be discerned.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disasters</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Royal Canberra Hospital implosion</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">implosion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art therapy and the patient experiencing psychosis who identifies as an artist : an exploratory study</field><field name="creator">Dash, Clare Sophia</field><field name="description">This thesis explores art therapy with patients experiencing psychosis who also identify as &#8216;artists&#8217;, and arose from encounters in a psychiatric setting. It is argued that these patients struggle with art therapy in a way that is different from other non-artist patients and they may appear to have difficulties relating to the emergence of emotional aspects in their own or others&#8217; artwork. This poses a potential problem for the art therapist who hopes to evoke insight for the patient, based on their artwork as self-expression. This dilemma and the countertransference phenomena specific to this problem are, with one exception, unacknowledged in art therapy literature. This thesis reviews art therapy literature to explore possible defence mechanisms as used by patients experiencing psychosis who identify as artists in art therapy. Four case studies of artist patients who undertook art therapy with the author are then presented. The psychological issues contributing to the artists&#8217; experience and the issues facing the art therapist are investigated. This is complemented by comments made by other art therapists from a questionnaire based on this area of enquiry. Finally the thesis addresses the topic with reference to art therapy practice providing strategies to work with patients experiencing psychosis who also identify as artists. The case studies revealed that patients were more receptive to using art to express emotions when art therapy was experienced as containing and the research found that art therapy was generally supportive for artists when their defences were viewed as appropriate coping strategies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art therapy</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis and art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian diplomacy towards Indonesia 1965-1972 : an examination from the Australian archival record</field><field name="creator">Najjarine, Karim</field><field name="description">Australia&#8217;s relationship with Indonesia has been a topic in diplomatic, academic, defence and intelligence circles in Australia for over fifty years. Australian diplomacy towards Indonesia in the period from the attempted coup in October 1965 until the fall of the Liberal &#8211; Country Party coalition in 1972, remains relatively overlooked by Australian researchers. There is virtually no research of this period drawn from Australian archival sources. This thesis seeks to rectify this gap in our knowledge. The study suggests that Australian diplomacy towards Indonesia from 1965 to 1972 was dominated by a fear which contradicted Australian intelligence and defence assessments of Indonesia&#8217;s threat potential to Australia. This study will examine how this fear contributed to, and was also reinforced by, a lack of a clear working definition of what constituted &#8216;security&#8217; in an Australian context. It bred a sense of insecurity and vulnerability by which Australian policy makers departed from a course of rationality. This is reflected in Australian relations with the New Order Government which were dominated by strategic concerns. Although Australia desired an informal closeness to the New Order Government, Jakarta&#8217;s increasing repression exposed Australia to international and domestic opprobrium with regard to the more salient abuses of the New Order Government.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">Australia-Indonesia foreign relations</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Awakening of the serpent energy : an Indian-Aboriginal performance exchange</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Beena</field><field name="description">This is a story of a cross-cultural dance exchange conceptualising myth as a living art through traditional Kathak dance form in collaboration with contemporary Aboriginal dance form, weaving and celebrating the reconciliation and independence of all people through male and female energy to evoke an ancient universal serpent energy.

The analysis is largely based on life history interviews with teenage girls with a medical diagnosis of anorexia. Other data sources include interview field-notes, my research journal and selected popular magazines. The data was analysed using a discourse analytic methodology to explore how girls constituted hospitalisation, anorexia, doctors and patients, among other issues. The analysis draws on insights from poststructuralist theory. In the earlier chapters, an analysis of the complex medical, psychological and feminist theories of anorexia nervosa; and a description of the hospitals where girls are treated is developed to situate the study in its socio-historical context. The analysis consists of three main arguments. The first is that clinical notions of food, eating and embodiment are in direct contrast to social discourses on these topics. Girls draw on this discrepancy in their resistance to hospital practices. The second argument is that girls are aware they are positioned as irrational because of their malnourished state and are also aware that if they blatantly resist treatment they will be subjected to further surveillance. Girls take up medical discourses in different ways and to different effects in constituting themselves as agenetic subjects. The third argument focuses on the shifting construction of the anorexia subject in the clinic. Although discourses of anorexia and psychiatry have a powerful impact on the girls; girls resist these positionings, finding other ways to constitute themselves. The contention of this thesis is that clinical constructions of anorexia work to form the subject and provide the possibilities for the creation of other subjectivities. On the basis of this research, some suggestions for how inpatient treatment regimes may work differently are provided.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anorexia nervosa</field><field name="subject">girls</field><field name="subject">eating disorders</field><field name="subject">feminist theories</field><field name="subject">psychological theories</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Background factors affecting success in geometry</field><field name="creator">Brodie, John Hector</field><field name="description">Mathematics plays a key role in bolstering a country&#8217;s knowledge economy. Australia&#8217;s knowledge economy is negatively affected by the underachievement of Australian school students in geometry. Research indicates a continuing decline in student performance in geometry and a distinct lack of geometrical knowledge and understanding on the part of students and teachers. To address this issue a theory of success in geometry that focussed on background variables and attitude, was developed. In the theory it was hypothesised that success in geometry can be understood in terms of predictor variables and that attitude mediates the effects of the variables on success in geometry. A model of success in geometry was developed to systematically determine the relationships of the variables. Trainee teachers from the University of Western Sydney (n = 224) participated in the survey. Using Confirmatory Factor Analysis the use of one or two attitude scales was determined as were the items in the scales. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) the relationships between the background factors (age, education, gender, left/right brain preference) on success in geometry (van Hiele level) mediated by attitude were determined. The evidence, however, suggests that attitude is not only correlated with the measures of success in geometry (van Hiele levels) but that it may also be a predictor of success in geometry. It was also hypothesised that attitude was composed of three analytically distinct factors (affective, cognitive and behavioural). The evidence suggests that this hypothesis cannot be rejected. This is an important finding as previous research has not been empirically able to distinguish these factors. In order to improve the success of Australian school students in geometry and assist teachers to succeed and consequently improve Australia&#8217;s knowledge economy, the present research indicates that: all trainee teachers should have their van Hiele level of geometry understanding determined; appropriate geometry courses should be a mandatory part of the curriculum for all pre-service teachers whose van Hiele level is less than three; all trainee teachers should have a van Hiele level of three or four before they commence teaching; appropriate changes to the curriculum of trainee teachers should be made so that their stored general evaluative process produces a positive attitude to geometry, especially in female students; school students who intend to pursue a teaching career should complete mathematics courses with a geometry content.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student performance</field><field name="subject">geometrical knowledge</field><field name="subject">geometry</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between the long grass and the housed : a qualitative inquiry into the experience of homelessness in Darwin</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Catherine Ann</field><field name="description">Shifting away from the traditional focus of enumeration and prevention of, or early exit from, homelessness, the present study was directed towards understanding the homeless experience and how the health and life quality of homeless people could be improved during their homelessness. To answer key questions, a mixed method inquiry explored the lived experience of homelessness in Darwin between June, 2004, and June, 2005. The study was undertaken through St. Vincent de Paul&#8217;s Ozanam House meal and shelter service. Their clients&#8217; life worlds and experiences were documented through participant observation, informal interviews and individual narratives. This study has found that there were very few treatment options available to homeless people who suffered from trauma related illnesses. Self management of wellbeing and health reinforced the negative perception of homeless people held by mainstream society, in turn reinforcing the stigmatising processes individuals spent much of their daily life managing. By addressing the key dimensions of the homeless experience which have had the greatest influence on health, the relevant agencies can begin to create living environments which reflect the experiences and the hopes of the homeless people and which are supportive of good health and a better quality of life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homelessness</field><field name="subject">Darwin</field><field name="subject">meal and shelter service</field><field name="subject">shelters for the homeless</field><field name="subject">homeless persons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond their reflection : an examination of self-concept, body images and experiences of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa</field><field name="creator">Ha, My Trinh</field><field name="description">Anorexia nervosa is recognised as a complex and chronic disorder that is often associated with poor prognosis and severe psychological and physiological consequences. Previous research has identified an array of factors associated with anorexia nervosa of which self-esteem, self-concept and body image are amongst the most commonly cited factors involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder. Capitalising on recent advances that have been made in other realms of psychology, the current study attempts to address current limitations regarding self-esteem, self-concept, body image and experiences of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa. More specifically, a series of three studies were designed to address : a/ self-esteem and self-concept ; b/ body image and the association between body image and self-concept; and c/ the experiences and support needs of young people with eating disorders.The current findings have demonstrated that whilst quantitative methods can be effectively utilised to elucidate various relations between predictor and outcome variables, qualitative methods can offer important insight into the patient with the eating disorder On a more general level, the current results obtained from the current series of studies may be able to inform current conceptualisations of anorexia nervosa and the future development of aetiology and treatment programs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anorexia nervosa</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">eating disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Care giving experiences of older husbands providing care for wives with dementia</field><field name="creator">Brown, Peter John</field><field name="description">As there were few studies of older husbands&#8217; experiences associated with providing care at home for spouses with dementia, the researcher designed a two-stage study to examine their experiences, In stage one, a qualitative paradigm guided one-to-one interviews with sixteen care giver husbands to examine their care giving experiences. Analysis of the interview data guided the identification of four models of care giving related to the past, present and future and an overall model over time. In stage two, a comprehensive questionnaire was developed and questionnaire items were identified from multiple sources. In stage two the researcher utilized a quantitative approach to identify to investigate husbands&#8217; experiences. A representative sample of 71 care giver husbands participated by completing the questionnaire and standardized measures of burden and depression along with other measures of husbands&#8217; characteristics and experiences and levels of wives&#8217; illness and associated behaviour. Predictive models of care giver burden were care giving seen as a &#8216;job&#8217;, effects of care giving on the husband-wife relationship, and use of avoidant-evasive coping strategies by husbands. The best predictive models of care giver depression were use of avoidant-evasive coping strategies and changes in husbands&#8217; emotional health status related to care giving.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">male caregivers</field><field name="subject">dementia patients</field><field name="subject">long term care</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">family relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular immune responses of marsupials : family Macropodidae</field><field name="creator">Young, Lauren Jill</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a comprehensive study of the cellular responses of a number of endangered marsupial species with a principal focus on the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) as a model macropod species. The development of in vitro experimental assays for the assessment of immune responses in this model species are described, which provided a set of benchmarks for comparisons with other members of the Macropodidae and with eutherian mammals. Once this data was collected and protocols were established, the study was extended to include investigations of the immune responses in opportunistic samples obtained from the Rufous Hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus), the Long-footed potoroo ( Potorous longipes) and the more common, but nonetheless still vulnerable, Long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) with a view to investigating their apparent susceptibility to infection with intracellular pathogens, particularly mycobacterial species. The findings from the application of these assays suggest that the cellular immune responses of these species are relatively complex and involve a level of sophistication that rivals their eutherian counterparts. Specifically peripheral blood and tissue leukocytes were morphologically similar to those of other mammals, with the exception of tammar wallaby monocytes that appeared to contain few lysosomal granules, and the basophils of the Rufous Hare-wallaby that contained very large atypical granules. The overall findings of this study suggest that the immune systems of macropod species possess most of the sophistication associated with that of eutherian mammals. Whilst some differences were apparent in cells and their products in the test species, no single factor common to all macropods was identified as a cause for immune dysfunction. It appears likely that as yet undefined factors related to their confinement rather than an inherent defect in their immunocapacity is responsible for the apparent disease susceptibility of these animals.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macropods</field><field name="subject">eutherian mammals</field><field name="subject">Rufous Hare-wallaby</field><field name="subject">Tammar wallaby</field><field name="subject">marsupial</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating a singing voice in diverse genres and styles : a discussion of context and process</field><field name="creator">Kanaridis, Mina</field><field name="description">The author investigates the voice in diverse genres and styles, documenting and interpreting vocal performance through a contextual analysis of specifically chosen repertoire.

How do post-feminist discursive constructions of woman regulate women&#8217;s subjectivity and define the field of possible actions and shape desire? What does post-feminist discourse make possible and consequently what does it exclude from the realm of possible actions and articulations? These questions are explored empirically through two studies: first, a discourse analysis of post-feminist discourses in popular media and, second, a discourse analysis of in-depth interviews with women on their experiences and views of &#8216;femininity&#8217; and gender-power relations. From the analysis of Study 1, I argue that &#8216;post-feminism&#8217; produces a feminine subject who understands herself to be &#8216;emancipated&#8217;, to have the same opportunities as men and the same &#8216;choices&#8217; whilst simultaneously reproducing dominant patriarchal versions of femininity which continue to regulate and constrain women&#8217;s desire In Study 2, analysis of the interview texts illustrates some of the ways that feminine subjectivity continues to be regulated by patriarchal fantasies and ideals of &#8216;woman&#8217;. It was found that the regulative power of masculine fantasies of woman as &#8216;home&#8217; and as &#8216;ideal mother&#8217; constrain the interviewee&#8217;s experiences, choices and desires despite the post-feminist insistence that woman is no longer bound by anachronistic expectations or outmoded stereotypes. Overall, it is proposed that a post-feminist &#8216;regime of truth&#8217; profoundly impacts on our ability to critically engage with issues of power as they relate to gender inequality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">desire</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compulsion and recovery (C and R) research</field><field name="creator">Adagio, Affie</field><field name="description">When I began the Compulsion and Recovery Research Project in 1992, I did so in response to the schism between professionals who were leaders in the addiction recovery field. Known as the D and A Debate, this schism resulted in changes in government policy, funding and service provision, causing great confusion to people suffering with addictions. It was described by the media as 'addiction treatment now a battleground'.As a family therapist specialising in addictions recovery, I became concerned about this battle between leaders in the recovery field and its impact on the community. I had experience in running halfway houses for people recovering from addictions and knew that abstinence with AA worked. I embarked on a research project which used a dialectic/narrative method inquiry method, interviewing leaders in the conflict and others who contributed progressive ideas to recovery. This process aimed at ensuring there was validity, rigour and ethics in the research process. Importantly as a result of this inquiry, I came to believe that the Drug and Alcohol Debate (D and A Debate) protagonists need not dogmatically defend their own model to the point of being in conflict, as all their treatments work, and it was valid to concede that different models work for different people in different stages of their recovery - 'whatever works works, and not to be judged by others'.

In this thesis, we investigate the problems of authorization in distributed environments and security protocol verification and update. Authorization decisions are required in large-scale distributed environments, such as electronic commerce, remote resource sharing, etc. We adopt the trust management approach, in which authorization is viewed as a &#8216;proof of compliance" problem. We develop an authorization language AL with non-monotonic feature as the policy and credential specification language, which can express delegation with depth control, complex subject structures, both positive and negative authorizations, and separation of duty concepts. The theoretical foundation for language AL is the answer set semantics of logic programming. We transform AL to logic programs and the authorization decisions are based on answer sets of the programs. We also explore the tractable subclasses of language AL. We implement a fine grained access control prototype system for XML resources, in which the language AL&#164; simplified from AL is the policy and credential specification language. We define XPolicy, the XML format of AL&#164;, which is a DTD for the XML policy documents. The semantics of the policy is based on the semantics of language AL. The system is implemented using Java programming. We investigate the security protocol verification problem in provable security approach. Based on logic programming with answer set semantics, we develop a unified framework for security protocol verification and update, which integrates protocol specification, verification and update. The update model is defined using forgetting techniques in logic programming. Through a case study protocol, we demonstrate an application of our approach.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer security</field><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">database security</field><field name="subject">logic programming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing and developing Aboriginal service organisations : a journey of consciousness</field><field name="creator">Knox, Kelvin John</field><field name="description">Aboriginal young people are exposed to the impact of colonisation in Australia. They are at risk of becoming alienated from their homelands, cultures, communities and families. Some have become alienated, joining one of the most marginalised groups in Australian society &#8211; homeless people. Aboriginal young people, many of whom are already marginalised because of their indigeneity, join a group that can be described as further marginalised &#8211; that is, Aboriginal and homeless. In essence, Aboriginal homelessness can be seen and described as a loss of sovereignty. The Hebersham Aboriginal Youth Service (HAYS) is an organisation that is responding to the phenomenon of Aboriginal youth homelessness. HAYS is funded and operates under a joint Australian Federal, State and Territory government programmatic response that assists people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. This thesis reviews the design and development of HAYS as an Aboriginal service organisation. The central thesis research question is: How should a service for homeless Aboriginal youth be designed and developed? In addressing this question, a case study methodology is utilised which is capable of facilitating research in contemporary organisational settings, such as in HAYS where its design participants operate around specific visions and goals. The research findings indicate that HAYS should become a &#8216;modern-day tribal ground&#8217; in the form of the Mount Druitt Aboriginal Homeland Centre (MDAHC). In order to progress this model, a substantive theory of coherent dialogue is presented containing five critical design and development propositions educed from the research. The theory contains lessons for the design and development of urban Aboriginal community service organisations.  This thesis concludes with a plea for consciousness-raising between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people involved in the design and development of Aboriginal community service organisations &#8211; a move towards the development of a critical consciousness for a better world through coherent dialogue.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal young people</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal homelessness</field><field name="subject">Hebersham Aboriginal Youth Service (HAYS)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a theoretically-based, psychometrically sound, multidimensional measure of student motivation for use in diverse cultural settings</field><field name="creator">Ali, Jinnat</field><field name="description">Critics of currently available school motivation research consistently identify shortcomings such as the lack of a theoretical basis for defining and interpreting the construct and the poor quality of instruments used to measure it. There is a dearth of reliable, valid, theoretically informed, and cross-culturally comparable standardised measures of motivation. Whilst a number of theorists have proposed that motivation may be a multidimensional construct and may also be hierarchical in nature, partly due to the lack of available multidimensional measurement instruments, there has been limited research testing such theoretical propositions. The present investigation comprised two inter-related study components. The purposes of Study 1 were to (1) develop a valid and reliable multidimensional measure of school motivation based on Maehr&#8217;s Personal Investment Theory that was robust in diverse cultural settings; and (2) test the multidimensional and hierarchical structure of school motivation to elucidate the nature and structure of student motivation cross-culturally and further extend motivational theory and research. The purpose of Study 2 was to (1) test the relation of multidimensional components of student motivation and academic achievement in cross-cultural contexts, to further elucidate the relations amongst these constructs; and (2) to identify similarities and differences in motivational profiles for different cultural groups in order to support the validity and usefulness of the multidimensional motivation instrument in educational settings. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the psychometric properties of the measures, and reliability tests were conducted to establish the internal consistency for each scale. Factorial invariance analysis was conducted to examine the equivalence of the data structure across cultural groups, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was conducted to examine the structural relations between eight ISM motivation factors and four outcome measures (Math, English, GPA, School attendance). Multivariate analysis of variances was conducted to examine statistical difference among the seven cultural groups in relation to eight ISM scales.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">motivation in education</field><field name="subject">evaluation in education</field><field name="subject">student motivation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and applications of moving least square Ritz method in science and engineering computation</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Li</field><field name="description">A detailed literature review on the development and applications of several numerical methods in solid mechanics and electromagnetic field analysis is presented in the thesis. Despite the great achievements in this research area, there are always the needs to develop new numerical methods or to explore alternative techniques for the purpose of solving the complicate problems and improve the efficiency and accuracy of the existing or new numerical methods. This thesis presents the development of a novel numerical method, the moving least square Ritz (MLS-Ritz) method, and its applications for solving science and engineering problems. The MLS-Ritz method is based on the moving least square (MLS) data interpolation technique and the Ritz minimization principle. The MLS technique is utilized to establish the Ritz trial functions for two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) cases. A point substitution approach is developed to enforce boundary conditions. The proposed MLS-Ritz method has the ability to expand the applicability of the conventional Ritz method and meshless method for analysing problems with complex geometries and multiple mediums. The applications of the MLS-Ritz method are also extended to the analysis of the electromagnetic field problems. Three cases including electrical potential problems in a uniform trough and with dielectric medium and a waveguide eigenvalue problem are analysed and compared with solutions obtained by other methods. Comparison studies show that excellent agreement is achieved for the three cases when comparing with existing results in the open literature. The future directions in the development of the MLS-Ritz method for science and engineering computations are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">engineering mathematics</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">computer science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital fictions imaging landscape identity and ideology</field><field name="creator">George, Phillip</field><field name="description">The friction between fact and official fiction appears to be a critical factor in all our lives. Bearing artistic witness to contemporary geo political life necessitates the utilisation of the technologies that are deployed at us, as a mirror to deflect and reflect upon the ideologically mediated strikes carried out against us. I have digitally manipulated documentary photography at the microscopic level and reworked the evidence in a manner that remains undetectable. The documentary information digitised the matrices of data as if at a genetic level, causing simulation of the real. This manipulation of the photographic document is seen to critique our contemporary condition where official fictions can now be represented as historic fact. This work challenges the integrity of vision and the nature of evidence by producing fictional documentation at a high resolution, which gives the illusion and authority of a photographic non-fictional representation. From within my studio-based research, what is and will be possible, how a history is recorded and represented, has been interrogated, by using one form of evidence &#8212; in this case, the photograph. Artistic works developed throughout the DCA examined the way a visual history is recorded and in this case, photographically represented. Appreciating the ideology of territory was seen as critical, particularly within an international agenda. Territory was established as a site for research. A territorial containment methodology was established. The territorial containment methodology was to simply designate a physical territory and then produce works from within this designated space. The containment methodology started with 18th century Botany Bay moved around to the next bay Little Bay and forward in time to 1969 and the contemporary artists the Christo&#8217;s wrapping of the space. Employing the same methodology the research moved into the Australian Western desert then off island to the Middle East. The collective outcomes of the research are represented by solo and group exhibitions and related publications, all of which are recorded within this document.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">documentary photography</field><field name="subject">photography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and speciation of heavy metals in sediments from Lake Burragorang</field><field name="creator">Painuly, Archana Saily</field><field name="description">Lake Burragorang, the focus of this thesis, is the main water supply source for the large population of Sydney and is a major source for the Blue Mountains residents.

This seems partly due to the difficulties inherent in studying this low-incidence disability and partly to conflicting views of early language development and the role of maternal input. The defined focus area of my research, reviewed in the overarching statement in this portfolio, is the investigation of early interaction and how blindness affects maternal input, emotional availability, and children&#8217;s early word use. The broader context of my work is early language development for all children. At the centre of my studies are four mother-child dyads who were studied from the time the children were 18-19 months old and just beginning to use words, and then followed through until around the time of the children&#8217;s second birthday. The studies show that these mothers were no more directive than mothers whose children were sighted, but that they made few adaptations to their children&#8217;s particular needs for frequent and relevant information about the world around them. This portfolio provides an overarching statement of issues and research findings from studies of maternal interaction with young children who are blind, within the context of issues in early language development and early intervention. To represent the scope of my work, the examples of my refereed publications include those that are research-based as well as those that are more generally related to professional practice. This more general writing for teachers and caregivers provides an essential link between theory and practice. The studies of children with blindness inform, and have been informed by, current understanding of what is significant in early development for all children. Thus the significance of the work presented lies not only in the contribution to the research literature, but also in the potential for informing intervention practice and timely support for families.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blind children</field><field name="subject">children with disabilities</field><field name="subject">visual disabilities in children</field><field name="subject">language awareness in children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of a nurse led supportive educative learning program for family caregivers (SELF) on outcomes for stroke survivors and the family carers in Thailand.</field><field name="creator">Oupra, R.</field><field name="description">Complications due to stroke account for a significant proportion of admissions to medical wards in Thailand. Unlike western countries where community rehabilitation programs have been established to provide services following the acute stage of stroke recovery, there is no stroke rehabilitation team in the community and family care givers are the primary source of ongoing care and support. This research was a comparative study with concurrent controls, using a two-group pre-test and post test design. The aims of this study were to develop and implement a nurse led supportive educative learning program for care givers of stroke survivors, and to evaluate outcomes for patients and their carers. The study demonstrated that providing education and support to the family caregiver of stroke survivors does benefit both the survivors and caregiver by empower carers to make decisions about the care they provide which has a follow on effect of reducing care stress and burden. It is recommended that programs to provide carers with skills and knowledge to assume an active and therapeutic role in the management of family members who suffer a stroke be established and appropriately supported. Furthermore, implementing this research in other regions of Thailand is recommended.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="subject">home care</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">strokes</field><field name="subject">patient rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of an nC24 agricultural mineral oil on tritrophic interactions between French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), two-spotted mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) and its predator, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot.</field><field name="creator">Xue, Yingen</field><field name="description">A comprehensive evaluation of the effects of an nC24 agricultural mineral oil (AMO) on tritrophic interactions between French bean Phaseolus vulgaris cv.

Inappropriate land use practices (intensity, duration and timing of grazing), total grazing pressure, poor knowledge of ecosystem fragility and seasonal variation are some of the issues that contribute to an actual or perceived degradation of the landscape. Many of the current practices are seemingly at odds with the attitudes and values of the wider community and also those of the pastoralists who carry out these practices. This thesis seeks to explain this apparent contradiction. The thesis is composed of four elements. The first element reviews historical (mostly European) thinking about nature and the relationship between nature and society and traces how this thinking has changed through time. The second element is a review of the history of land settlement and land use in the division, and shows how the development of the division followed contemporary societal attitudes and values. The third element is an examination of the portrayal of landscape in a western visual art tradition and how this has the potential to be used to reflect contemporary social attitudes and values. The fourth element involves the use of three projects that used art and text as a basis for investigating the attitudes and values of people in the Western Division. The findings of the research indicate that visual landscape has the potential to become an aid in the identification of community attitudes and values about the landscape in which they live. Further, this technique allows for the emergence of other factors such as individual identity and its accommodation within the behavioural framework. In accommodating such factors as individual identity, individual and social attitudes and values toward the environment in any discussion of behaviour in relation to the landscape and its use, a better understanding of the motives underlying behaviour will be gained. In so doing better decisions can be made by both pastoralists and land administrators. Further research is needed to verify the usefulness of these findings in both opening up a positive dialogue with landholders and administrators and in aligning pastoralists&#8217; behaviour towards a more sustainable land use ethic.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">landscape in art</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Force of habit : the construction and negotiation of subjectivity in Catholic nuns</field><field name="creator">Brock, Megan P.</field><field name="description">While a woman&#8217;s identity is constructed on multiple sites, it is the Catholic Church which constructs, regulates and ascribes meaning to the life of the Catholic Nun. In this thesis, which adopts a Foucauldian and feminist approach, an examination of six important Church texts relating to Nuns&#8223; lives identifies three dominant discursive constructions of Nun, namely the Nun as called by God, to sacrifice her life, and to work for the Church in its mission. Individual and focus group interview data from a sample of 43 Nuns in Australia and New Zealand is examined for ways in which Nuns negotiate such constructions in their experience of being Nuns. The Church&#8217;s discursive truths of what it is to be Nun, learnt during the process of subjectification of the Novitiate or training process, continue to be taken up by Nuns in this study. Functioning as the Institutional Self, they position themselves as docile Church women, loyal to the Church and its mission. However, they also resist the Church&#8217;s truths and material practices for their lives, functioning as the Individuated Self, a self refusing to be regulated by such truths and material practices laid down by the Church. Nuns in this study show evidence of adopting fluid positioning, functioning neither wholly as Institutional Self nor as Individuated Self, since they give accounts of both taking up and resisting the Church&#8217;s constructions of Nun. However, it is in the position of resistance that they contribute to the creation of new notions of what it is to be &#8216;Nun&#8217;, namely the Nun as an autonomous woman, exercising personal agency in her life, and working not necessarily for the Church, but for the poor and the marginalised in the world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nuns</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Edge effects on small skinks : their prey, predators and competitors in peri-urban remnants in north-western Sydney /</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Lynette P.</field><field name="description">This study focused on the interactions between small skinks and their major predators/competitors (birds) and prey (arthropods) in core and edge areas of small, long established remnant Cumberland Plain woodlands of Richmond, New South Wales, Australia. Eight study sites were selected (4 edge and 4 core) within the peri-urban environment to compare the abundance and diversity of small skinks, birds and arthropods. Of the three taxa, only arthropods maintained a similar abundance and diversity between edge and core areas. Birds and skinks were either in lower numbers in the perimeter areas (skinks), or were interior/perimeter specialists (birds). Arthropod diversity and abundance of preferred skink prey, was also examined. It was concluded that the distribution of arthropod prey was similar between core and edge areas, and therefore, was not considered to have an influence on small skinks&#8217; ability to inhabit edges. However, large, aggressive/noisy birds (including skink and small bird predators) dominated edge areas. Those birds encountered in the edge foraged in a variety of niches, such as on the ground or they swooped from vantage points. This, coupled with other anti competitor behaviour (e.g. noise, aggression, flocking), placed these birds in proximity to skinks in the edge areas. However, as most of these birds were also predators of skinks, it was concluded that the evidence supported a predator/prey relationship in the perimeter area, rather than a competitive one. This was supported by predation rates on skinks, using decoys. Birds preyed on small skink in greater numbers in the perimeter of woodland remnants than in their interior. This predation pressure was sustained throughout the year. It was concluded that predation and/or displacement of skinks and small birds resulted in lower numbers being observed in edge compared to core areas. This study demonstrated that old, small remnants not continually exposed to major disturbances (e.g. logging, agricultural practices) can re-establish stability in terms of environmental conditions. However, a stable environment or a single taxonomic group does not necessarily predict the response individual taxa will have to edge habitats and that this can alter the interactions between dependent groups such as prey/predator or competitors. .</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">effect of habitat modification on</field><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">predation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Love in the first degree : handbag dance music and gay male culture</field><field name="creator">Renzo, Adrian</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the links between handbag dance music and gay male culture. Handbag (colloquial British slang for &#8216;uplifting,&#8217; &#8216;girly&#8217; remixes of Top 40 songs and similar club material) is frequently derided within club culture for being predictable, formulaic, and &#8216;commercial.&#8217; However, the same music is hugely popular within gay male clubs. Significantly, handbag tends to retain clear song structures, as opposed to the more open-ended instrumental &#8216;tracks&#8217; which are the norm in electronic dance music. Why would a marginalised group adopt such a low-status music as its own? Why does handbag have such low status in the first place? This thesis argues that the field of &#8216;electronic dance music&#8217; is rife with distinctions between &#8216;credible&#8217; dance music and &#8216;commercial trash,&#8217; and that these distinctions are frequently used to downplay song-based genres. The pleasures of handbag can be better understood if we pay attention to the ways that &#8216;songs&#8217; (rather than instrumental &#8216;tracks&#8217;) have always played an important role in club music. Love in the First Degree questions an emerging orthodoxy in sociology and popular music studies: that issues of identity can only be approached ethnographically. By interrogating the music itself, the thesis explores the ways in which musical conventions can be deployed to arouse desire on the dance floor&#8212;and the reasons that these musical strategies are particularly useful in gay male clubs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homosexuality and music.</field><field name="subject">sex in music</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The right of labour to its produce : producerism and worker politics, 1775-1930</field><field name="creator">Cole, Harry</field><field name="description">Between 1775 and 1930 Anglo-American and Australian worker politics were centred on the belief that working people endured economic inequality through the unfair social division of wealth. Regardless of political affiliation, contemporary working-class radicals saw the solution to what was variously described as &#8216;the labour problem&#8217;, &#8216;the economic problem&#8217;, or &#8216;the social problem&#8217; as the return of most or all of a nation&#8217;s wealth from those who had accumulated it to those that had originally produced it&#8212;a perspective described by North American historians as producerism. Following sections on precursors in British and American sources, the study looks at producerism at two important junctures in the political and economic history of New South Wales: the 1840s, and the period 1890-1930. Both were times of severe or fluctuating economic conditions and political mobilisation. The first period witnessed a middle-class challenge for control of the state. It utilised a constitutional radicalism that enlisted the working classes through cautious use of producerist argument. These producerist references tended to be oblique and muted but nevertheless offer proof of its existence in the colony. The second was one of direct working-class challenge for state power, where producerism&#8217;s presence as the guiding force of worker politics was more obvious. Beginning in the depression of the 1890s it looks at how the radical literature associated with Australian socialism, syndicalism and labourism built cases for economic and social justice on producerist foundations. In this way it underlined worker politics until a precipitous post-1930 decline.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">England</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">social history</field><field name="subject">political history</field><field name="subject">working class</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation and spatial partitioning of mip-mappable geometry images</field><field name="creator">Domanski, Luke</field><field name="description">A Geometry Image (GIM) describes a regular polygonal surface mesh using a standard 2D image format without the need for explicit connectivity information. Like many regular or semi-regular surface representations, GIMs lend themselves well to a number processing tasks performed in computer graphics. It has been suggested that GIMs could provide improvements within real-time rendering pipelines through straightforward localised surface processing and simple mip-map based level-of-detail. The simplicity of such algorithms in the case of GIMs makes them highly amenable to user transparent implementation in graphics hardware or programming libraries, shifting implementation responsibility from the application programmer and reducing the processing load on the CPU. However, these topics have received limited attention in the literature. This thesis examines a number of issues regarding mip-mapping and localised processing of GIMs. In particular, it focuses on the creation of mip-mappable multi-chart GIMs and how to spatially partition and cull GIMs such that mip-mapping and localised processing can be performed effectively. These are important processing tasks that occur before rendering takes place, but influence how mip-mapping and localised processing can be implemented and utilised during rendering. Solutions to these tasks that consider such influences are, therefore, likely to facilitate simple and effective algorithms for mip-mapping and localised processing of GIMs that are amenable to hardware implementation. The topics discussed in this thesis will form a basis for future work on low level geometric mip-mapping and localised processing of GIMs in real-time graphics pipelines. With respect to creating mip-mappable GIMs, the thesis presents a method for automatic generation of polycube parameter domains and surface mappings that can be used to create multi-chart GIMs with square or rectangular charts. As will be discussed, these GIMs provide particular advantages for mip-mapping compared to multi-chart GIMs with irregular shaped charts. The method casts the polycube generation problem as a coarse topology preserving voxelisation of the surface that simultaneously aligns the surface with the voxel set boundary. This process produces both the polycube and an initial surface-to-polycube mapping. Theorems for piecewise construction of well-composed voxel sets are also presented that facilitate a piecewise implementation of the polycube generation algorithm and support the topological guarantees it provides. This method improves on previous methods for polycube generation which require significant user interaction. For spatial partitioning of GIMs the thesis introduces the concept of locality masks, bit masks partitioning parameter space. The method stores a 2D bit mask at each spatial node which identifies the set of GIM samples inside the node&#8217;s spatial range. Like GIMs the locality masks support mip-mapping through simple image down-sampling. By unifying the masks of all nodes that pass a spatial query processing can be performed globally on the unculled set of primitives rather than on a node-by-node basis, promoting a more optimised order in which to performed localised processing. Locality masks are also well suited to compression and provide a bandwidth efficient method of transferring a list of indexed rendering primitives. The locality masks method is compared to other methods of partitioning and culling GIMs in various ways and their suitability for rendering and other task is analysed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">geometry</field><field name="subject">computer vision</field><field name="subject">digital techniques</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the financing of Sri Lankan small businesses and their use of ethnic networks to support their business endeavours</field><field name="creator">Devarajan, Jeyaraman</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the sources for generating financial and social capital for ethnic small business owners, particularly for Sri Lankan ethnic small businesses in Australia.

We found that competition and rising costs are the major business problem for Sri Lankan ethnic small business owners, not raising capital. The reasons for using personal savings as the major surce of capital include difficulties associated with approaching financial institutions and government agencies. The role of networking with ethnic associations was also explored.

This study investigates the evolution of values over a lifetime, their nature, dynamic and role in women's identity formation in the family setting. How might the Women's Liberation Movement (WLM) have influenced the participants&#8217; new choices and gender relations, their conditioned beliefs about self-in-the-world and their conscious worldviews? A sample of twelve women born between 1937 and 1948 was interviewed in-depth about the values they grew up with, if and how their values changed during the time of the WLM, what they are valuing now in their midlife and what they see as important for their future. Three frameworks influenced this study. Ken Wilber's integral framework of All Quadrants All Levels (AQAL) provided insight into the spectrum of consciousness. Spiral Dynamics (SD) gave an interpretation of the communal dimension of how values cluster into historically defined worldviews. The Australian Values Inventory (AVI), a Personal Development Profile, was used in this study to analyse the current values of the participants. Coming from an eco-feminist perspective, I used a case study approach in conjunction with the standardised AVI instrument.

The odyssey that results is portrayed as one of epistemic learning in which the meaning of participation is central. The first part (Chapters 1-4) introduces the philosophical understandings gained at the end of the research in order to assist the reader&#8217;s orientation at the beginning of the thesis. This explanation depends upon understanding the paradigmatic implications of Classical and Quantum Physics along with an autooethnographic approach. Using these concepts, I portray my experiences in agricultural development with peasants in the Solomon Islands and Mozambique as na&#239;ve systemic practice. This practice arises in response to the continual failure of contemporary development which I refer to as expat-centric development. I systemically reframe the categories of &#8220;expert&#8221; and &#8220;blueprint project&#8221; which become &#8220;expert and project with peasant.&#8221; The development that results I find to be easy and successful, yet it is ignored and undermined. This leads me to a watershed experience, which becomes Part 2 (Chapter 5) of the thesis.Within Part 3 I see the role of society&#8217;s institutions to replicate the mechanistic paradigm. Thus, in order to avoid the institutional entrapment that results from this, I see the need post-thesis, to participate in evolving new social structures that can replicate the paradigm of systemic participation. This will largely depend upon the willingness of society to engage with a cosmology of connectedness.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peasants</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">peasantry</field><field name="subject">theory of knowledge</field><field name="subject">underprivileged people</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Erosion and water resources assessment in the Upper Inabanga Watershed, Philippines : application of WEPP and GIS tools.</field><field name="creator">Genson, Imelida C.</field><field name="description">To complement the Inabanga Watershed Project (BSWM, 2005), the study reported here was conducted to assess erosion and water resources degradation focussed on the Upper Inabanga Watershed using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) erosion model and geographic information system and GIS tools. The study was divided into two sections. The first section was the assessment of the impact of land uses and farm management practices using five runoff experimental plots and two watersheds. The second section of the study was an application of the WEPP and GeoWEPP erosion models. Except for most of the crop management parameters, local climate, soil and topographic parameters were determined and used as inputs to run the model. The WEPP-GeoWEPP watershed simulations predicted that any increase in agricultural areas increased on-site soil loss and sediment yield from the watershed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water resources development</field><field name="subject">Phillipines</field><field name="subject">farm management</field><field name="subject">soil erosion</field><field name="subject">farms;</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of restoration : a grassy woodland</field><field name="creator">Nichols, Peter William Broughton</field><field name="description">The aims of this project were to: 1. further develop the evaluation systems of Westman (1986), Chapman and Underwood (2000) and Wilkins et al (2004) proposed for the assessment of restored ecosystems; and 2. use these developments to evaluate whether the revegetation of agricultural land on the Cumberland Plain, west of Sydney, NSW, has led to the re-establishment of a grassy woodland. The evaluation system developed in this Thesis was designed to compare three key ecosystem attributes. First, to assess how restoration was progressing, the species richness, composition and vegetation structure of abandoned pasture (starting point), was compared to that of restored vegetation of differing ages (putative mid points), and remnants (goal or end point). Refinements of the previous assessment models included formulation of predictions about native and exotic species richness and composition under the assumption that restoration was succeeding, and explicit testing of these predictions by planned comparisons and trajectory analysis of species composition. Second, the small-scale effects of planted tree canopies on species composition were assessed to test the hypothesis that native tree canopies facilitate the return of natives. Third, the effects of fire and neighbour removal on seedling emergence and establishment in pasture, restored vegetation and remnants were examined to explore what factors controlled germination and establishment. The results of this study indicate that to date, there has been a partial success of the restoration program at the study sites: while native species have returned unaided to restored sites, the trajectory of native species composition was not in the direction of remnants. There was however, increased species richness of exotic species detected underneath planted tree canopies. Patterns of seedling emergence observed in this study suggest that recruitment plays a role in the maintenance of the species composition found in restored vegetation, with seedling emergence dominated by exotics The evaluation methodology developed within this Thesis is a transparent and accurate way to measure ecological changes in vegetation that have occurred as a result of restoration.The restoration evaluation methodology further developed here will be useful to an industry that involves tree planting, landcare, revegetation and bush regeneration. It will complement guidelines provided by government and other sources that advise on practical aspects of revegetation and will be one of the few which have examined the success of revegetation in ecological terms that are founded on sound scientific basis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cumberland Plain (NSW);</field><field name="subject">restoration ecology</field><field name="subject">revegetation</field><field name="subject">biotic communities</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration of achievement motivational patterns during adolescence using a 12- factor model across grades and sex</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Katrina B.</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that a multidimensional profile incorporating mastery goals, performance goals, social goals and extrinsic goals, as well as factors relating to self-perceptions, would provide a better understanding of achievement motivation in adolescents than a univariate or dichotomous framework. Additionally this thesis also explores whether the use of lower-order dimensions provides information that offers a more detailed analysis of achievement goals over and above that found by the higher-order factors alone. A newly developed multidimensional measure, the SMOSA (Self Motivational Orientation Scale for Adolescents) of achievement motivation was used to examine changes of different motivational pursuits and perceptions of self across grades and sex in an adolescent population. The information found provides a more detailed analysis than previous research, which relied on an evaluation of means to explain differences between samples. Therefore, educators will be provided with a comprehensive understanding of the patterns of change in achievement motivation during adolescence and such knowledge may equip them with a way of measuring students&#8217; approaches to facilitative learning and the ability to explore students&#8217; paths for optimal engagement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">achievement motivation</field><field name="subject">multidimensional scaling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economic impact of Asian migrants under Australian migration policy</field><field name="creator">Lam, David Taiwan</field><field name="description">For many years, migration has been intensively politicised in Australia. Political parties have different stands about migration and the government has raised its transparency to such a high level that the public is aware of developments and policy directions in migration for the present and future years. It was realized that well-educated migrants with skills and experience are able to accomplish better employment prospects and settlement outcomes. Skilled migration has therefore been emphasized. This thesis consists of a literature review on some of the motivations that support the objectives of migration over past years, outcomes brought by migration and overview of the migration program and main categories under skilled migration. As skilled migration has been placed with more emphasis since the 1990s and a larger quota has been allocated to facilitate younger migrants with the skills and expertise that are of use to Australia, it has become necessary to assess the economic impact brought by some of these skilled migrants. Coinciding with the emphasis of skilled migration, the trend of settler arrivals has changed so that Asians have increased their presence in Australia and the focus of this thesis is narrowed down to assess the economic impact of Asian groups. A description of general Asian culture and characteristics is also included in the literature review. Although Asians in Australia maintain their own cultures and some common characteristics, I have chosen the two biggest groups, namely Chinese and Vietnamese, to explore and identify their differences and economic contributions. Apart from ethnicity factor, other elements specifically educational attainment, occupational achievements, labour force status in which they have participated, age, English language proficiency, years of arrival and hours worked are tested for significance in enabling Chinese and Vietnamese migrants to earn income. This study also examines whether higher qualifications would increase the prospects of employability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asians in Australia</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese in Australia</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Asian immigration</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family love : a memoir and writing family love autobiographical novel to memoir, an exegesis.</field><field name="creator">Scott, Judy Rosemary</field><field name="description">When I first started thinking about writing Family Love I wanted to write it as an autobiographical novel. This meant a radical departure from my usual writing methods. For one thing, it was the first time in my writing life that I was interested in the conscious use of a period in my life as material for a novel. I had never before attempted this and felt a certain amount of apprehension in abandoning tried and true approaches for something so new and risky. Obviously there is an autobiographical basis to all my work but it expresses itself not in facts or events so much as oblique flashes, subconscious truths that arise out of the process of writing. In the creation of fictional characters in my novels, for example, I had never before set out to write about a particular person in the naturalistic sense. I have not been interested in telling someone&#8217;s story so much as becoming involved in the process of discovering and developing characters constructed from many sources including my own fantasies. A critic once described me as a method actor in the way I went about writing fiction, and, in particular, finding the voice of a character. This is an observation I find useful because there is something almost actorly about my immersion into fictional characters&#8217; lives. It is a complete identification which results in what could be loosely described as super realism. I am writing from life but from my own intensely observed construction of a life a construction which has its own rules, logic and momentum and often bears little resemblance to the facts or the real people.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autobiographical novel</field><field name="subject">personal memoirs</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Farming systems management of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for sustainable crop production in rice-based cropping systems</field><field name="creator">Wangiyana, Wayan</field><field name="description">In Lombok (Indonesia), annual cropping patterns in irrigated areas are divided into three cropping cycles of four months each. In better irrigation schemes, there are normally two irrigated flooded-rice crops, i.e. wet season and dry season lowland rice crops in sequence, followed by one non-rice crop cycle during the driest months (this is referred to as the twice-rice system). In less developed irrigation schemes, one lowland rice crop is normally grown during the rainy season, followed during the driest months by two cycles of non-rice crops, or a non-rice crop and a fallow (this is referred to as the once-rice system). In rainfed areas, especially in the vertisol soil areas, there are upland rice systems in the highland or hillsides, and &#8220;Gora&#8221; (dry seeded-flooded) rice systems in the lowland. In this area, rice is grown only once a year during the rainy season of the monsoon. Farmers in Lombok do not normally fertilise the non-rice crops such as soybean and mungbean grown following rice, and application rates of fertiliser to rice have fallen since the economic crisis in 1998. Therefore phosphorus (P) deficiency may be expected, which may explain the very low yields of soybean and mungbean achieved by farmers in Lombok. With low P, arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) might be expected to play an important role in plant nutrition, but inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increased root colonisation and yield of these crops in a recent field experiment in Lombok. There had been no survey of AMF populations in rice-based systems in Lombok prior to the work reported here, and little such work anywhere internationally. Therefore, an extensive survey was conducted in Lombok on the two main soil types with rice-based systems. Another field survey was conducted in the Riverina rice-growing area (Australia), as a comparative study to the Lombok survey. In Lombok, rice systems with longer total annual flooding duration had lower populations compared with upland or Gora rice systems. It was therefore suggested that the lower colonisation level in flooded rice was due to the flooded conditions, as well as soil chemical properties associated with flooded conditions, rather than the rice plant itself. There are options for improving AMF population for better growth of non-rice rotation crops, or even for rice crop in Lombok as fertilisers become less affordable and their use on flooded rice is declining. The easiest option is to inoculate AM fungi in the nursery or to make nursery beds in a paddock previously cropped with AMF-stimulating species, such as soybean, to start infection on rice seedlings, which should be better with a dry nursery. The second option is to modify the technique of growing rice, such as applying the SRI (System of Rice Intensification) principles, in which rice is grown without flooded conditions but intermittent short flooded and upland conditions. This will keep the soil in an aerobic condition much of the time and should facilitate the development of beneficial microbial populations and activities in the soil, such as AMF and nitrogen fixers. The SRI method has been reported to increase rice yield dramatically, even in soil with low fertility levels.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cropping systems</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Lombok (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">rice growing</field><field name="subject">sustainable crop production</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formula interest expression specification and propagation in peer-to-peer distributed virtual environments</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, Robert Graham</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the utility of interest management in peer-to-peer environments. Specifically, it proposes: a model for formulaic specification of interest criteria that is implementation neutral in terms of underlying interest operators (the functions that determine the satisfaction of interest); and, an interest management propagation model that ensures the specifications (termed formula interest expressions) are only sent to those DVE components that are likely to be able to satisfy the interest criteria. This selective propagation model uses a distributed index of supported interest operators to determine candidate remote filterers. Remote filtering ensures that a state change message is only sent if it meets the interest criteria previously expressed by the intended recipient. The selective remote filtering model requires no central infrastructure and is entirely supported by peer DVE components, which may join and leave the DVE dynamically. The performance of the proposed propagation model, in terms of the number of logical messages required, is compared to the only existing propagation model where interest expressions are simply sent to all participating DVE components. Analysis reveals that for stable long-lived DVEs the proposed model can significantly messaging overhead and thereby increase the potential scale-up of the DVE. The viability of the proposed model is examined by means of proof-of-concept system, which exercises the specification and propagation models over a range of values for key variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">virtual reality</field><field name="subject">virtual computer systems</field><field name="subject">shared virtual environments</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS), including a data mining methodology, for fetal-maternal clinical practice and research</field><field name="creator">Heath, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Existing patient medical records are a rich data source with a potential to support clinical research.

Why do we invest so heavily in our parents when they are long past their reproductive years? Adult children looking after their own offspring often face a double burden of care, and choosing to help aging parents is often in conflict with the primary evolutionary task of parenthood - your own genetic posterity by ensuring your children become parents themselves. Despite the large altruism literature, no one has yet addressed this particular issue. This thesis investigates this theoretical paradox and adds to the sparse empirical work on kin and nonkin-directed altruism. As a test of the two most popular Inclusive Fitness evolutionary explanations of altruistic behaviours; Kin Selection (Hamilton, 1964) and Reciprocal Altruism (Trivers, 1971), this study takes a side-wise look at helping attitudes and behaviours across multiple types of relationships. A Choice Model experiment assessed 453 people from all Australian states stratified by age (145 16-24 year olds; 162 25-54 year olds, and 146 over 55 year olds). Participants responded to sixteen hypothetical situations where they could choose to help only one person from two persons requiring their help. The scenarios contained ten variables (relationship type; sex, type of help; history of reciprocation etc.) that were systematically varied. Data was analysed using Hierarchical Bayesian estimation methods, and after factoring out our general tendency toward a species wide cooperation, found broad support for Inclusive Fitness principles. Generally, there was a clear pattern of helping behaviour that saw friends as of at least equal importance to more distant relatives (cousins etc). Elderly parents are helped for no better reason than they are needy and this is an unequivocal demonstration of our species&#8217; primary social imperative - cooperation - a clear inference that adult children are looking for the rewards that cooperation brings. This research also provides interesting insights into the nature of extended family dynamics as a sequelae of our rapid social evolution.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social participation</field><field name="subject">consensus (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">altruism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How can we shape our safety destiny-building capability and taking the pulse</field><field name="creator">Poon, Patrick Sui-kwong</field><field name="description">How do we shape our safety destiny? It is within the limits or our own making, that is, our capability. But, how do we know it is on the right track? In other words, how do we take the pulse? These questions set the context and scope of the research in which a number of key issues related to capability building and evaluation were addressed. In recent years, the approach of capability development has been widely researched by economists, organizational psychologists and management theorists. Unfortunately, because of its complex nature, the assessment of capability in professional context has not been properly addressed in the literature. The problem is two-fold. First, is criticality, or more accurately the lack of understanding about what capabilities are critical to our future success. The second one is concerned with the evaluative aspects of capability development. Using safety management as a study platform, this research introduced a contingency model of &#8220;strategic capability development&#8221; (SCD) as a plausible alternative to some of the well-established approaches. To address the evaluation issues, an innovative method for assessing capability maturity was constructed. The key variables were based on people&#8217;s pro-activeness and their self-efficacy beliefs. Through meta-analysis, a set of critical capabilities or indicators was identified and used as the key variables for designing the survey instrument, the Safety Management Efficacy Scale (SMES). These variables included goal-setting, risk management, safety training, risk communication, and operation/administration capabilities. Hypotheses regarding the interactive effects of each of these critical capabilities were then derived and tested. The results suggest that a high degree of coherency among the key variables does exit. There is a positive and significant association between critical capabilities and goal-setting capability. The positive effects of risk management capability on safety pro-activeness are strong. In regards to how goal-setting capability influences pro-activeness, no conclusion can be drawn. Having taking the pulse, the capability maturity profile of the safety profession is examined. The proposed SCD framework and SMES instrument together provide a point of departure for conducting similar research, including but not limited to human resources development, people capability maturity assessment, training/curriculum development, and performance evaluation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial safety</field><field name="subject">industrial hygiene</field><field name="subject">industrial efficiency</field><field name="subject">core competencies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of a logic-based access control system with dynamic policy updates and temporal constraints</field><field name="creator">Crescini, Vino Fernando</field><field name="description">As information systems evolve to cope with the ever increasing demand of today&#8217;s digital world, so does the need for more effective means of protecting information. In the early days of computing, information security started out as a branch of information technology. Over the years, several advances in information security have been made and, as a result, it is now considered a discipline in its own right. The most fundamental function of information security is to ensure that information flows to authorised entities, and at the same time, prevent unauthorised entities from accessing the protected information. In a typical information system, an access control system provides this function. Several advances in the field of information security have produced several access control models and implementations. However, as information technology evolves, the need for a better access control system increases. This dissertation proposes an effective, yet flexible access control system: the Policy Updater access control system. Policy Updater is a fully-implemented access control system that provides policy evaluations as well as dynamic policy updates. These functions are provided by the use of a logic-based language, L, to represent the underlying access control policies, constraints and policy update rules. The system performs authorisation query evaluations, as well as conditional and dynamic policy updates by translating language L policies to normal logic programs in a form suitable for evaluation using the well-known Stable Model semantics. In this thesis, we show the underlying mechanisms that make up the Policy Updater system, including the theoretical foundations of its formal language, the system structure, a full discussion of implementation issues and a performance analysis. Lastly, the thesis also proposes a non-trivial extension of the Policy Updater system that is capable of supporting temporal constraints. This is made possible by the integration of the well-established Temporal Interval Algebra into the extended authorisation language, language LT , which can also be translated into a normal logic program for evaluation. The formalisation of this extension, together with the full implementation details, are included in this dissertation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer security</field><field name="subject">database security</field><field name="subject">logic programming</field><field name="subject">computer safety</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The individual experience within a work team</field><field name="creator">Parris, Melissa A.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the research question: What is the individual's experience within a work team? The concern is for respondents' meaning and understanding of the team experience and how team membership impacts their lives. The introductory chapter considers the researcher's concerns leading to the formulation of this question, including the uncritical nature of much of the literature on teams and the limited attention given to impacts and outcomes for individual team members. These concerns are expanded further in a review of both current and extant literature on teams. The current research is predominantly focused on team effectiveness and productivity, and this research is examined before moving on to review research conducted into individual factors relating to teams using a qualitative research methodology. The Heideggerian phenomenology, used in this study, is discussed. Data analysis is outlined. The research methods lead to the development of the model, comprising four themes. The first theme discusses respondents' concerns regarding the positioning of their immediate team within broader team structures within the organisation. Next, respondents' desire for, and expectation of, support from within the team is considered. The third theme, ambiguity,examines the uncertainty experienced by respondents with respect to team goals. Finally, respondents' experiences of dissonance and incongruity with relation to their teams are discussed, again considering the related issues of organisational rhetoric and sensemaking. The implications for organisations is discussed, and avenues for future research are presented.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">workplace teams</field><field name="subject">Heideggerian methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indo-Fijian diasporic bodies : narratives in text, image, popular culture, and the lived everyday in Fiji and Liverpool, Sydney, Australia</field><field name="creator">Prasad, Mohit Manoj</field><field name="description">This thesis examines modalities of identity and representation for the Indo-Fijian diaspora and its second shift diasporic remove in Liverpool, Sydney, Australia.

Despite anecdotal data indicating that music therapy may be an effective intervention, there have been few studies to date which provide any rigorous empirical evidence. This project aimed to test several hypotheses. The study has shown that music therapy is a valuable therapeutic adjunct to standard ward programs for the management of an acute psychotic episode resulting in shorter hospital stays, considerable cost savings and significant improvement in symptomatology as judged by the standardized measures employed. In addition, EFG testing while listening to self-chosen music demonstrated a reduction in dysfunctional brain wave activity. This project has highlighted the importance of music therapy in allied mental health care and opens up the need for further research into the management of such a large disease burden in Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy</field><field name="subject">manic depressive illness</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative possibility : an introduction to, and a move towards, integral creativity</field><field name="creator">Plasto, Paddy</field><field name="description">Narrative Possibility: an introduction to, and a move towards, Integral Creativity is an exploration of creativity and a creative exploration, and it is a search for meaning and making which carries as backpressure an individual, societal, cultural, and global need for change. Change, as I have interpreted it, is a change of consciousness. While the exploration is multidimensional and multidirectional it has as its foundation a process of communication that is essential in and to all aspects of our present and past, showing and telling. Implicitly and explicitly we define ourselves and all that we encounter by stories. I am using the term &#8216;story&#8217; to mean showing and telling in all its forms but my approach, although it is predominantly aligned to Western interpretation, is a perspectival inquiry into and through word and image. It comprises and integrates stories by a layered methodology that includes diverse perspectives from theorists and artists. Among these: David Bohm, Andrew Wyeth, and Leonard Shlain are important, but, in the aspects of their work which focus on Integral Consciousness, Jean Gebser, Ken Wilber, and Terry Sands are most prominent. My exploration also incorporates stories of my lived experience as student, mother, visual artist, teacher and researcher, as well as fictional stories and poems. In both methodological structure and the writing and content of this work (in documenting its progress and in recording the unfolding visual work of several of my students,) I bring to this thesis my philosophical approach: Narrative Possibility -stories that do not have preconceived outcomes. Narrative Possibilities originate and manifest in and through (and require, therefore, a methodology that encompasses) Creative Events, States, Processes, and Products. It is a disciplined method that unfolds a story to a point in which all aspects appear to cohere, and yet this aspect of the story is untold: there are no definitive words or marks which obviously or even abstractly point to completion. Creativity, according to David Bohm, is a natural potential largely blocked by the way civilization has developed. I accept this premise and suggest that Narrative Possibility is a creative approach to integration and that it is a personal, social, and spiritual move towards our possible evolution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">narrative art</field><field name="subject">integral creativity</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neoshamanism and the shadow : 'the soul's journey'</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Robert E.</field><field name="description">This research investigates the shadow aspects of neoshamanic practice heuristically and phenomenologically using experiential workshops, image work and interviews. Neoshamanism, which is growing in popularity throughout Australia and the West, involves intentionally entering into Shamanic States of Consciousness (SSC) for the purposes of psycho-spiritual healing. According to neoshamans these SSC experiences are available to all. The research asks how neoshamanic practitioners understand their journeys into SSC, what the areas of commonality and difference between neoshamanic practitioners' experiences of SSC are, how image making in a workshop setting assists in revealing shadow manifestations, and what lasting effect shadow work and neoshamanic practice has in the practitioners lives? The study explores the lived experiences of seven participants &#8211; myself included &#8211; who engaged in a series of three experiential weekend workshops using neoshamanic practices and expressive arts. It consists of three main processes: the workshops, a series of semi-structured interviews over nine months with each participant, and individual journals used to record participant thoughts, feelings and images. The research is situated within the participants&#8217; and researcher&#8217;s lives, rather than on the periphery. The participants' journeys suggest that the SSC is an accessible and consistent phenomenon and is remarkably safe if approached within a positive environment. It is not a panacea for negativity nor a balm for shadow feelings of unworthiness; indeed the shadow work proved to be uncomfortable and disquieting for the ego. Neoshamanic practice is perhaps best understood as the soul's journey, providing a platform for soul recovery and living a life of authenticity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spiritual healing</field><field name="subject">Shamanism</field><field name="subject">Neoshamanism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nursing management of acutely ill older adults in hospital</field><field name="creator">Kilstoff, Kathleen</field><field name="description">The health care requirements of older people admitted to acute hospitals and their need for nursing care have been identified in current literature as problematic. Hospital organisations which are medically oriented and more focused on implementing programs directed by economics, efficiency and effectiveness may be unsupportive of nursing practices based on a professional value system. There is a need, therefore, to examine how health care structures that tend to promote cost containment and a technical imperative, impact on the professional capability of nurses to provide the standard of care required by acutely ill older hospitalised patients. The collected data, analysed thematically, indicates that the nurses were knowledgeable and potentially competent in providing the standard of technical and functional care required by older adults in hospital. However, although nurses articulated that they wanted to provide the quality of care needed by acutely ill older patients, they nevertheless admitted they were optionalising this care because of constraints in the health care system.While the nurses&#8217; constructions revealed they believed technical tasks took up most of their time during shifts, it is evident during the observations that this was not the case. Through the use of Giddens&#8217;s (1984) Structuration Theory, a very different picture began to unfold about the incongruence about was said, and what was actually done. The significance of this study is that the incongruence found between the nurses&#8217; knowledge and their actions has been revealed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">hospital care</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">nursing the elderly</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the effectiveness of participatory research in agriculture</field><field name="creator">Jennings, Jess R.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effectiveness of participatory research processes as a form of agricultural extension within the Australian Dairy Industry, and specifically addresses the question : Does Action Research provide an effective methodology and method(s) for enacting farmer-driven research? The experiences of the Dairy Australian-funded Profitable Pastures Protection Project (PPP), delivered to farmers across New South Wales from 1999 to 2003, provided the context within which Action Research was assessed. Data were derived from journal records of the researcher&#8217;s personal experiences as a participant observer, a PhD candidate and project coordinator. The other main data sources were industry reports that tracked the progress, outputs and outcomes of PPP. A three-tiered research framework, consisting of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary levels was devised as a basis to direct research, and interpret results. Conclusions are drawn that contemporary extension practice can be improved by better linking the on-and off-farm domains using participatory research processes such as Action Research. Meeting this challenge appears increasingly urgent in light of a globally relevant and strengthening off-farm environmental agenda that requires democratic engagement amongst greater numbers of agricultural stakeholders. This environmental agenda also places still greater demands on farmers, their management systems and the products and effects of the on-farm domain.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">agricultural research</field><field name="subject">participation observation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A panel in GARCH analysis of stock return volatility in an emerging market: a case study of Egypt</field><field name="creator">Bakry, Walid K.</field><field name="description">The modelling of stock market volatility is considered to be important for practitioners and academics in finance due to its use in forecasting aspects of future returns. The GARCH class models have now firmly established themselves as one of the foremost techniques for modelling volatility in financial markets. The application of GARCH class models in developed and emerging markets (including the Egyptian Stock Market) provides evidence of GARCH effects in stock returns. However, most of the studies conducted on modelling the volatility of stock returns are based on the aggregated market index. This thesis argues that this will not reflect significant differences of variation in the pattern of volatility associated with different stocks. However, in order to examine the similarities and differences between the conditional variance structures of stocks from the same or different industries in the same equity market, this thesis estimates pooled-panel models. These novel models are used to test for similarities and differences in the conditional variance equation in panels of time series within a general to specific framework of nested tests. This is done using panel samples of sector indices and stocks from the Egyptian Stock Market covering the period from 1997 to 2002. The results suggest that there are similarities in the temporal volatility structures of stocks from the same sector or industry, but there are significant differences in the temporal volatility structures of stocks from different sectors or industries. This suggests that using indices alone for modelling the volatility of an equity market, which is the method used in the majority of studies cited in the literature, may not be appropriate. The thesis concludes with a discussion of some of the implications of these results and suggestions for further research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GARCH analysis</field><field name="subject">economic forecasting</field><field name="subject">Egypt</field><field name="subject">economic indiciators</field><field name="subject">efficient market theory</field><field name="subject">stock markets</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance analysis of single code spread ALOHA systems</field><field name="creator">Achi, Hassan</field><field name="description">Spread ALOHA has become one of the advanced multiple access techniques promising several advantages over existing conventional and spread spectrum based wireless systems. Spread ALOHA is currently recognised as a simplified wireless multiple access system which provides a higher bandwidth and may accommodate high number of users. This thesis investigates the employment of a unique spreading code in conjunction with Spread ALOHA as opposed to the common method of employing distinct spreading codes for all users on the communication channel. This feature of Spread ALOHA would eliminate the limitation on the number of users imposed by finding sufficient orthogonal spreading codes, and moreover it would simplify the system and reduce the receiver complexity. In this research I have investigated the state of the art on this topic, and I have modelled and simulated a Single Code Spread ALOHA system together with a conventional CDMA ALOHA system in order to analyse and compare the performance of both systems. This study has shown the viability of employing single code in Spread ALOHA systems, and hence eliminating what is considered a limiting factor in other systems such as CDMA. The performance of this proposed system is comparable with that of CDMA; however the selection of suitable PN codes is essential. The parametric study in this work was aimed to find optimum performance criteria for the Spread ALOHA system. all users on the spread spectrum system to have equal average; received power levels.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">code division multiple access</field><field name="subject">Spread ALOHA</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pre season balance and jump landing training program and its effect upon female basketballers' static and dynamic balance and knee and ankle injury rates</field><field name="creator">Sampson, Lorrae J.</field><field name="description">The effect of a preseason conditioning program of balance and jump landing training exercises was studied to evaluate its influence on static and dynamic balance and the occurrence of ankle and knee injuries in Basketball. Fifty-eight female representative Basketball players (aged 9 &#8211; 17 years) were studied over one season. Twenty-nine of these players participated in a six week training program implemented during the preseason. Pre and post tests measured balance and injuries documented over one season. The experimental group&#8217;s static and dynamic balance improved significantly as measured by a stork stand test and a multiple single-leg hop-stabilisation test In a post hoc analysis of dynamic balance, participants in the 12 &#8211; 13 years experimental group performed significantly better on dynamic balance, whereas the 12 &#8211; 13 years control group performed poorest compared with all other age cohorts. The lower limb injury rate for the 29 experimental group participants was .78 injuries per 1 000 hours, while the control group sustained no lower limb injuries in the 2001 season, based on the injury definition utilised in the study. This finding was statistically significant although three of the four injuries sustained were contact injuries. The study findings indicate that appropriately defined balance training can be beneficial for improving balance ability in female Basketball players. Evidence was found in the study for the existence of a critical age when balance training should be introduced to maximise the benefit for young female adolescent Basketball players.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">basketball</field><field name="subject">injuries</field><field name="subject">female basketballers</field><field name="subject">knee injuries</field><field name="subject">ankle injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychophysical aspects of retronasal chemosensory perception</field><field name="creator">Wilkes, Fiona J.</field><field name="description">In two parts, this thesis examined retronasal perception of single odours, binary odour mixtures and odour-taste mixtures. Part 1, aimed to determine if perceived retronasal temporal order differs to that order perceived via the orthonasal pathway and if retronasal temporal order is a function of an odorant&#8217;s water solubility or nasal mucus solubility slowing the odorants progression to the olfactory epithelium via the longer retronasal route. Part 1 established that retronasal temporal perception of binary odour mixtures differs from orthonasal temporal perception and that nasal mucus solubility and the &#8220;stickiness&#8221;, mediated by volatility, are the factors determining the perceived retronasal order. It was further concluded that nasal mucus and not water was the most appropriate approximation to the composition of nasopharyngeal mucus. Part 2, aimed to determine if correct retronasal odour identification is a function of learned taste-associations and if correct retronasal odour identification is a function of the modality through which the odour is learned. Part 2, established that in simple binary odour-taste mixtures correct retronasal odour identification is not a function of learned taste-associations, nor do tastants suppress odours. However, it was concluded that mouth-learning experience does provide odours with an identification advantage retronasally, over odours that are not learned through the mouth. Overall, the Thesis demonstrated that differences exist between retronasal and orthonasal perception. Specifically, the perceived temporal order of components in binary odours mixtures is determined retronasally by an odour&#8217;s nasal mucus solubility and &#8220;stickiness&#8221;. The exploration of this mechanism in future research may provide a greater understanding of temporal odour perception and the means to increase odour mixture component identification beyond the current limit of three. Furthermore, retronasal odour and taste processing seem to occur independently of each other, as learned-associations between taste and odours do not impact on the accuracy of mixture component identification or intensity. It may be that it is mouth-learning experience or a relationship to food that is important to retronasal odour perception rather than any component congruency. Future research should aim to determine if it is mouth experience or the contribution of other stimuli such as tactile cues that contribute to the increase in retronasal identification accuracy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemical senses</field><field name="subject">retronasal perception</field><field name="subject">olfactions</field><field name="subject">smell</field><field name="subject">taste</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the potential environmental effects of soluble hydraulic oil on natural waters</field><field name="creator">Agars, Robert C</field><field name="description">A series of physical and chemical analyses were conducted over a fifteen month period to establish the ecological risk, if any, of discharging minewater into aquatic ecosystems.

Throughout the sampling period the pithead discharge water exhibited a neutral pH and low levels of iron, manganese, zinc and potassium were found. Parallel toxicological and chemical studies identified elevated zinc levels above published toxicity levels for the test species Ceriodaphnia Dubia, but were not confirmed by subsequent study. The presence of organic species in the pit head discharge water was also identified, but the levels were found to be quite variable. Treatment processes involving the detention of the surface minewater and subsequent passage through wetlands exhibited a beneficial effect in reducing pollutant levels prior to disposal.

The study also examined whether exposure of men reporting high or low gender role conflict to either emotion-focused or thought-focused therapy through the use of a counselling video influences subsequent preference for type of therapy, and the role of coping as a mediator in the relationship between gender role conflict and therapy preference. Furthermore, the study examined traditional men&#8217;s perspectives on therapy focussing in particular on issues inherent in living with the experience of depression: coping with depression, seeking help for depression, and the barriers to seeking help. The central aim of the thesis was to examine how to make psychological services more appealing to men who have experienced depression. Overall the current research revealed insights into men&#8217;s experience of depression, their therapy preferences, their coping strategies, the physical and psychosocial barriers that deter them from seeking help, and many practical suggestions for possible interventions to help men cross the barriers and open up. It is concluded that understanding the traditional men, their socialisation and its impact on depression, on the man&#8217;s help-seeking behaviour and attitudes, is certainly needed to assist in meeting the needs of men and to influence the transformation of traditional men.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression in men</field><field name="subject">depression therapy</field><field name="subject">gender role conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metaphorical prison : nurses, adolescents with anorexia nervosa and the formation of therapeutic relationships within a 'behaviour-modification' program.</field><field name="creator">Ramjan, Lucie Michelle</field><field name="description">The increasing prevalence and severity of anorexia among the young has led to an increase in the number of paediatric hospital admissions and readmissions over the years. Moreover there has been a significant drop in the age of patients being admitted to hospitals for treatment. Recognising the importance of the nursing role and the therapeutic relationship, this thesis reports specific detailed insights into the daily routine of nurses and adolescents with anorexia on a ward, which bases its re-feeding program on behaviour-modification principles (&#8216;The Level System&#8217;), and the impact of this program on nurse-patient relationships. In many ways, life for an adolescent with anorexia on the ward mirrored life for a prison inmate. Within &#8216;The Level System&#8217; program, nurses and doctors became analogous to prison officers. The subsequent themes reflect these similarities. The study provides positive recommendations for constructive change to improve the lives of both nurses and patients and further enhances lay and professional understandings of the nursing care for adolescents with anorexia within a behaviour-modification treatment program.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anorexia nervosa</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">nurse and patient</field><field name="subject">anorexia nervosa in adolescents</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">nutritional aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">More than just a good CV : creating a favourable first impression in job interviews</field><field name="creator">Candita, Julia Eileen</field><field name="description">Based on analyses of recorded real-life selection interviews in a law firm and in a government department, this study illustrates how crucial it is for job applicants to use the valuable skill of Impression Management (IM), that is, the attempt to portray a particular image by controlling the information available to others so that they will view the actor as he or she intended. By using verbal and non-verbal behaviours persuasively, job applicants can create an image of professionalism in a short period of time, structuring the interviewers&#8217; impressions formed of the applicant in order to lead to high suitability ratings and job. Currently, there is much competition for jobs, hence applicants are faced with increasingly sophisticated selection techniques that aim to ensure only the best applicants are appointed. This study is located within the fields of communication and selection interviewing research and is underpinned by moral and ethical issues in regard to the deployment of power and empowerment of job applicants. The necessarily communicative approach involved qualitative data collection and description i.e. Conversation Analysis (CA) and Content Analysis (ContA). It is argued that because power influences language and language influences power, applicants may empower themselves in interviews by examining their beliefs and by adopting more powerful verbal behaviour. In time, and with further academic inquiry, more equality in interpersonal relations in the workplace could become the norm. The hope is that this study could be a catalyst for future research on preventing misuse of power through communication in the workplace and in social life.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interviewing</field><field name="subject">employment interviewing</field><field name="subject">management and communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The moral dimensions of design : the re-emergence of the design manifestos and their effect.</field><field name="creator">Park, Julia J.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the re-emergence of the design manifestos since the 1990s to articulate what these manifestos tell us about the morality of design.

These moral dimensions invite specifically, graphic designers to look closely at their actions as design agents and to incorporate research, theory and practice as a unit of design process. In so doing, the graphic designer will work towards a user-centred outcome while showing sensitivity to their society, culture, politics, technologies and natural environments. This thesis also presents my project explorations drawn from my hypothesis of the moral dimensions of design to extract insight to the graphic design process and practice encouraged by the six manifestos.

These activation relationships allow genes to control whether other associated genes get expressed in the phenotype. More specifically, this thesis investigates the effect that the incorporation of control levels (tiers of genes which determine the activation of lower genes) have on GAs which are used to generate feed forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In order to evaluate the performance of different levelled Structured Genetic Algorithms (SGAs; they are GAs which possess control levels), numerous experiments were conducted, utilising the four input XOR, Mackey-Glass and Breast Cancer data sets. In addition, the thesis derives four mathematical models which describe how SGA redundancy changes as more control levels are incorporated. This thesis also presented and implemented a novel four level Structurally Evolved Neural Network Algorithm (SENNGA). Furthermore, it demonstrated the novel implementation of a three level SENNGA. Empirical results show that the incorporation of control levels can improve convergence speed and accuracy, up until the optimum number of control levels is reached. In all experiments increasing the number of control levels had the effect of encouraging the production of leaner and more efficient ANNs. Three and four level SENNGAs can demonstrate superior performance in terms of reducing the training error and generalisation. However this does not apply in all cases. Of particular note, three and four level SENNGAs have exhibited a reduced level of generalisation in the breast cancer experiments, compared two level ones.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multiple goal analysis of female Japanese university students' general academic motivation and motivation towards EFL.</field><field name="creator">Da Silva, Dexter E.</field><field name="description">This purpose of this study was to examine the motivation of first-year female Japanese university students towards university study in general and towards the study of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in particular. The study used Maehr&#8217;s multiple goal model of Personal Investment as its theoretical basis. Two forms of a bilingual Inventory of University Motivation (IUM) were created. One refers to university study in general, the IUM-Gen; the other refers specifically to the study of EFL, the IUM-Eng. The two forms of the IUM were adaptations of McInerney&#8217;s Inventory of School Motivation (ISM) and were also translated into Japanese and then back-translated. Data from these questionnaires were collected from 501 first year university students at a Japanese women&#8217;s university and analysed using four sets of exploratory Principal Components Analyses (PCA). These analyses produced clear scales with solid loadings, thus supporting the construct validity of the instrument. Each scale had strong reliability as measured by Cronbach&#8217;s alpha. Mean scales, based on the items loading on the derived factors, were used to develop an overall motivational profile of the students. Some features of this profile contradicted strongly held beliefs about Japanese university students&#8217; lack of motivation, as well as about their supposed collectivist qualities. Other features provided support for the argument that the study of EFL is important to female Japanese university students, suggesting that English ability is perceived as a skill which can provide them with attractive personal and professional possibilities. Multiple regression analyses were performed using the resulting scales of the IUM-Gen and IUM-Eng separately against the above outcome measures. Significant relationships were found between some of the predictor variables, the scales of the two forms of the IUM, and some of the criterion variables, the outcome measures. The three IUM-Eng subscales of Sense of Competence in English, Competition in English, and Social Concern in English (negative), and the two IUM-Gen subscales of Affiliation at University and Self-esteem at University, were the predictor variables of most significance. The results of these analyses provide support for the applicability of the theoretical model and both forms of the measurement instrument in this socio-cultural context. They also show the instrument to be very useful at extracting important predictors of academic success at studying EFL at a Japanese university, and make some important contributions to the growing research agenda in motivation in EFL.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivation in education</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">college students</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">female college students</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterization of components from whey</field><field name="creator">Xu, Yue</field><field name="description">The structure, functionality, isolation methods and applications of whey components, particularly the proteins and lactose, have been extensively studied. These studies have had a great impact on the food industry where whey components are increasingly being used as food ingredients. Two generations of whey protein product, namely Lactalbumin, produced by heat-induced precipitation, and Whey Protein Concentration/ Isloate, produced by ultrafiltration/ ion exchange chromatography, have been commercialised. Crystalline lactose in the food and pharmaceutical grades is also being produced. Recently, research activities in whey fractionation have shifted to the isolation of the minor components. This thesis is aimed at developing a Total Whey Utilization strategy by which the several components of the whey stream would be completely recovered by fractionation, resulting in little or no residue to be disposed of in the wastewater stream. Therefore, this study was initially dedicated to the development of novel separation methods which would be suitable for the Total Whey Utilization process. The development of those techniques revealed some previously unknown feature of whey components. The mechanisms of the separation methods have been also investigated. Although crystallization is an efficient method for fractionation or purification, its disadvantage is that the mother liquor is a wastewater containing high salt and BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand). The chromatographic method has been investigated in this work to separate the mother liquor or permeate into lactose and mineral fractions such that a goal of this thesis, namely a 'clean' water stream after processing whey, can be finally achieved. These studies have focused on the effect of resin type, salt form of the resin and the operating conditions on the separation of the lactose and mineral fraction.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resin</field><field name="subject">whey</field><field name="subject">purification</field><field name="subject">lactose</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">crystallization</field><field name="subject">isolation methods</field><field name="subject">separation</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's my turn! : critical discourse analysis and the emergence of gendered subjectivity through children's games</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Alyson Melanie</field><field name="description">This thesis is positioned at the intersection of two fields of research: language and gender and language development, to address the lack of linguistically informed investigation into the emergence of gendered subjectivity. Rather than treat the domain of language and gender research as a site of resolve, the research problematises the area to create a site of contestation by drawing attention to the limitations of research based on a single theoretical framework which proposes unified gender identity as gender difference. Gender will be read not as singular identity but multiple, as a Foucauldian 'nexus of subjectivities'. The study is an investigation into the construction of gendered subjectivity through a critical discourse analysis of a family playing games. The initial contention is that gender is a process which may be performed in multiple ways which are linked to the subject positions taken up in competing discourses. Focusing on children playing games, the study examines how gendered relationships are constructed in discursive practices to propose that it is possible to identify the performance of multiple femininities/masculinites through an analysis of patterns of interaction where the negotiation of power relationships is made visible in language and action. The study is a reflexive ethnographic case study based on data collected of two siblings, a boy and a girl, and their parents playing games at home. Conducted from within a framework which strategically combines poststructuralist readings with linguistic analysis, the research is an example of the viability of 'postlinguistic' approach to discourse analysis. The thesis argues that the study of a culture as it is lived in a family reveals the emergence of gendered subjectivity in the constitutive relationship which exits language, subjectivity and discourse. It is suggested that the development of a child's multiple gendered identities towards normative gender patterns may be traced in the discursive practices which s/he mobilises as a result of the subject positions in which s/he is positioned during the research period</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucault, Michel, 1926-1984</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jigsaw : looking at identity, post-colonialism and driving</field><field name="creator">Barlow, Gillian</field><field name="description">This thesis is in the form of a novel about three work colleagues who, as part of their job, have to drive long distances together. The story is told from the perspective of all of them but mainly from one of the women who tells the story in the first person. The man and two women are so different from each other in personality and outlook on life, and the basis of the novel is their interactions with each other, the frictions within their relationships, and the thoughts that go through their heads while they are driving. These people spend long hours together in the car and in motel rooms yet they never get any closer to each other. The only one of them who seems to get anything from the experience is the woman who is in the first person, as she achieves a greater sense of her own identity.

Existing studies have derived their innovation processes from large companies&#8217; perspectives and have not considered the needs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Different types of innovation will require different resources and, therefore, will need to be managed differently. Little research has been aimed at identifying innovation processes from a knowledge-based perspective. Although a fascinating array of innovation research has been carried out in the context of R and D issues and economic factors, the knowledge/innovation gaps and the gaps of innovation perspectives between larger/smaller firms should be filled in to map a more comprehensive picture of the proposition. This research is aimed at bridging these gaps through the leveraging sources of innovation, both the internal and external supporting processes of innovation and the construction of the innovation supply chain. The study suggests that, due to the integrated innovation models and propositions, future researchers will be able to undertake an empirical study for more high-tech SMEs in a selected high-tech industry to obtain a generalised result for specific high-tech industries. Also, the integrated innovation models and propositions can be used to undertake case studies or empirical studies for the other SMEs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">intellectual capital</field><field name="subject">technological innovation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life in the middle : middle managers' experiences in and out of the workplace</field><field name="creator">Parris, Melissa A.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the research question: What are the day-to-day work experiences of middle managers, and how do these experiences personally impact them in and beyond the workplace?

The two problems of lack of recognition of participatory practices and the lack of address of sustainability matters are drawn into one collective inquiry initiative. Twelve Australian participatory practitioners, working in three states, in various aspects of social and environmental sustainability in the public, community and academic sectors voluntarily participated in the initiative for over eighteen months. The author, being the initiating researcher and practising participatory principles from the outset, chose not to facilitate a pre-determined method at any stage so as to let a systemic form of inquiry come into being. Working through three emergent iterations, the Inquiry and its thesis propose that globally, participatory practices are distinguishable in four generic constituents of Governance, Development, Learning and Activism and that incorporating all four of these elements constitutes a participatory practice with transformative qualities at systemic scales. Practically, the co-researchers created participatory practices from an eclectic range of such traditions, modes and disciplines, integrated through dialogic, reflexive, autobiographical and contextual inclusions. The ongoing Inquiry entity resists collapse to a defaulted instrumentalist stance and continues to unfold as a sociological embodiment of the thought it generates. Referring to Polanyi, Bohm, Bourdieu, Foucault, Torbert and Miller the author interprets the Inquiry&#8217;s legacy as establishing an articulate, committed and responsive open community within which we freely develop capabilities that are inhibited by our daily life worlds while also crucial for transformation towards participatory sustainability in these same worlds.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">participatory development</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">sustainable design</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long term preservation of textual information in the AEC sector</field><field name="creator">Bader, Refad</field><field name="description">As we are living in a vast changing technological era, the hardware and software required to read electronic documents continue to evolve, and the technology may be so different in the near future that it may not work on older documents.

The research seeks to: analyse the theoretical foundations of Islamic baking and practice in Bangladesh; examine areas of similarity and differences between the structure and practices of Islamic banking and conventional banks; and identify the problems, challenges and prospects of Islamic banking in Bangladesh. The dissertation examines primary and secondary sources and draws on fieldwork in Bangladesh and the author&#8217;s personal experiences. The study undertaken shows that over the years there has been an expansion of Islamic banking in Bangladesh. Islamic banks are competing successfully with their conventional counterparts in an environment where rules, regulations and regulatory bodies are designed to facilitate banking based on interest. At the same time it has become apparent that the profit and loss sharing framework, which is one of the cardinal principles of Islamic banking, has yet to take deep root. The current profitability of Islamic banks is often maintained by products and services, which on closer analysis resemble broadly the products of conventional banking. It is thus suggested that more in depth research should be undertaken by Islamic bankers and scholars to study products and services of conventional banking with a view to adapting them successfully to the tenets of shari&#8217;ah.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religious aspects of banking</field><field name="subject">Islamic legal system</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Never trust a cop who doesn't drink : a critical study of the challenges and opportunities for reducing high levels of alcohol consumption within an occupational culture</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Rodney</field><field name="description">Police culture often valorises 'hard' drinking, and in NSW police label their heavy drinkers 'heroes'.

In undertaking this study two cycles of a systemic action research were followed, the first to explore the policy development environment and the second to validate and expand on findings of the first cycle of enquiry. The thesis follows the historical development of policy institutions and the deliberations of poicy actors that have lead to normative, strategic and program change within these institutions. These institutional changes have then been critiqued from theoretical perspective of governance for sustainable development. Conclusions from this critique indicate that that the pace of policy change is very slow and after 20 years from the Rural Policy green paper of 1974 the federal institutions have taken on board a rhetoric of sustainable rural development that encapsulates much of the principles espoused in the Green Paper.This includes principles that aim to empower rural communities to find local solutions to their natural resource management and local economic development problems. The downside is found in institutional conflict over resource dependencies and spheres of responsibility and an apparent lack of community economic development facilitation skills within the service organisations of rural institutions.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural land use (Australia)</field><field name="subject">sustainable agriculture (Australia)</field><field name="subject">government policy on agriculture (Australia)</field><field name="subject">economic aspects of rural development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Koalas and the community : a study of low density populations in Southern Sydney</field><field name="creator">Ward, Steven J.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, density, health, condition, fertility, causes of mortality, home range size and tree preferences, of koalas in low density populations in the south of Sydney.

Nutrition infrastructure and services have developed systematically, incrementally and substantially. Strengths include the development of enduring and successful inter-cultural partnerships and leadership.Two facilitative narratives which aim to improve inter-cultural knowledge sharing, strengthen capacity and promote participatory action in community based projects were developed, implemented and partially evaluated. Services can be further strengthened by long-term commitments to examining power issues, promoting improved Indigenous control and problem solving and comprehensive bi cultural evaluation that identifies significant indicators to improving outcomes.

This maximised the capacity of the soil to take up and store water during autumn and winter.Three grazing experiments and one spaced-plant species evaluation study were used to assess the role of summer-growing, C4 Eragrostis curvula in pastures in the temperate zone of southeastern Australia.Issues relating to pasture production and the productivity of wool-growing sheep were investigated. Factors affecting the sustainability of the pastures and their potential on and off site impacts were emphasised.Modelling was used to explore issues of water use, arising from the grazing experiments. It is concluded that the persistence, production, water use patterns, and the adaptability of palatable varieties of E. curvula make it a useful and complementary addition to the range of species that are currently available for use as sown pastures in southern Australia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eragrostis curvula</field><field name="subject">weeping lovegrass (S.E.Australia)</field><field name="subject">vegetation (S.E.Australia),</field><field name="subject">temperate pastures</field><field name="subject">native grasses (S.E.Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Brendon F.</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is to emphasise the lived experience of being a migrant, and of living in a multicultural society, and to acknowledge the multi-dimensionality of these experiences. The author conducted interviews with people from ethno-specific community groups in the Sydney suburb of Auburn. These interviews explored the physical, emotional and spiritual aspect of coming to terms with a changing sense of what is home and what is foreign. The tenor of the thesis is strongly optimistic and explores the social ecology of multiculturalism in Australia in the late 1990's, using Auburn, with its strong immigrant population and large Turkish community, as a case study. The contributions by the people of Auburn are woven through the thesis as voices in their own right, rather than as quotations for a line of argument. Social ecology, as a project, works to open up dimensions of awareness and to acknowledge complexity by addressing the physical and sensory levels of individual experience as well as the broader political and social contexts which frame people's lives. The thesis acknowledges that the success of contemporary Australian multiculturalism has something to do with the broad based policies that implement this social phenomenon. More importantly, multiculturalism succeeds because it has become the culture scape in which the soul of the community wanders. This thesis acknowledges that there is something intellectually difficult about the word soul, but there is an ecological value in James Hillman's idea of the soul as not an elevated idea but rather one 'down in the earth'; soul in this sense is about place, finding and taking root in a new place.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migrant experience</field><field name="subject">multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">social ecology</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">idea of soul</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social consciousness in the work of Beckmann and Kentridge : an artist's view</field><field name="creator">Wishart, Lionel H.</field><field name="description">This study is about how a social consciousness is made visible in the paintings and drawings of two artists who have in common an urge to examine the human condition in the context of traumatic social and political circumstances.

This was addressed by using a qualitative, multi-methodological research methodology to examine both current theory and the practical experiences and opinions of local government professionals. The literature review focused on the emerging theory field of &#8216;policy dialogue&#8217; - the local governance and the importance of spatial information (SI) and geographic information systems (GIS) for supporting decisions. The interview analysis of sample Greater Western Sydney (GWS) council professionals confirmed the complexity of local government policy. A significant issue that hindered policy development across the participating local governments was the occurrence of silo cultures within internal and external relationships between council officers. The second interview phase with GWS council professionals, followed by a demonstration of an OSP concept (GWSspatial), identified the applications, opportunities and challenges for the development and use of a technological spatial innovation. The key applications identified were- sharing and knowledge management of SI, immediate management of SI, immediate online access and integration of local/regional SI, and analysis opportunities to facilitate purposeful dialogue and informed decision making by council professionals within a region. Policy framework case studies were conducted at three scales: the Pitt Town development &#8211; at LGA level; Bushfire emergency management &#8211; at cross jurisdictional level; and the Sydney Metropolitan Strategy - at regional level. The catalysts, which trigger the need, acceptance and commitment of decision makers, thereby supporting the key applications of a technological spatial innovation include disaster response, critical environment management challenges and regional land use planning and management.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">political geography</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving out : the impact of deinstitutionalisation on salient affective variables, social competence and social skills of people with mild intellectual disabilities</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Roselyn M.</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the social competency and affective functioning of people with mild intellectual disabilities through salient variables that impact on people with disabilities who have been deinstitutionalised.

Since then, multiculturalism in Australia, as elsewhere in the western world, has come under sustained critique by both those who think it has &#8216;gone too far&#8217;, and those who think it has &#8216;not gone far enough&#8217;. These critiques have left many wondering whether multiculturalism is still an appropriate and valuable response to cultural diversity for both governments/the state and the populations who contend with cultural diversity as part of their everyday lives. This study attempts to move beyond these critiques and proposes a local place-bound study as one way in which we might further our understandings of multiculturalism in the Australian context and capture some of the complexities elided by these nonetheless useful critiques. The study draws on both textual and ethnographic research material, and employs discursive and deconstructive techniques of analysis to achieve this. The population of the regional centre of Griffith in the Riverina region of New South Wales is culturally diverse. Griffith is located within Wiradjuri country and became home to large numbers of non-Indigenous people after the establishment of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Scheme in the 1910s. It continues to be a destination of choice for immigrants, largely because of the availability of work, particularly in agricultural and related industries. The study reveals that in Griffith multiculturalism is generated, negotiated and performed at the local level, in and through the everyday lives of local people, as much as it is through government intervention. It is part of the lived experience of people in culturally diverse Griffith. The kind of multiculturalism they live can be seen to be positive, pervasive and dynamic and it is something that is deemed to be of great value. They have embraced the idea of multiculturalism and of their community as multicultural to the extent that it is an important part of how they see themselves. While Australian Federal Government conceptions of multiculturalism clearly inform local discourses, with all the limitations this can bring, the conservative understandings articulated federally are made redundant by local manifestations of multiculturalism in Griffith, where there is a desire to both foster and further multiculturalism. The case of Griffith suggests that there is hope for multiculturalism and that multiculturalism can still inform an ethical mode of engagement for people from diverse cultural and ethnic traditions. Australia, however, also has an Indigenous past and present and this continues to pose the ultimate challenge to and for multiculturalism, including in Griffith.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Griffith (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">national characteristics, Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pastoralists, participation and policy : an action oriented, systemic and participatory approach to improve the relationships between pastoralist nomads, government and natural resources in Iran</field><field name="creator">Emadi, Mohammad H.</field><field name="description">The study focuses on the relationships between nomads, the government and the natural resource base of Iran as a problematical situation. The research approach adopted was action-oriented with an emphasis on the process of development through the integration of theory with practice in a critical learning system designed to improve the situation and emphasising the significance of systemic thinking and acting.The underlying rationale for the approach is that the relatively limited achievements in nomadic development and natural conservation to date stem from the fact that policies are: (a) based on a reductionist view point and analysis, which separates theory from practice, and neglects the diversity, complexity and recursiveness of the different dimensions of nomadic life; and (b) developed on the basis of government perceptions of the nature of the issues confronting nomads rather than on the basis of shared concerns with the nomads themselves. There were three phases of fieldwork which, when taken together, represent what might be termed a system of systemic research methodologies. The first phase of the fieldwork was an attempt to explore the problematic situation from the point of view of particular group of nomads and government agents. The second phase of research turned to an action-oriented approach to establish the process of conversation and mutual recognition and accommodation of change among &#8216;clients&#8217; and the researcher as facilitator to help each group of participants (nomads and government) to understand their own position and worldviews, to help each group of participants to recognise and appreciate differences in their positions, perceptions, and to establish a framework for action and improving the situation within each group could benefit in a reciprocal manner. The third phase of research focused on the learning organisation as a strategy to improve relationships. The recursive nature of the research, both in terms of relationship between theory and practice and also its three phases, is reflected in the structure of the thesis.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nomads (Iran)</field><field name="subject">Iranian pastoral systems</field><field name="subject">rural development (Iran)</field><field name="subject">conservation of natural resources (Iran)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to develop participative processes to improve farming systems in the Balonne Shire, Queensland</field><field name="creator">Christodoulou, Nicholas</field><field name="description">This thesis develops two related themes.The first is that participatory approaches to agricultural research and extension can provide a sound process for all stakeholders to learn how to develop more sustainable agriculture.

While market gardening is readily perceived to be detrimental to waterways, there is remarkably little data to quantify the impacts. Soil and nutrient loss in stormwater runoff varies with soil type, climate and production systems. Therefore local data are needed to determine the impact of market gardening on the Hawkesbury-Nepean. This should lead to a better understanding of how land management influences runoff quantity and quality so that practices can be improved. Objectives of this research were to : quantify sediment, N and P loss and assess the implications for waterways; relate sediment, N and P losses to specific land management practices and assess their impacts on profitability; and, reflect on this research in terms of extension and adoption of better land management. An 8.8 ha property with 6.6 ha of market garden was used as a case study in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment. Soil samples were collected at the beginning and end of the study. Sediment core samples were collected from the drainage channel. A rainfall simulator was used to compare runoff volume from green manure and bare fallow beds. The research produced several recommendations for the extension and adoption of improved land management. In order to reduce sediment, N and P losses in stormwater, the primary focus should be on improving soil and nutrient management, in particular matching fertiliser inputs more closely to nutrient requirements. The secondary focus should be on utilising structural measures, in particular farm dams, to prevent pollutants from entering waterways. The outcome should be decreased costs to the farmer and decreased impacts on waterways. The use of N-fixing green manure to decrease the use of poultry manure should be explored.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stormwater</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="subject">fertiliser</field><field name="subject">soil pollutants</field><field name="subject">land management</field><field name="subject">soil nutrient</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">nutrient losses</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of white clover nitrogen fixation in grazed dairy pastures of south-western Victoria</field><field name="creator">Riffkin, Penelope A</field><field name="description">Australia is amongst the more efficient milk producers in the world.Milk production in the region of south-western Victoria relies mainly on rainfed white clover/perennial ryegrass pastures.As the demand for efficient and competitive milk production increases, the value of N2 fixation must be maximised. The objective of this thesis was to assess N2 fixation in grazed dairy pastures in south-western Victoria. Several tests and experiments were conducted and results noted. Studies revealed low white clover yields to be the major factor limiting N2 fixation in the region. For N2 fixation to have a significant impact on pasture quality and production, problems associated with legume persistence need to be addressed. Strategies may include the breeding of white clover cultivars with greater tolerance to water stress, improved winter production and increased competitiveness with companion species. Alternatively, the introduction of different legume species, better suited to the environment, may be appropriate. Where N2 fixation is unlikely to satisfy N demands, it may be necessary to introduce the strategic use of supplementary feeds or nitrogenous fertilisers.

The proposition argued is that the implementation of learner-centred approaches in a formal tertiary education setting will assist educators and learners to meet their needs. Further, the approaches will motivate participants in the learning process to be both self-responsible and self-directed learners. Participatory approaches were utilised to induce improvement in the Polytechnic's practices, student satisfaction and contributions to learning by the outside community. Participants included students, the Director, the Associate Director for Academic and Head of School. Information was also collected from outsiders. The outcomes from the project were: students were responsible for their own learning; staff were able to act as professional facilitators; and curriculum development.

Drawing on Walter Benjamin's philosophy of the image, the thesis sees the phenomenon of becoming unrecognisable as a particular practice of the image in which the face becomes a viable site for making death transmissible. It is argued that by paying attention to instances in media culture in which a face becomes unrecognisable, we can see how death is made visible as a dialectic between recognition and unrecognisability, appearance and disappearance. By examining the complexity of this particular form of dialectical image in a wide range of media - photography, television and film - the thesis shifts discussion away from questions of representation and faciality that feature so strongly in recent theorisations of the face.

These could be developed with biotechnological approaches to breeding such as the use of genetic engineering. a prerequisite to the use of this technique if the development of an efficient in vitro regeneration system. The objective of this study therefore, was to develop a tissue culture protocol suitable for the propagation and transformation of avocado. To do this, the effects of the preconditioning of mother plants, different explant sources, growth regulator pretreatments of explants and different compositions of the growth medium were examined. The results of these confirmed that avocado is typical of woody plants, as avocado tissues shows a decrease in morphogenetic capacity as they age, and the most juvenile explant, the embryonic shoot axis, showed the highest potential for shoot regeneration. Regrowth of explants after removal of the first flush of shoots resulted in the production of shoot bases in vitro. Shoot bases were most efficiently produced when embryonic axes were dissected transversely to the axis of growth. This study has resulted in the production of an efficient system for the production of multiple shoots from embryonic shoot tissues of avocado through the induction of shoot bases. This tissue culture system could be extended to the use of somatic tissues as a source of explants. If shoot bases can be established from such tissues, this will provide a means by which avocado can be clonally propagated and provides a system by which genetic transformation and other techniques of biotechnology can be applied to the production of new and superior cultivars.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">avocado</field><field name="subject">pests</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">tissue culture</field><field name="subject">biotechnology</field><field name="subject">propagation</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/3</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mandala dancers : a collaborative inquiry into the experiences of participants in a program of creative meditation : an investigation into a means of celebrating the wonderful in ordinary people</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Malcolm</field><field name="description">The thesis is the result of an inquiry into the experiences of a group of people engaged in a Buddhist inspired creative meditation program, the main practice of which is the recognition and honouring of the spiritual dimensions, the divinity of self and others. The study employed a heuristic process of examining 'inner world' experiences. The inquiry was collaborative in the sense that its findings were not those of one person alone, but were a compilation of the results of interactions within the group. The inquiry was based on the hypothesis that creative meditation can facilitate changes in a person's perception of self and the external world. The principal aim was to explore into that possibility and investigate the group members' thoughts and feelings as to the main function, significance and eventual outcome of their practice. The investigation seemed to show that for the core group participants there were changes in self-understanding involving more self-acceptance. Changes in attitudes to relationships of various kinds also took place and these also seemed to involve the development of a greater degree of acceptance. With some participants the association of the practice with favourable co-incidence was an interesting but inexplicable feature. For some there was an identification of mind sets which seemed to have a bearing on the quality of meditation experience and its outcomes. The title of the study refers to the manner in which the meditations were often generated. A mandala, a symbolic picture, was designed by each participant and the features of this were imagined to move, sometimes dancing, through the meditations which followed. The second sub-title refers to an integral feature of the practice which was an attempt to arouse a sense of the wonderful as a quality of the people who were imagined to appear in the meditations.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meditation</field><field name="subject">group experience</field><field name="subject">Buddhist</field><field name="subject">workshop</field><field name="subject">visualisation</field><field name="subject">spiritual</field><field name="subject">mind</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">dancing</field><field name="subject">self-concept</field><field name="subject">create</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The personal growth and career development of organisational change agents : a narrative study of the careers of experienced practitioners in an Australian setting</field><field name="creator">Lord, Kay Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study was initiated by the need to develop change agent skills in a group of consultants from a large government organisation facing major challenge from a competitive market. In order to develop a program, a group of mature and experienced change agents, with around 20 years experience in a variety of different organisations in each case, was asked, through the medium of an unstructured interview, to tell the story of their own growth and development. A model of 12 factors was developed, based on recent studies of leadership, the researcher's own career experience and an analysis of a well known practitioner's biography. This model was used to analyse the content of the interview material. The study found that there were a small number of factors which distinguished the development of this group from that of leaders who had been the subject of earlier studies. These were, firstly, the primary influence of the mother as role model. for both men and women. Secondly, the influence of early confrontations with established systems of power being employed in abusive ways, which developed a commitment to preserve the freedom of individuals to participate in decisions which affect their lives. Finally, a belief in the critical part ethics, integrity and the continual practice of learning for self-awareness, plays in maintaining a sustainable career as a change agent. The conclusions for a program of development for change agents are, firstly, that prospective participants should self assess their personal experiences from childhood, their attitudes to learning and the maintenance of an integrated self as an essential for mediating between stakeholder groups. Secondly, the influence of practical experience far outweighs that of schooling or academic studies. Thirdly, change agents employ what Bateson describes as type III learning, more than any particular theoretical approach, when designing organisational interventions. The study concludes that further research into the nature of the attachment bonds formed by change agents in childhood is needed to better understand the psychological dynamics which support excellent and sustainable practice.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">change agents</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal identity and the image-based culture of Catholicism</field><field name="creator">Prociv, Patricia Mary</field><field name="description">This research is documented in three volumes, and is the study of a series of three Doctoral exhibitions.

The study aimed to investigate the influence of high carbon dioxide concentrations on morphology/anatomy with physiological change among three closely related species possessing distinctly different photosynthetic pathways. The anatomy of the leaf was investigated using light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and graphics image analysis. A suitable schedule for fixation, dehydration and embedding of leaf specimens for both forms of microscopy was developed. The anatomy of the species investigated did not change qualitatively, but there were detectable changes in leaf thickness and tissue proportions of the epidermis, mesophyll and thickened tissues (sclerenchyma, bundle sheath, vascular elements) that differed with species. This study is also relevant to the investigation of the evolution of C4, although species, and the progression involved in plants with characteristics intermediate between those of C3 and C4 species. These intermediate species have been mainly characterized by CO2 exchange and biochemical analysis, but they also display anatomical characteristics in between those of C3 and C4 plants. The evolutionary progression of the C3 to C4 species remains unsolved, although current studies indicate that the evolutionary step was from the C3 plant to the C4. Thus the intermediate C3/C4 plants may not be intermediate in an evolutionary sense and they could be seen as a simple hybridization between a C3 plant and C4 plant. In most of the parameters measured the C3/C4 P. decipiens resembled either the C3 P. tricanthum or the C4 P. antidotale.

The intersection of two personal discoveries have been formative in my art practice. The first relates to the Indian Hindu and Buddhist concept of formlessness found in certain Tantric cosmogonies. This began, for me, an interest in the phenomenon of emptiness as an ontological awareness of how &#8220;art&#8221; or &#8220;creativity&#8221; happens. The second event was the hearing of a phrase, which I call a found phrase. The phrase, &#8220;working through condensation&#8221;, suggested a metaphoric tool for conceptualising my practice, through an analogous use of the process of condensation. I was struck by a similarity between my conception of the above found phrase and Tantric cosmogeny.

The participants were the nurses working in the ward and the nurse managers associated with the ward management and included the nurse unit manager and directors of nursing. Data for the case study were accessed from a number of sources for different purposes. The case study of the redesign of the model of nursing practice showed that change is a difficult process, which needs to involve all stakeholders. There are a number of implications for clinicians, managers and educators from this case study. Managers and clinicians must share an effective communication process during redesign and identify common outcomes. Clinicians need to be encouraged to work towards a vision of nursing practice through debate and education. Educators must be used to support the redesign process by preparing nurses to undertake change, provide information on models of nursing practice and change theory. Recommendations for future research include evaluations of the role of education in redesign and the effect of redesign from patient perspective.

Two key questions guided the exploration of this problem. How do the curriculum, teaching and assessment practices in teacher education assist and/or hinder WES student-teachers&#8217; retention? What problems, if any, do they have in becoming Australian teachers? These are examined from the perspective of the WES student-teachers themselves, their teacher educators and the WES school teachers involved in supervising them during their practicum. Facing acute teacher shortage in some subjects and some areas in Australia, this research project investigated issues affecting retention of WES student-teachers to meet the requirements of Australia&#8217;s ethnically diversified school communities. Methodologically, this study used an evidence-driven, conceptually informed, valuerational approach to education research. A case study design provided the basis for a cross-sectional, retrospective, non-experimental plan which was used to collect and analyse data. The subjects, teacher educators and WES student-teachers were contacted via the university teacher education program; while WES school supervising teachers were selected from schools where WES student-teachers did their practicum. Theoretically it explores the power and limitations of current theorisation of teacher shortages in terms of global cultural flows, specifically the trans-national mobility of knowledge workers. This thesis situates their experiences in the context of current and projected teacher shortages as well as testing current theorisation about global cultural flows of people in terms of the trans-national mobility of knowledge workers. This thesis argues that while teacher-educators recognise the difficulties in engaging educationally with WES student-teachers, and WES student teachers and their supervising teachers are aware of and able to identify other difficulties they confront becoming &#8220;Australian teachers&#8221;, the possibilities for making productive responses is constrained by cultural as much as economic factors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student teachers</field><field name="subject">Bologna process</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">supply and demand</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The right to dream</field><field name="creator">Moreton, Janelle R.</field><field name="description">Australian historicity is built on the absence of the Aboriginal subjective experience. The Right to Dream explores the temporal consequence of the imposition of the homogenous Aborigine, a social and political construction that effectively annihilated the right to exist as individual bodies within the earth space and its consequence on the well being of Indigenous peoples upon whom it was imposed. The Right to Dream is especially an attempt to understand my own subjective experience as an Aborigine in the land now known as Australia, and process that would in the words of Dr. Aileen Moreton-Robinson, propel me from being the known to the knower. The assimilation of the Indigenous body by western language has had devastating affects on the body as well as the land, and it is in this context that this thesis explores the notion of destruction of Indigenous peoples, their cultures and physical, spiritual, and emotional well being as being synonymous to the consequent destruction of their lands, marked by the loss of Indigenous languages throughout the country now known as Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">ethnic identity</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">English influence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhythm of the rivers : an ecosystem approach to child nutrition and health on the Amazon frontier</field><field name="creator">Murray, Tamsyn P. C.</field><field name="description">This research investigated the application of an ecosystem approach to the problem of child nutrition and health in the Ucayali region of the Peruvian Amazon. Poor health and widespread poverty in frontier communities has long been recognized as a significant issue. The annual flooding and extensive inundation of large areas of the floodplain challenges every aspect of human settlement. The overall goal of the thesis was to determine if, and to what extent, child nutrition and health is affected by seasonal ecosystem dynamics. The research investigated the interactions across three seasons- the dry season, the start of the rains, and the wet season. Based on the results of this study, the scarce resources of the government and communities can be more appropriately focused on those groups most in need, during their season of greatest need. Intervention strategies for food security will now concentrate efforts for the indigenous population during the height of floods, the period of greatest stress for these children; whereas efforts for mestizo children in the uplands and floodplain will be targeted during the onset of the rains. In contrast, health intervention will be most effective in the dry season in all populations, as this was when the incidence of diarrhoeal infections was highest, and water quality the poorest.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peru</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Amazon River region</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into factors impacting on large instrumental music programs in New South Wales public secondary schools, and directors' perceptions of program success</field><field name="creator">Hardy, Martin W.</field><field name="description">The study determines what factors and human input are placed into large instrumental music programs within New South Wales (Australia) public secondary schools and investigates the perceptions of instrumental directors as to what variables contribute to overall large instrumental music program success.

The thesis examines sociology of risk employing the work of both Beck and Giddens, although an emphasis will be placed on the work of Ulrich Beck. The three major themes that underpin the work of Beck, namely his risk society thesis, reflexive modernization and individualization are employed to explore some of the issues that concern the relationship between risk and society, the ramifications of this form of society on its inhabitants and specifically in relation to its impact on those experiencing pregnancy and childbirth. The Risk Society as an explanatory framework was empirically tested by conducting 45 interviews with women who had recently given birth from three separate birthing environments: private birth mothers, birth centre and home birth mothers. The argument is put forward that whilst previous research into the area of childbirth is clearly important in shedding a critical light upon childbirth practices, it does nevertheless neglect some important current social changes. In this respect, the application of Beck and Giddens work to the area of sociology of reproduction captures more adequately the ideological shift which this thesis examines. It is argued, through the scrutinizing gaze of the public, that the pregnant woman is the least able to escape the consequences of risk society where changed notions of health and responsibility have created a cultural acceptance of medical intervention of childbirth.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">natural childbirth</field><field name="subject">maternal health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School bullying : psychosocial determinants and effective intervention</field><field name="creator">Parada, Roberto H.</field><field name="description">Bullying incorporates a range of behaviours such as name-calling, physical assaults, social exclusion and verbal and physical intimidation. Engaging in and being the target of bullying is a significant risk factor for future criminal behaviour and poor mental health, making bullying a significant threat to an individual&#8217;s long-term psychological and personal development. The present investigation had three aims: (1) to create robust psychometric instruments to reliably measure bullying, bystander roles, and related constructs in adolescents: (2) to explicate the psychosocial determinants of bullying, identify characteristics which differentiate bullies and their targets, and investigate the role of other motivators in the incidence/maintenance of bullying and being bullied: and (3) to assess the effectiveness of a new whole-school anti-bullying intervention on reducing bullying incidents and enhancing pro-social attitudes and behaviour. Participants were a total of 5204 secondary school students (2277 males and 2929 females) in Years 7 to 11 and 256 teachers from six secondary non-government schools in NSW, Australia. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), reliability analysis and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) of factorial invariance were conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the instruments used in this study. Results demonstrated that the measures developed had sound psychometric properties. Boys were found to bully and be bullied more than girls across verbal, social and physical forms of bullying. The findings have important implications for theory, research and practice. This study has yielded several measures to further advance theory and research in bullying: the identification of a reciprocal effects model that explains the relation between psychological traits such as self-concept, bullying and being bullied advanced understandings about the casual effect of bullying on negative psychological outcomes, thus highlighting the importance of intervention: and an effective anti-bullying intervention for secondary school students.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bullying prevention</field><field name="subject">bullying in schools</field><field name="subject">school psychology</field><field name="subject">aggressiveness in children</field><field name="subject">victims</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and biochemical responses of avocado fruit to controlled atmosphere storage</field><field name="creator">Basuki, Eko</field><field name="description">The primary objective of the research was to study the physiological and biochemical changes in Hass avocado fruit stored in different combination of oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations at both 0 degrees and 5 degrees Centigrade (C), and to determine whether storage in controlled atmosphere (CA) can decrease the incidence of chilling injury (CI). A secondary objective was to identify possible correlations between CA, the incidence of CI, the activity of some ripening related enzymes and changes in proteins during ripening at 20 degrees C following storage at low temperatures. Fruit suffered no CI and ripened normally following CA storage for 3 weeks at both 0 degrees and 5 degrees C, then transferred to air for 6 days at 20 degrees C. CI symptoms did develop after CA storage for 6 and 9 weeks at 0 degrees C. Changes in proteins during ripening were analysed by 2D-PAGE. Some polypeptides were detected in unripe fruit but decreased with ripening. Polypeptides of 16.5, 25, 36 and 56 kD (kilo Dalton) were present early in ripening and their levels further increased during ripening. The appearance of three ripening related polypeptides with estimated molecular weights 80 kD (pI 3.6), 36 kD (pI 5.8) and 16.5 kD (pI 5.7) was observed in fruit at the climacteric stage. Three polypeptides with estimated molecular weights of 41 kD (pI7.8), 36 kD (pI 5.8) and 33 kD (pI 5.1) were found in air stored fruit but were not detected in fruit stored in CA. This research showed that CA did not ameliorate CI at 0 degrees C, instead storage at 0 degrees C caused a premature increase in ethylene production when the fruit were returned to air at 20 degrees C. In contrast, CA storage at 5 degrees C retarded ethylene production and ripening in fruit after it was returned to air at 20 degrees C.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">avocado</field><field name="subject">storage</field><field name="subject">cold storage</field><field name="subject">ripening</field><field name="subject">polypeptides</field><field name="subject">ethylene</field><field name="subject">carbon dioxide (CO2)</field><field name="subject">oxygen (O2)</field><field name="subject">controlled atmosphere (CA)</field><field name="subject">chilling injury (CI)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poets with blood on our tongues</field><field name="creator">Falzon, John</field><field name="description">The following areas of poetics and politics are engaged with in the writing practices that constitute this thesis : 1.The class context of poiesis (imaging and making). 2.The construction of the tropes : 'poet' and 'revolutionary'. 3.The ongoing process of making oneself as a poet. 4.The consciousness of oneself as a bodily (economic, political) movement in the oikos (house) and the polis (city), both of which are in the process of being unmade and made. 5.The dialectics of : destruction and creation, analysis (loosening the elements) and poiesis (assembling elements), naivete and terror, revolution and the state, the freely developing human and the crowd (as subject of becoming and binding), the necessity of telling and its impossibility, tightness and looseness, imperialism/post-coloniality, catholic christianity/post-theism, Marx and angels, social analysis and magical realism, presentation and marginalization, labour and capital, black and white, the making of poems and the making of a doctoral thesis, doctor and dictator, the epic and the fragmentary, the beginning and the end, the tongue and the blood. 6.The failure of the practices of Social Democracy and Stalinism in the face of the creativity and destructiveness of capital. 7.The unity/disjunction of the political and the passionate in creative practices. 8.Concrete historical conditions as the basis for poiesis.

It presents a case study that is based on actual events; but, because of the difficulties in reporting on the events in a large organisation without the possible influence of some staff, particularly senior management, it was decided to change the names of the organisation, the people and policies. The thesis is based on an examination of a number of policy initiatives that were 'quilted' together. Its focus is not on the contents of the policies or primarily on their economic success, but on the bureaucratic and stakeholder processes involved in their formulation. The purpose of the thesis is to provide a way of understanding events in organisations that are portrayed or categorised by research as policy formulation. Policy formulation is considered to be a core process in organisations, but it is still poorly understood or explained by current models, particularly those based on a rationalistic view of the world. Many of these models have their roots in economic theory and rationality, which promotes the idea that policy is a fundamental and almost inevitable part of organisation goal attainment. These ideas permeate and structure the theory and depiction of organisations and, hence, the way we understand the nature of the social actions and interactions supporting policy formulation. The thesis rejects the assertion that organisations move in a consistently calculated and logical direction based on goal setting and developing policies to meet objectives. An alternative view is proposed: that policy formulation must be understood within the phenomenon of an organisation where people enact a particular form of social reality. Under this model organisations are created and maintained by social processes that are continually executed by people. In this context, individuals and groups use processes of negotiation and power to manipulate and re-define the meanings attributed to problems and solutions to maintain a perception of consistent and coordinated change and goal attainment in policy formulation. This social practice is an attempt to define reality and maintain legitimacy for the policy changes. Thus, the emphasis is on social processes rather than outcomes, thereby focusing on the development and maintenance of perceptions of problems and solutions. This thesis analyses policy formulation as a distinctive kind of social practice using a case study of policy developments in a revenue office, as a means of explaining the basic nature of ongoing corporate life. The case study explores the way that core revenue office policies, proposed as 'logical' change, were formulated by individuals and groups who constantly used 'legitimising' management models and principles, agenda management, and bargaining and power processes to negotiate, influence, modify and manipulate the perceptions of change. The aim is to explain how policy options were generated in the 'Charisma period', to examine their origins and how they were acted upon, and to develop a set of summary concepts that might be used to understand policy development behaviours.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">taxation</field><field name="subject">fiscal policy</field><field name="subject">policy formulation</field><field name="subject">revenue office</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pollination biology of kiwifruit : influence of honey bees, Apis mellifera L, pollen parents and pistil structure</field><field name="creator">Howpage, Daya</field><field name="description">The importance of European honey bees in improving fruit set, yield and fruit weight of kiwifruit on the central east coast of Australia was investigated. Field investigations were carried out using different bee saturations and different types of male pollen parents. These investigations confirmed the importance of honey bees in kiwifruit fruit set, yield and fruit weight. However, the results suggested that increasing bee activity alone may not increase pollination of kiwifruit by honey bees. Many factors need to be understood before introducing bees into the orchard. Bees were more effective during the early part of the flowering period, and bee activity varied according to the sex of the vine, planting design and the time of day. The type of male pollen parents also influenced fruit size and quality. Flowers pollinated by different pollen parents were assessed for pollen tube growth and histochemical changes. The resulting fruit were also examined for weight and seed numbers. Honey bees play the major role in the size and yield of kiwifruit, but the design of male vines, their age and type of male pollen may also contribute. The kiwifruit pistil also possesses important features that can be considered as adaptations to insect pollination.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insect pollination</field><field name="subject">kiwifruit</field><field name="subject">honeybee</field><field name="subject">bee pollen</field><field name="subject">fruit weight</field><field name="subject">fruit yield</field><field name="subject">fruit set</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population management of Raphanus raphanistrum L.

(wild radish) is a widespread and economically problematic weed of winter crops including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in southern Australia. Management of the weed is achieved by a range of non-chemical and chemical techniques. Current management is failing to contain the weed, which is increasing in abundance and distribution. The characteristics of staggered recruitment, dormancy, rapid growth, competitive ability and high levels of seed production contribute to its persistence. The literature review concludes that weeds formed the basis for perpetuation of R. raphanistrum, a claim further investigated by simulation modeling. The effective management of R. raphanistrum should aim to achieve declining populations and this requires the integration of all factors that regulate seed production. Reducing seed production of R. raphanistrum in wheat can be achieved by applying herbicides at reproductive stages of development. This technique has been demonstrated to be an effective, safe and practical method of reducing seed production of R. raphanistrum in wheat. Reducing seed production of R. raphanistrum by herbicides applied at reproductive stages of development is a technique that can be incorporated into an integrated weed management program to improve control</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Raphanus raphanistrum L</field><field name="subject">wild radish</field><field name="subject">weed control</field><field name="subject">winter crops</field><field name="subject">Triticum aestivum L</field><field name="subject">herbicides</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public discourse personal reality: disablement and a re-search for caring culture</field><field name="creator">Clear, Mike</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the lives of carers of disabled people, and the research process itself within the collaborative framework of a support group. It used as its data sources an extensive review of the literature, interview transcripts and fieldnotes from carers, participants from the local service system, and the records of meetings and activities of the Group over 5 years. The study highlights the way public discourse on deinstitutionalisation has so captured our consciousness on care of disabled people that the personal reality of care in the family home has been effectively lost. It traces the disordering discourses of disablement and their link with constructions of caring. The personal reality of care and the isolating nature of this union of caring and disablement was the primary research focus. This may be characterised by social loss, and a lifestyle bound up with disablement which involves a search for a supportive or caring culture. The isolation and exclusion of carers occurs behind the screens of apparently caring institutions such as marriage, family, community and the service system. In the search for a caring cuture carers find their lives bound up with that of state and service systems which offer some hope of a supportive response. Instead they invariably find that the culture is an alien one. The research informed attempts of the Group to explore improved forms of caring culture, and more relevant public policy approaches.

Based on the proposition that music education could benefit from what it most appears to lack, a deep epistemology, the study first examines the knowledge gap as an epistemological omission in music curriculum and discourse, and then argues the case for retrieval of a logos epistemology to rectify the omission. The recovery of the meaning of the musical act, it is argued, is an ethical, biographical initiative taken up by the individual who senses the need to strive towards freedom of moral decision. Recovery consists in developing an epistemology specific to human utterance, namely, a logos epistemology. Since the logos is an original form-bestowing power whose sanctuary is the human being, it seeks and finds expression in uttered forms, and it is through fully conscious observation of one's own contribution to the emergence of these forms that one can find oneself as knower. It is significant that it is characteristic of the logos in the current era, however, that it is hidden from the (dual) perspective which humanity has taken up in its cognitive evolution. The condition of its recovery, then, is that it must be 'unconcealed' for it is obscured by its own forms, and consequently, by aesthetic and linguistic theory derived, not from efforts made towards enhanced musical experience, but inferred from the sense-perceptible elements of experience. It is argued that it is educationally responsible to cultivate the individual's latent epistemic resources, namely, self-observed, consciously directed intentionally, so that the meaning of the original experience of musical phenomena, tone and interval, can be raised to awareness, and musical culture renewed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">musical</field><field name="subject">human beings</field><field name="subject">utterances</field><field name="subject">latent</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">cognitive evolution</field><field name="subject">tone</field><field name="subject">interval</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Process-oriented dialogue : an inquiry into group work and conflict facilitation</field><field name="creator">Schuitevoerder, Ingrid Rose</field><field name="description">This is an exploration of process-oriented dialogue and how it is applied in group work and conflict facilitation.

As a result, Australia has been unable to develop a long-term sustainable domestic technological capability; with industry being dependent on government funding for its involvement in the nation's space plan. This thesis examines public policy aspects focussing on technology independence that is the building of competencies for the sustainable development of an industry. It compares national technological development by relating Australia's recent space-related successes and failures to those of other nations (especially selected Asian countries and Israel). The overarching research problem addressed within this thesis examined the Australian national space policy and strategy since 1984.It investigated why the Australian Space Industry Development Strategy was not a successful influence on the development of a long-term sustainable national technological base or on the establishment of a viable commercial space-related industry in Australia. The research included the development of a strategic multilevel planning system involving a network innovation model into a nation's space science and technology policy development. The outcomes of the research reported in the thesis are discussed. The level of technological capability and capacity is a direct, inversely related factor to an increase in the degree in technology dependency. Australia needs a change of philosophy by accepting the global challenge through defining and supporting, within a national strategic planning, a national space strategy that incorporates network innovation concepts: a concept that must involve a balanced supply (science) and demand (commercial) characteristics of an innovation network system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">space science</field><field name="subject">technology transfer</field><field name="subject">astronautics in Australia</field><field name="subject">technological innovations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategies for small business education and training: a case study in the independent supermarket industry in Australia</field><field name="creator">Eiseman, John</field><field name="description">The need to raise the skills and knowledge of both managers and staff in small business through improvement to education and training is the underpinning thematic concern of this research. Another concern is the appropriateness of action research as a process for research and development in education and training for small business. The independent supermarket industry in Australia provided the case study for this action research. The study sought to identify the barriers to participation in education and training programs and to develop strategies to overcome these barriers. Participation in education and training programs in the independent supermarket industry in Australia was found to be constrained by working conditions at store level, geographic location, negative attitudes of owners or principal managers towards education and formalised training and economic pressures on the industry. In this study the action research methodology provided the means to incrementally achieve a rich contextual understanding, to build researcher-client relationships, client receptivity to the research findings and credibility for both the researcher and the study. However, a key constraint to action research was the difficulty of gaining active participation from the client system. Another contribution of this is the documentation of the key issues and characteristics of independent supermarkets which have been poorly reported. The issues and characteristics identified for independent supermarkets, such as those arising from future uncertainity, family ownership, management style and attitude are compatible with those reported for small business generally. This research was guided by, and the results support, the proposition put forward by Gummesson that action research in a business environment is enhanced by the combining of the consultant and researcher roles.

Salmonella spp pose the greatest risk since they have the ability to proliferate in the absence of human and animal hosts. Composting processes eliminate salmonellae from sludge, but the opportunity for post-processing recontamination is considerable. This project examined the significance of post-processing recontamination of Salmonella broughton, introduced into composted sludge and N-Virosoil. In compost, inactivation rates of S. broughton showed an inverse relationship with simulated processing temperatures, with competitive exclusion by autocthonous compost flora thought to be the major mechanism of inhibition. S. broughton numbers were reduced to below the limits of detection after several weeks. S. broughton inactivation was also assessed in processed N-Virosoil and was found to be more immediate. It was concluded that both compost and N.Virosoil products have a low potential to support the regrowth of Salmonella spp.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sewage sludge</field><field name="subject">composting</field><field name="subject">N-Virosoil</field><field name="subject">salmonella regrowth</field><field name="subject">post-processing recontamination</field><field name="subject">Salmonella broughton</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public policy, the modern view and the training-investment decisions of the firm : is a minimalist approach to public sector intervention the answer?</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Lucie T.</field><field name="description">This thesis is an applied study of the response of a selected group of large construction companies in the Sydney Basin to the National Training Reform Agenda (NTRA). The thesis emanates from an interest in the modern view of public policy that suggests public sector intervention should 'augment rather than impede market forces' (Dollery, 1994:225). This view argues that too much public intervention has the potential to culminate in government failure because governments can be self-interested bureaucracies that are divorced from the interests and constraints of the market. To avoid such an outcome, this policy position advocates that governments should develop and implement public policy that encourages community, industry and individual participation in the policy agenda. This minimalist approach to public sector intervention, and the values it espouses, was investigated through research into the NTRA and the construction industry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Training Reform Agenda</field><field name="subject">construction industry</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">public sector</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-imagining apostasy</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Zina</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates the apostate: those who have given up the beliefs of their birth religion; and apostasy: the process of foregoing said religion. Beyond empirically derived determinants of religious defection often provided by conventional investigations in the sociology of religion, this thesis treats apostasy as a potential signifier of societal change. It attempts to see apostasy as a window for examining the location, of not only apostasy, but of socialisation, religion, and religiosity as constructs of modernity. It provides an investigation beyond a traditional analysis of apostasy as an aberration or problematic rupture in religious socialisation. Rather, apostasy is explored as a potential signifier of resistance to modernistic constructions of socialisation, religion and religiosity. It asks whether, commensurate with an emerging postmodern condition, there has been a transformation in Foucauldian 'technologies of the self' (1988:18) that allows more agency in the negotiation of the self, religion and religiosity. Chapter One introduces and contextualises the argument. It lays the theoretical framework for the thesis and situates the work in the literature. Chapter Two presents the methodology, reviews preliminary statistical findings, and offers the apostasy typology. Chapters Three and Four examine religious socialisation and epistemological orientation of religious disaffiliation. Chapter Five discusses post apostatic re-formations of the self and Chapter Six concludes the thesis with a discussion of the potential need for post apostatic religiosity.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">sociology of religion</field><field name="subject">apostasy</field><field name="subject">postmodernism</field><field name="subject">religiosity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the shelf life of macadamia nuts</field><field name="creator">Chitundu, Elizabeth Malama</field><field name="description">Shelf life studies of raw Macadamia integrifolia nuts were carried out at different storage temperatures, relative humidities and time. An accelerated shelf life test was conducted, and the influence of water activity on kernel texture was studied. The antioxidants naturally present were identified by the use of thin layer chromatography. Accelerated shelf life tests showed that hydrolytic rancidity followed apparent zero order kinetics within the water activity range of 0.3 to 0.5. Oxidative rancidity measured by peroxide value appeared to follow different orders of reaction at different temperatures. At two months of storage rancidity was detected at which the headspace concentration of hexanal was 0.39 ppm and a peroxide value of 0.37 meq/kg. Headspace gas chromatography was done to find a quick and effective method for measuring oxidative rancidity. The presence of natural antioxidants was verified to explain the shelf life of macadamia nuts. In textural study, correlations were found between subjective and objective measurements. The product became unacceptable organoleptically above water activity 0.415 when stored at 20 degrees C. This level was established as the critical water activity. There is a need to establish a water activity at which the consumer is likely to reject the product.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macadamia nuts</field><field name="subject">rancidity</field><field name="subject">storage of macadamia nuts</field><field name="subject">shelf life of macadamia nuts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiochemicals and social signalling in the wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus(L.)</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Richard Andrew</field><field name="description">The European rabbit lives in defined social groups of between two and about twenty individuals. There are distinct social hierarchies within each group. Rabbits are known to scent-mark their environment with secretions from several glands, and the secretion of the submandibular cutaneous gland is strongly correlated with social status. Dominant, male rabbits have a higher secretory activity of the gland, and show much more scent-marking behaviour than do any other individuals within the social group. This study was principally conducted at Hope Farm, Cattai National Park in New South Wales, Australia.The proteinaceous components of the secretion varied between individuals, but the protein profile of an individual did not change over time.It was found that dominant rabbits chin mark preferentially at the entrances to warrens, and at the boundaries of their territory.The work in this study provides new insights into the way that rabbit semiochemical messages work. The difference between the secretion of a subordinate and a dominant rabbit appears to be due to the presence or absence of one compound, 2-phenoxy ethanol. This compound, with known fixative properties, supports the idea that the only difference between dominant and subordinate secretions is whether or not they persist in the environment after marking. Such a mechanism for asserting dominance may be much more common in mammals than is apparent from the published literature</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European rabbit in Australia</field><field name="subject">social behaviour in rabbits</field><field name="subject">animal communication</field><field name="subject">pheromones</field><field name="subject">Hope Farm (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sense of being</field><field name="creator">Lange, Deborah</field><field name="description">This thesis emerged from the author&#8217;s quest to increase her personal and professional effectiveness, to become more congruent, and to be a better person in the world.

An important emphasis in these calls has been for attention to the history of the 'preactive curriculum' as represented, for example, in Syllabus documents. English has been a particular case in these arguments- a case which often revolves around defining the subject itself. Others have argued further that subject-specific history is usually centred in detailed local, historical studies of the recent past. In attempting to address these issues, this study sets out to answer the questions: 1/. How was Years 7-10 English defined from the early 1970s to the early 1990s in NSW? 2/. What was the relationship between the concepts 'English' and 'literacy' in NSW in the given period? The study focuses specifically on constructions of English in Syllabus documents, professional journals, textbooks and examinations. The particular methodology used to address the study questions is an in-depth study of two selected years during, viz. 1977 and 1992, accompanied by detailed discussion of contextual aspects of these years.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language in New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="subject">literacy in 20th century Australia</field><field name="subject">syllabus</field><field name="subject">written curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talking garbage: a study of local opposition, waste management and community consultation</field><field name="creator">Collins, Kathryn L</field><field name="description">Every attempt by the NSW State Government to site waste treatment and disposal facilities has been met by opposition from local communities. Increasing interest is being shown in community consultation and public participation in the decision-making processes concerning the siting of waste management technologies. This thesis examines the rationale behind, and potential of, community consultation through an examination of two case studies. The thesis concludes that the reasons and remedies for local opposition typically given by experts and regulatory authorities are flawed. The engineering concerns which have dominated approaches to choosing and siting waste management technologies are of little consequence to the way in which communities judge whether the facilities pose an acceptable societal risk. The issues of concern to communities include the legitimacy of the decision-making process, the relative fairness of the decision to site, and whether the institutions responsible for managing and operating the technologies are trustworthy. If waste management technologies rely on local acceptability for their siting, the approach taken to resolve the waste problem must include societal as well as engineering concerns in the design of courses of action to manage the risk.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waste disposal sites</field><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">community consultation</field><field name="subject">waste management technology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial distribution of phosphorus in the sediments of a constructed wetland receiving treated sewage effluent</field><field name="creator">Rowley, Maxine Joy</field><field name="description">The Byron Bay Sewage Treatment work consists of a conventional treatment system discharging into an 8 ha wetland. The wetland was constructed around the dune and swale remnants of a coastal beach ridge formation. The wetland design incorporated stands of broad leaf paperback, Melaleuca quinquenervia , in two distinct Sections, separated by, and each preceded by, open water Sections fringed by predominantly emergent macrophytes. Spatial and temporal patterns in sediment phosphorus concentrations were examined using sediment cores. Core consisted of three main sediment types - surface organic accumulation, pre-existing organic layers and sand. Results suggest that the design and management of wetland systems should be aimed at maximising the deposition of sediment (and associated phosphorus) and minimising subsequent phosphorus release from the sediment. This might be achieved through the removal of accumulated organic sediments to retain the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the system, consideration of wind direction during periods of high (floating) plant growth (as detritus may accumulate along the up-wind edges of the wetland), incorporation of deep zones to minimise sediment phosphorus release and the inclusion of stands of M. quinquenervia. Results highlight pitfalls in the prevailing approach to wetland design, which ignore the complex functions which occur in natural wetland systems. A more holistic approach incorporating a high diversity of ecozones in wetland design is proposed, in effect mimicking natural systems.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effluent</field><field name="subject">wetland</field><field name="subject">Byron Bay Sewage Treatment</field><field name="subject">ecozones</field><field name="subject">Melaleuca quinquenervia</field><field name="subject">dune</field><field name="subject">swale</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories from a community worker on the shifting sands of modernity</field><field name="creator">Richards, Sue</field><field name="description">This thesis presents post modern, feminist narratives written from the author&#8217;s experiences as a community development worker over a period of twenty years.

Early warning signs include limited joint mobility (LJM), soft tissue changes, high plantar pressure (HPP), high pressure time integrals (P/TI) and plantar callus. These abnormalities were examined in 216 young people with diabetes and 57 controls. The fingers, toes, ankle subtalar and first metatarsophalangeal joints shows reduced motion and the plantar aponeurosis was thicker in diabetic subjects. Skin thickness was the same for diabetic and control subjects. LJM in the feet was more common in males and older subjects. Subtalar and finger LJM was associated with early sensory nerve changes and finger LJM was associated with retinopathy and higher HbAtc. Thicker plantar aponeurosis was associated with male gander and larger feet. High peak pressure, high P/TI and callus were no more common in diabetic subjects than controls. However, high P/TI and callus were associated with early sensory nerve changes in young people with diabetes. Diabetic subjects with callus were significantly older than those without callus. Those with HPP had higher body mass index and less motion at the first MTP joints than those without HPP. Although plantar callus, HPP and high P/TI were no more common in young people with diabetes these abnormailities may be complicated by diabetes. Cushioning, custom orthoses or both in combination significantly reduced peak pressure and P/TI in diabetic subjects.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Type 1 diabetes mellitus</field><field name="subject">foot diseases</field><field name="subject">foot abnormalities</field><field name="subject">limited joint mobility</field><field name="subject">pressure time integrals</field><field name="subject">plantar pressure</field><field name="subject">plantar callus</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A SLDNF based formalization for updates and abduction</field><field name="creator">Lakkaraju, Sai Kiran</field><field name="description">Knowledge representation and inference are the backbone of artificial intelligence, and logic programming is one of the most widely used knowledge representation tools.

In dynamic domains where there are constant changes in knowledge, updating the knowledge base is crucial to keep it stable. This thesis investigates the issues in updating the knowledge base. Two types of logic program based updates are considered, simple fact based updates where the knowledge base is updated by a simple fact, and rule based updates where the knowledge base is updated by a rule. A SLDNF based procedural approach is proposed to implement such updates. This thesis also investigates the issues involved in simple fact based and rule based abduction, and it is observed that updates are closely related to abduction.

Oedipal Kings: Abandoned Boys and the Patriarchal Pattern provides an analysis of Sophocles' King Oedipus in support of my hypothesis that he is the mythic father of patriachal social structures and, therefore, that his life story might be viewed as a template for the formation of new patriachs. The chapter also includes a study of some contemporary eminent men in which I focus on the way early experiences of abandonment typically affect their adult behaviours. Silent Women presents Queen Jocasta as archetypal disempowered mother/ wife along with four contemporary women. The true self of each of the contemporary women was mute for many years as a result of negative or absent paternal experiences during adolescence. The Social Ecology of Mythic Thebes: A Study of Fate and Destiny in Patriarchal Culture extrapolates Jung's ideas about causality and teleology in individuals to the cultural setting of Oedipus's city state.

Buttons of epithelium were cultured in different culture media. The explants were monitored microscopically for their growth patterns and finally fixed and examined for cytokeratin, vimentin and actin. Different growth patterns were observed in the different media, indicating that different signalling patterns must be operating in these cells depending upon the media in which they were grown. To investigate the intracellular pathways controlling the different growth patterns, the protein phosphorylation of different cultures was investigated. The two proteins, p57 and p30, are strongly suggested to be associated with stratification of the epithelial cells. The possible involvement of the common serine kinase, PKC, in controlling the growth pattern of corneal epithelial cells were also investigated. The results suggested that an intracellular pathway involving PKC promotes the maturation and spread of the cells but is not involved in their stratification. These experiments taken together indicate that the different aspects of corneal epithelia cell growth are tightly controlled and may occur quite independently. Specific protein expression appears to be important for stratification, and phosphorylation of proteins by PKC appears to be involved with the maturation of epithelial cells from basal cells. It also indicates that the mature cells are capable of producing the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin which appears to have an important role in causing the spread as distinct from the stratification of the corneal epithelial cells.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corneal epithelial cells</field><field name="subject">intracellular signals</field><field name="subject">intracellular pathways</field><field name="subject">stratification</field><field name="subject">phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">PKC</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of Pb and Sr isotopes in human teeth as an indicator of Pacific Islander population dynamics</field><field name="creator">Jaric, Jovanka</field><field name="description">The study involved the investigation of ancient dental enamel derived from former inhabitants of Pacific Islands: a population whose movements were necessarily more restricted than their mainland counterparts. Lead and strontium isotope analysis of human teeth were undertaken using TIMS and MC-LAM-ICPMS. Exposure information was obtained from elemental concentrations of lead and strontium using LAM-ICPMS, GFAAS and ASV. Isotopic measurements of lead within the dental enamel of these individuals suggest that the dominant source of biogenic lead exposure in these and other pre-metallurgical societies derived from the local water supply. Data from these ancient populations are compared with measurements made on &#8216;moderns&#8217; based at Broken Hill, NSW, as well as from other UK-based post Iron Age populations. Results of this study indicate that the concentration of ancient lead within crystalline dental enamel in both ancient and modern populations can in certain circumstances be approximately the same, even when the degree of lead exposure is very high. The study proposes reasons for the discrepancies between these results and those obtained in previous studies, as well as discusses the implications of these analytical results for future studies in lead exposure in human populations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human remains</field><field name="subject">Oceania</field><field name="subject">lead</field><field name="subject">isotopes</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islanders</field><field name="subject">dental anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Software analytical tool for assessing cardiac blood flow parameters</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Hemant</field><field name="description">Introduction of Doppler ultrasound techniques into the Intensive Care setting has revolutionised the way haemodynamic status is monitored in the critically ill. However, in order to increase the usefulness of these techniques, the Doppler signal and its spectrum need to be further analysed in ways to facilitate a better clinical response. Extensive processing of the Doppler spectrum on Diagnostic ultrasound machines is limited by the real time performance considerations. It was therefore proposed that the spectral information from these systems be extracted off-line and full set of analytical tools be made available to evaluate this information. This was achieved by creating an integrated and modular software tool called Spectron, which was intended as an aid in the overall management of the patients. The modular nature of Spectron was intended to ensure that new analytical tools and techniques could be easily added and tested. The software provides its users with considerable latitude in choosing various data acquisition and analysis parameters to suit various clinical situations and patient requirements. Spectron was developed under the Windows environment to provide a user friendly interface and to address a range of programming problems such as memory management and the size of the colour palettes. Spectron is able to detect the maximal velocities and compute the mean and median velocities. Relative increases in maximal velocities in cardiac blood flows after the administration of inotropic drugs have been shown in the pilot studies that were conducted. Spectron is able to help in obtaining estimates of the aortic blood flows and in other applications such measuring vascular impedance. Stenotic blood flows can be detected by using the spectral broadening index and blood flow characteristics can be studied by using various blood flow indices.

Rainfall pattern and water level fluctuation; changes in runoff, erosion and soil properties under different land use types; relationships between soil properties as well as between rainfall and runoff-erosion; population pressure; and potential hazard areas were all analysed. Selected runoff and erosion models were evaluated for their suitability, and soil conservation strategies were developed, considering physical, demographic, socio-economic and political aspects. Results show that changes in inflow patterns are most likely due to changes in volumes of surface and subsurface runoff values; erosion in RKC is occurring at various levels depending on the land use types; there is a relationship between rainfall-runoff and erosion parameters; population pressure is above the critical limit and can be reduced by various methods; and RKC has a moderate to high erosion hazard.

The misapprehension of one will lead to misunderstandings in all of them. They are bound together by being part of the one God given secure universe. This allows Descartes to put forward the understanding of the universe as being one in which rational science was possible and indubitable certainty achievable. Because they are all organically related in the one meaningful system, the essential natures of these things which Descartes discovers flow into one another in their actual existence in the world. Accepting the picture of the universe as a rational place where certainty is possible, is part of what defines much of modernity as modernity. Since this is one way of ensuring certainty, modernity demands that a thing's essence should reflect its manner of existence. However this leads to modernity demanding of Descartes' philosophy that it reflect this same structure. Modernity then reads Descartes as trying to present such a picture, and consequently finds that Descartes' arguments do not work. Because Descartes' universe is God's universe, he is able to offer to humanity a very strong form of autonomy. But modernity prefers to have a less powerful form of autonomy which is independent of God, but which makes itself a servant to nature and the community of reason. This is a result of the price of entry into the rational universe through Descartes' method of doubt. As a consequence of modernity's reworking of Descartes' understanding of autonomy, and their demand that a thing's essence should exactly reflect its mode of existence, irreducible tensions develop in modernity. These are particularly obvious in the case of the relationship between science, reason and God, and between the mind and the body. This thesis addresses these tensions</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">philosophy and religion</field><field name="subject">Descartes</field><field name="subject">modernity</field><field name="subject">essence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of osmotic distillation in hollow fibre modul</field><field name="creator">Anh, Viet Bui</field><field name="description">Osmotic distillation is a process of removing water from an aqueous solution, driven by water vapour pressure gradient across a hydrophobic membrane. The process occurs at or below ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure. This research project investigates the osmotic distillation process in hollow fibre modules using hollow fibres PP375, PV375 and PV660 supplied by Memcor Australia. Operating conditions such as temperature, feed concentration and brine cross flow velocity, but not the feed cross flow velocity, were found to have significant effect on the flux. Models for heat and mass transfers were used to study the polarisation phenomena in osmotic distillation. Temperature and concentration profiles at the membrane surfaces due to polarisation were quantified. Scholfield and Ordinary Diffusion models for flux prediction based on the bulk conditions were developed and validated. Models for water activity and viscosity of aqueous glucose and calcium chloride solutions were also developed and validated in this work.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">osmosis</field><field name="subject">hydrophobic</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">feed concentration</field><field name="subject">brine</field><field name="subject">velocity</field><field name="subject">glucose</field><field name="subject">calcium chloride</field><field name="subject">heat</field><field name="subject">mass</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/4</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vortex : deferred sort last parallel graphics architecture</field><field name="creator">Santilli, Abram</field><field name="description">We have developed a new cluster parallel graphics architecture that improves upon prior cluster parallel graphics systems for high performance supergraphics &#8211; the Vortex deferred sort-last parallel graphics architecture based on global Zspace paradigm. The new architecture bypasses limitations of screen-space based parallelization paradigms, solves known Z-space parallelization inefficiencies and problems. Vortex addresses the lack of global Z buffer awareness between GPUs and prevents artifacts in globally order-dependent blending on multiple GPUs. The new paradigm allows for full 1-1 process-GPU coupling with minimal interprocess and inter-GPU communications. This allows for maximal input bandwidth, maximal GPU utilization levels, near optimal load balances, and improved efficiency when scaled to larger configurations. The Vortex architecture introduces the new deferred sort-blend approach for preventing visual artefacts in globally order-dependent fragment blends. All blend fragments are buffered in an external sort-blend subsystem until the end of rendering, when they are Z-culled, sorted and blended into the final frame. The new approach allows for efficient automatic order-independent blending and results in frames without any global blending artifacts The new architecture gives us the ability to fully harness the processing power of state of art GPUs, and at the same time it offers a much easier parallelization paradigm to programmers, compared to existing screen-space CPGS parallelization paradigms.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer graphics</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">real-time data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of Titanium(IV)complexes of mixed nitrogen and oxygen donor macrocycles and related schiff base ligands</field><field name="creator">Bowman, Gary Raymond</field><field name="description">This work investigated the use of large tetradentate mixed nitrogen and oxygen donor macrocycles as potential ligands for titanium(IV).These large ligands are capable of encapsulating the metal ion, thereby protecting it from reacting further.

Lactobacillus acidophilus 2401 and Bifidobacterium infantis 1912 were selected as strains able to survive in these conditions. These two strains were then offered further protection from the adverse conditions of food processing and storage by microencapsulation in a calcium alginate and starch gel matrix. Encapsulation in calcium alginate increases survival in yoghurt. In cheddar cheese the free L. acidophilus 2401 and B. infantis 1912 cells survived better than the encapsulated cells, probably due to the dense nature of the cheddar cheese matrix combined with the encapsulation restricting the flow of the nutrients and metabolites between the outside environment and the cells. In ice cream survival was high, probably due to the high fat and solids nature of the ice cream combined with the low storage temperature. The trial results of the laboratory scale production was consistent with the survival results for yoghurt and cheddar cheese. Incorporation of encapsulated probiotic bacteria into ice cream and cheddar cheese was acceptable by sensory standards and largely unnoticeable in comparison with the same foods without capsules. The capsules were visible and able to be felt on the tongue when eaten in yoghurt causing the product to be disliked by the panellists.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dairy products</field><field name="subject">microencapsulation</field><field name="subject">probiotic bacteria</field><field name="subject">dairy microbiology</field><field name="subject">Lactobacillus acidophilus</field><field name="subject">Bifidobacterium infantis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of atmosphere in international inter-firm relationships</field><field name="creator">Sutton-Brady, Catherine</field><field name="description">To date little empirical research has been undertaken into relationship atmosphere, yet the literature leads one to the conclusion that this is a key or central factor in developing the relationship between firms and in shaping the characteristics of that relationship over time.Given that the dimensions of atmosphere are only observable by the individual from a subjective standpoint, and that therefore emotion and subjective perception will inevitably intercede, this omission is startling to say the least.The aim of this study is to respond to this research gap and explore the nature and importance of perceptions of relationship atmosphere in business markets.In order for this exploration to be effective, a research methodology was designed to gather data, and three research questions were identified as having implications for the study of relationship atmosphere. The findings as reported in this thesis present a new view of relationship atmosphere and its role in inter-firm relationships. In view of the findings, a submariner analogy is presented to represent accordant and discordant perceptions of atmosphere in individual relationships.

This necessitates an examination of ontologies, concepts of the body, perceptive schemas and modes of consciousness that ultimately destabilise the assumed solidity and individuality of subject and object. Exchanges of subtle effects are continually taking place between viewer and object, and the space between subject and object is alive with interaction. Process philosophy is introduced as the basic ontological perspective underlying this reflection of subject-object relations. Three conceptualisations of subject-object interaction are considered: Western, Esoteric and Eastern, and three types of body-mind proposed by these investigations are discussed. The process and practice of cultivation required to activate intuition as a faculty able to perceive subtle effects are considered.

Several rice-based farming systems have been developed in various areas of the MD. Rice-shrimp integrated system in brackish areas is a special farming system developed in this delta. It is a profitable system and seems to be environmentally safe on the one hand without the use of pesticides. On the other hand, use of brackish water in this system may result in degradation of land, as some previous studies have found. To understand how this farming system works and to identify the external and internal factors influencing its sustainability, the project 'Sustainability of rice-shrimp farming system in a brackish area in the Mekong delta of Vietnam' was carried out in 1992-1993 by an interdisciplinary team of researchers from the University of Cantho and staff of local district Agricultural Office, representing different fields of sciences. The research methodology was the Farming Systems Research approach with modifications towards soft systems thinking, involving farmers into the research process. One main result of this study is an insight into the rice-shrimp farming system. It includes various physical, biological, technological, economical and sociological aspects of rice production prior to integration and in integrated farm, naturally supplied shrimp growing and giant shrimp rearing, upland crop production as well as off-farm and non-farm work of farm households. Sustainability of the system studied is assessed, in comparison with rice monoculture, through various criteria of the three view points productivity, environmental safety and socio-economic effectiveness. In terms of such points of view, rice-shrimp farming system is rated higher than rice monoculture system. Thus the integrated system so far is considered to be more sustainable than the others.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">integrated system</field><field name="subject">Mekong Delta</field><field name="subject">shrimp</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">brackish water</field><field name="subject">environmental safety</field><field name="subject">productivity</field><field name="subject">effectiveness</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">rice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systems management of Glenbrook Lagoon, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Keogh, Andrew James</field><field name="description">Glenbrook Lagoon, an 8 hectare lake receiving rainfall runoff from a residential catchment, is experiencing nutrient enrichment problems expressed as excessive aquatic plant presence. This study aims to assess the relative nutrient contribution of the total system compartments, including catchment loading, water column, aquatic plants and surface sediment. This information is utilised in the formulation of management strategies which may produce a sustainable nutrient reduction and general improvement in the system. The total nutrient content of the aquatic system was determined to be high in comparison with the present nutrient loading from the catchment. The ideal management case considers nutrient reduction of the surface sediment compartment firstly, followed by the aquatic plant community, with the water column and catchment influence as relatively low priority compartments. Various strategies for managing these are proposed. The total system benefits of the ideal management case are reductions in nutrients, aquatic plant biovolume and suspended solid loading. Unavoidable constraints placed upon the ideal management case include the excessive aquatic plant presence restricting accessability to the surface sediment for dredging. The resulting best management case requires aquatic plant eradication prior to sediment management, with the total system benefits associated with the ideal management case being retained.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrients in lagoons</field><field name="subject">Glenbrook Lagoon</field><field name="subject">catchment loading</field><field name="subject">water column</field><field name="subject">aquatic plants</field><field name="subject">surface sediment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition experiences following involvement in an elite athlete residential program</field><field name="creator">Burden, S.

A key finding is the significance of relationship within an atmosphere of openness and trust in enhancing critical reflection. A significant finding was the emergent distinction between 'critical reflection' and 'critical reflexivity' and a significant implication from investigating the process of reflexivity is that an important role for activism may be that of the 'relexive inquirer', the person who assists the deeper reflection, with no agenda other than to explore, to understand and to reveal deeper meanings.

M</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the derivation of similarity solutions for one-dimensional coupled systems of reaction - diffusion equations, a semi-linear system and a one-dimensional tripled system. The first area of research in this thesis involves a coupled system of diffusion equations for the existence of two distinct families of diffusion paths. Constructing one-parameter transformation groups preserving the invariance of this system of equations enables similarity solutions for this coupled system to be derived via the classical and non-classical procedures. This system of equation is the uncoupled in the hope of recovering further similarity solutions for the system. Once again, one-parameter groups leaving the uncoupled system invariant are obtained, enabling similarity solutions for the system to be elicited. A one-dimensional pattern formation in a model of burning forms the next component of this thesis. The primary focus of this area is the determination of similarity solutions for this reaction - diffusion system by means of one-parameter transformation group methods. Consequently, similarity solutions which are a generalisation of the solutions of the one-dimensional steady equations derived by Forbes are deduced. Attention in this thesis is then directed toward a semi-linear coupled system representing a predator - prey relationship. Two approaches to solving this system are made using the classical procedure, leading to one-parameter transformation groups which are instrumental in elicting the general similarity solution for this system. A triple system of equations representing a one-dimensional case of diffusion in the presence of three diffusion paths constitutes the next theme of this thesis. In association with the classical and non-classical procedures, the derivation of one-parameter transformation groups leaving this system invariant enables similarity solutions for this system to be deduced. The final strand of this thesis involves a one- dimensional case of the general linear system of coupled diffusion equations with cross-effects for which one-parameter transformation group methods are once more employed. The one-parameter groups constructed for this system prove instrumental in enabling the attainment of similarity solutions for this system to be accomplished</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diffusion equations</field><field name="subject">semi-linear</field><field name="subject">one-dimensional tripled system</field><field name="subject">coupled system</field><field name="subject">Forbes</field><field name="subject">classica</field><field name="subject">non-classical</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/43</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Best practice mine water management at a coal mining operation in the Blue Mountains</field><field name="creator">Cohen, Daniel</field><field name="description">This study covers the following aspects of mine water management at the Clarence Colliery, located at the headwaters of the Wollangambe River, N.S.W.

In this integration the inherent security flaws and associated problems of these technological advancements are also brought together under this web environment. These flaws, when exploited, could lead to system compromises of various kinds including stealing of security sensitive information, system take-over fabrication of fake electronic documents and illegal alteration to web sites contents. Therefore, the successful, prompt and appropriate responses of these complex web-based systems to security threats and breaches, such as in the cases of document tampering and misrepresentation from illegal users, are imperative in promoting the user's willingness and confidence when interacting with these systems. Accordingly, this has become one of the major concerns in development, management and operation of web-based systems. This thesis also studies the authentication of dynamic web contents through the application of a one-time digital signature.

Construction of sense of place in the era of globalisation : a case study</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Sarah Frances</field><field name="description">How are people in a global society reconstructing their sense of place? This key question is addressed in this thesis. Australian society has emerged from the period of industrialisation and entered the period of globalisation, a modern to a postmodern world. Sense of place is a vital source of both individual and cultural identity and security, a point of departure from which we orient ourselves in the world. The use of a place, its terrain (landscape), connectedness to that place and its inherent meaning are identified here as the 4 key elements in the construction of a sense of place. The case study approach adopted in this thesis examines a former industrial site in Pyrmont currently being redeveloped as a waterfront residential community, known as Jacksons Landing. The site is reviewed at the moment in time it transcends the industrial era and enters the global era. The mixture of research methods examining the transition includes observation; key informant interviews; structured interviews; and document analysis. The study document the shift of the site from 'space' to 'place' through personal presence and association. It catches a glimpse of how individual experience of place is formed from a unique moment in space-time, which is interlinked with memories, emotions and identity. The findings indicate that communities of the future, in the era of globalisation, will be markedly different to those of the industrial era. Results suggest lifestyle and economic factors will shape future communities, which have the potential to be gated and homogenous, representing a microcosm of segmentation and secularisation. Security, income and occupation will be increasingly valued, forming the basis of identity and the shaping of place.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">Jacksons Landing</field><field name="subject">industrialisation</field><field name="subject">connectedness</field><field name="subject">regeneration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the fences : co-ordinating individual action in rural resource management through Landcare : a case study of managing non-point source discharges to water in Waikato, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ritchie, Helen</field><field name="description">This study addresses the central problem of how the behaviour of individuals may be co-ordinated to manage collective natural resources, and in particular, to what degree this can be achieved through voluntary, community based means under a free market policy regime. This question was explored by researching how local groups known as Landcare, or Care groups, are managing waterways in Waikato, New Zealand, and specifically by examining their effectiveness in controlling non-point source contaminants to water originating from agricultural land.An action research approach was used to investigate research questions regarding what motivates actors to support activity to enhance water quality, the effectiveness of such activity in addressing non-point source discharges to water, and the equity issues which are associated with environmental management through Landcare. This study suggests that neo-liberal philosophies of governance, while favouring voluntary resource management, disregard the conditions which, in practice, underpin effective and equitable examples of this type of activity. A call is therefore made for a more active role for government, in directly supporting local action, in compensating for the impacts of free-market policies on natural resource use, and in facilitating the representation of the diversity of views in environmental management. Action research, participatory planning, and other learning based and communicative processes could be usefully employed to guide and inform such interventions</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation of natural resources</field><field name="subject">New Zealand waterways</field><field name="subject">water pollution prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining the green consumer : a legitimisation of the process of marketing products with lower environmental impacts</field><field name="creator">Said, David Michael</field><field name="description">Everything manufactured has an impact on the environment, either by consuming unrenewable resources as raw materials, or consuming energy, or adding excess nutrients to soils and waterways, or generating greenhouse gasses, wastes or pollutants. Many environmental critics believe that the most effective way to reduce this damage is to regulate to force manufacturers to produce and distribute goods with lower environmental impacts. Others believe that consumers should be educated to demand these improvements from manufacturers. The author of this thesis believes the most effective way to persuade the private sector to reduce the environmental impacts of its products would be to convince them that this would be profitable. At this point in time, most Australian manufacturers do not believe this to be the case, otherwise there would be many more green products in the marketplace. Many marketers have a negative attitude to green marketing, while others who would like to investigate the potential of the green market lack the data to do so. The original research for this thesis takes the form of a commercial market segmentation study designed to analyse the green market and provide answers to the following questions : Which segment or segments of the Australian population are actual or potential green consumers? What are their motivations, attitudes and buying habits? What new products would they welcome in the future? The findings of the research are that at least 50 percent of the Australian market has made considerable behavioural adjustments for environmental reasons and would welcome greener products. Marketers can therefore only ignore the green market at the risk of ignoring the needs and wants of 50 percent of the population. Thus, the original research provides a map of the Australian Green Market which will legitimise the corporate decision, develop and promote greener products</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">green products</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">consumers</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">profit</field><field name="subject">production</field><field name="subject">segmentation</field><field name="subject">attitude</field><field name="subject">brand</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/45</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of individual koalas: microsatellite analysis of faecal DNA</field><field name="creator">Hey, Grace Valasi</field><field name="description">Current studies of koalas in the wild mainly rely on information gathered by traditional field methods, such as community sightings, spotlighting, radiotracking, animal trappings, ear tagging and faecal pellet incidence. Collection of faeces is potentially the most reliable source of non-invasively obtaining DNA samples, which can be used to identify specific individuals. This thesis demonstrated a simple, rapid and reproducible method of extracting DNA from Koala faecal pellets using a commercially available DNA extraction kit, shows the maximum age of pellets from which DNA can be reliably extracted and defines the conditions required for the long term storage of pellets before DNA extraction is carried out. Mitochondrial DNA PCR analysis provided a simple and rapid indication of the success of both the faecal DNA extraction and pellet collection process. The faecal DNA was successfully used for microsatellite analysis and the subsequent genetic profiling of individuals from within the Campbelltown Koala population. The study paves the way for the analysis of microsatellite loci in koala faecal pellet DAN to study populations, which are too sparsely distributed to allow the capture of individual koalas</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">koalas</field><field name="subject">faecal DNA</field><field name="subject">microsatellite loci</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ideology as commodity : industry of a theocracy and production of famines in Ethiopia</field><field name="creator">Wako Adi, Liban</field><field name="description">This work introduces an alternative paradigm that claims that the primary industry of imperial Ethiopia has been (and still is) one that has evolved around the Abyssinian national mission vis-a-vis the populations it rules from a point of conquest. Abyssinia, like Catholic Spain in the Americas, carried out a series of 'civilising' missions (Christianising), that has spanned centuries to modern times. Around a theocratic mission evolved a service type industry, the author calls theo-industry. On that basis, the work demonstrates how well-known categories of 'land-tenure', namely, the gult/goolt, the gultenya/gooltenya, the rist, the ristenya, the gabbar and related others are categories of a fiscal system of theo-industry, not of an agrarian system or agrarian industry. It is argued how these rather complex categories belong in the realm of wages and pensions of a service-type industry, not in those of agriculture. By failing to establish the functional link between agriculture and the national mission of the rulers, the scholars of Ethiopian studies have so far been unable to identify this 'elusive' but all-pervasive primary industry of Ethiopia. That in turn, the author argues, has had a rub-off effect in hindering a clear and comprehensive understanding of issues such as poverty and famine. The central topic of this work is the 'identification' of this 'elusive' industry. The study of its evolution, set in historical grounds, of its dynamics and the intricate maze of multi-natured relations is attempted. On this basis, the option of creating an independent (from theo-industry), and more importantly, renewable agricultural industry is proposed as the key to tackling chronic levels of poverty and famine in Ethiopia</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dependent industry</field><field name="subject">poverty, Ethopia</field><field name="subject">theocratic mission</field><field name="subject">agrarian system</field><field name="subject">wealth creation</field><field name="subject">gibbir</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imag(in)ing women as homeless : re/tracing socially concerned photography</field><field name="creator">Crinall, Karen Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis is primarily concerned with the meanings that are produced when women become visible amongst the homeless through photographic representations. While there have always been homeless women, unlike their male counterparts, they have remained largely invisible to the public and government policy makers.Social documentary photography has acted as one of the main avenues through which homeless women have, literally, been rendered visible. Driven by, and implicated in complex sociocultural and political circumstances, socially concerned photographs draw on the real and the fictional to generate truth/power effects.Thus, the thesis re/traces the representation of homeless women in a range of visual texts and ask how this construct has been discursively produced and deployed. In order to explore how socially concerned photography has contributed to, and made use of the idea of homeless, or destitute woman, examples are drawn from a range of photographic genres. These include traditional social documentary, public collections of photographs, photojournalism and publicity materials.The selected images, the circumstances out of which they emerge, and those in which they are read, are interrogated along, and with the consideration of the interconnections between axes of gender, genre, race, class and power. The inquiry does not aim to establish a unitary source, or coherent trajectory of the visual representation of the homeless woman, because origins, particularly of ideas, are always contestable. Rather, a primary aim is to expand the field of possibilities for the visual portrayal of women's experiences of homelessness.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homeless women</field><field name="subject">photography of women</field><field name="subject">poverty</field><field name="subject">documentary photography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can an illusionary object such as a painting express the essence of change in values of the artist and their society?</field><field name="creator">Cliffe, Gregory Laurence</field><field name="description">The initial intention of this thesis was to amalgamate two distinct tendencies that evolved in the author's art work over the period of twenty-four years. The illusionary and corporeal qualities of his painting and sculpture had become amalgamated with social concerns, which emerged from his installation and performance work between 1975 and 1985. The moment the artist makes a gesture on a painting surface is a culmination of memory, the immaterial and the corporeal. That moment expresses his judgement about himself, and the world in illusionary form. By bringing together of the self and one's worldview, the corporeal and the immaterial, the past and present, the artist is provided with the authority to make judgements and to change themselves and their surrounding community, as well as gaining insights into changes in values in his community and family.

An initial study of two groups was used. The experimental group consisted of 24 gifted and talented students in a homogenous class of gifted and talented students in a primary school in Metropolitan area of Sydney. The group consisted of 13 boys and 11 girls aged between 9-12 years. The comparison group was matched for age, gender and IQ and attended mixed ability classes in four local primary schools. Each group completed a Self Description Questionnaire at the start of the school year and six months later. The SDQ was administered 12 months later to both groups. The academic self-concept of the experimental group was diminished after six months and remained diminished for the 12 month follow-up study. There was no difference in non-academic self-concept between the experimental and comparison groups. Study 2 was a qualitative study of each parent&#8217;s response to their child&#8217;s experience in the gifted and talented class by asking them for their perception of the special class placement on their child using an open ended structured interview. Study 3 analysed data from a wider group of gifted and talented students in a Metropolitan area of Sydney, on an academic self-concept and motivation, reading and mathematics achievement. From this analysis the interrelationship of motivation, academic self-concept and achievement was observed and conclusions drawn for best practice for gifted and talented students.

Changing dietary patterns from traditional eating patterns to those typical of a western lifestyle has been associated with increased risk of disease. Furthermore, new food use patterns develop through the rejection of traditional and the acceptance of culturally new food habits. The purpose of this study is to identify the food habits and meal patterns of Koreans living in Australia, and any relationship between length of residence and change in eating habits. The method used for this research was a self reported questionnaire, administered in an interview and 3 day food records. One hundred adults living in the Korean community in Sydney were surveyed. The collected data were coded and analysed by using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 10. Descriptive analyses, for example mean and standard deviation, were carried out to determine the respondents&#8217; attitudes toward food habits. The personal information data were also analysed by SPSS using frequency tables to describe the study sample. The results indicated that food habits had no significant differences dependent upon length of residence. Food habits were slightly affected by availability of income, occupation and religious beliefs. Food consumption frequency showed increased meat and dairy products.

The approach, however, differs from previous studies in that it avoids utilising direct property data because of the inherent valuation-smoothing problems.Instead, it develops unique specialised indices for LPTs by size and BV/MV ratios. The analyses are conducted in four different ways. Amongst other findings, it is suggested that the two well known stock market effects, namely size and BV/MV effects, are significant in LPT returns. As such, by way of inference, it is suggested that property effects in LPT returns are subsumed under the effects of these two factors. The findings support the hybrid-asset hypothesis for LPTs; that is, LPTs are an asset class of its own, sharing to an extent, the characteristics of both shares and property direct.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">listed property trusts Australia</field><field name="subject">real estate investment</field><field name="subject">stocks</field><field name="subject">property investment in Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fur, pixels, loved ones and other transients</field><field name="creator">Donat, Melanie</field><field name="description">Fur, Pixels, Loved Ones and Other Transients is a paper discussing my practice from 2000 to 2003.

This is achieved through an exploration of current literature, policy and legal documents, and from the point of view of a sample of ADF women. The purpose of this thesis is to determine whether constructions of gender devalue, exclude and therefore oppress women in the ADF and to determine whether constructions of gender legitimise the subordinate position of female personnel within the ADF. The study locates the &#8216;voices&#8217;, the experiences, and opinions of a group of female ADF personnel in order to hear from the &#8216;central&#8217; players. The thesis contributes to current debates by: providing a platform for female members of the ADF to relate their experiences and opinions, thereby, giving a voluntary voice to women who are often not heard from in the debates; providing a feminist perspective -which in the Australian context is scant, as Australian feminisms have been reluctant to approach this controversial area; providing a critical perspective that is complementary to in-house research, through conducting the research from a position outside the ADF. The aims of the research are to explore the culture of the ADF, with the purpose of illustrating the underlying causes of barriers to full integration. It aims to understand where unequal treatment arises from, how inequity manifests, how this impacts on women, and how ADF resources are ultimately misused by the excluding of women from certain employments. Coming from a pacifist position I originally wanted to know why women would want to join the ADF, this question was easily answered through the beginning phases of the research. Through the research fieldwork I was led in the direction of focusing on the gendered nature of Defence culture. Government and ADF policy on combat exclusions I found to be a barrier to integration that impact upon career progression in the ADF. The research further revealed a disturbing realisation that Australian women continue to be denied full citizenship rights and responsibilities due to the inequities of restrictions on military service. The research led to the finding that women are excluded from roles in the ADF based on the mythology that women&#8217;s service is inferior to that of males. Issues presented in the arguments for cohesion, physical strength, and protectionism are military myths that seek to continue to exclude from positions of leadership, prestige and power in the ADF. Women&#8217;s current and potential roles in combat and peacekeeping are presented in the thesis as ultimate case studies revealing how women are denied equal employment rights in the ADF</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Defence Force</field><field name="subject">Sex discrimination against women</field><field name="subject">Women and Defence Force</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geo-chemical budget models of the Penrith Lakes Scheme</field><field name="creator">Keogh, Andrew James</field><field name="description">The Penrith Lakes Scheme is a series of inter-connected lakes, produced by the rehabilitation of a sand and gravel quarry, for water quality treatment and recreational uses.

In attempt to redress this situation the initial aim of this study is to present an up-to-date list and description of secondary chromium minerals. It has long been recognised that secondary chromium mineralisation, in the form of chromates and compound chromates, occurs as a minor component of total secondary mineralisation in oxidised zones of some sulphide ore bodies. A thermochemical approach is adopted and a model to describe the geochemistry of chromium in aqueous solution as applied to mineral formation in the supergene environment and its transport in near surface waters is established. The model confirms that species distribution of chromium in aqueous solution is quite pH dependent and that at concentrations appropriate to those experienced in Nature, chromate is the only important species in basic solutions under highly oxidising conditions</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chromium research</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women transforming the workplace : collaborative inquiry into integrity in action</field><field name="creator">Hall, Virginia Kaufman</field><field name="description">This collaborative research is an account of the recent lived experience of twelve women who bring about transformations in their own workplaces.

This thesis investigates the 'Wilderness Knot&#8217; &#8211; the confusion and tangled meanings around &#8216;wilderness&#8217;. In the literature this &#8216;knot&#8217; is comprised of at least five strands; philosophical, political, cultural, justice and exploitation. Normally people focus only on the last of these strands, its economic exploitation. The methodology is qualitative, involving participatory action research (PAR) and hermeneutic phenomenology. The PAR was done with the Blue Mountains Wilderness Network near Sydney, which investigated the confusion around &#8216;wilderness&#8217;, and sought to reduce this by entering into dialogue with supporters, critics and community members interested in wilderness issues, notably the local Aboriginal Traditional Owners (TOs). Eleven in-depth interviews with scholars (including critics) of wilderness were carried out to feed into this PAR. The hermeneutic phenomenology made use of the wilderness journals of five of the Network, and sought to gain a deeper understanding of the experience of wilderness itself, and also the lived experience of encountering the wilderness knot. The PAR provided many insights into the knot, especially regarding the need for dialogue to reduce the confusion. It demonstrated the delicacy needed to gain meaningful dialogue over an issue which raises real passions about social and environmental justice. It took three years to develop meaningful dialogue between TOs and conservationists. The spectra of issues entangled in &#8216;the land&#8217; and &#8216;wilderness&#8217; are presented textually and diagrammatically, as are the ways forward to untangle meanings and reduce confusion. The political naivety of academia is discussed in regard to &#8216;wilderness as lanai&#8217; (considering increasing threats). There is a need for greater rigour in identifying which meaning of &#8216;wilderness&#8217; is actually being referred to. There is also merit in promoting recognition that &#8216;wilderness&#8217; is in fact a tribute to past indigenous land practices, not a disregard of indigenous history. The idea of shared &#8216;custodianship&#8217; or stewardship is suggested as a way forward. The wilderness knot can indeed be loosened, as this thesis demonstrates. However, it will be an ongoing project for all those involved. The art to keeping &#8216;wilderness as lanai&#8217; is not just &#8216;eternal vigilance&#8217; it is an eternal ongoing dialogue about its meaning and values.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wilderness areas</field><field name="subject">philosophy of nature</field><field name="subject">nature</field><field name="subject">wilderness area users</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of the rice leafroller Cnaphalocrocis (Marasmia) exigua (Butler) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae: Pauristinae) in Fiji</field><field name="creator">Singh, Satya Ram</field><field name="description">The rice leafroller Cnaphalocrocis exigua (Butler) in the only species of the rice leaf folder/roller complex in Fiji. It is one of the major rice pests in the country, its pest status being exacerbrated by the cultivation of high-yielding varieties with minimal pest resistance. Detailed studies on the biology of the moth, in particular on the development, emergence, mating and flight behaviour, effect of adult nutrition on fecundity, egg hatchability and longevity, effect of larval nutrition on larval survival, pupation, pupal weight, pupal eclosion, and fecundity, egg hatchability and longevity of resultant adults, parasitism, and population ecology of C. exigua were carried out in Fiji from 1985 to 1987, and from June to August 1990. This study showed that there are several parasitoids of C. exigua in Fiji, and of those the egg and larval parasitoids Trichogramma sp. and Trathala flavo-orbitalis (Cameron) respectively are significant biotic mortality factors. Their impact as natural suppressors of C. exigua in fields of high yielding rice varieties was, however, inadequate to prevent C. exigua reaching damaging levels. Since C. exigua responds strongly to rice varietal differences, plant nitrogen status, and seasonal factors, is suspected to utilise pheromones during mating, and has numerous biocontrol agents in South East Asia and the Philippines, it appears to be an excellent candidate for an integrated pest management (IPM) program in Fiji. Before IPM strategies can be formulated, however, further investigations on rice varietal resistance, exploitation of exotic parasitoids and pathogens, and detailed studies on the possible presence of sex pheromones need to be conducted.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parasitoids</field><field name="subject">pests</field><field name="subject">larvae</field><field name="subject">pheromones</field><field name="subject">pathogens</field><field name="subject">rice</field><field name="subject">high yielding</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Both ways and beyond : in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health worker education</field><field name="creator">Grootjans, John</field><field name="description">During 1987 my essential beliefs about the nature of the world were challenged by a chance event which led to my arrival in Arnhemland. Working with Aboriginal people allowed me to see first hand the failings of Western ideas in Aboriginal education and health. This is how a 12 year collaboration with Aboriginal people began. The aim was to search for answers to the question, 'Why so many ideas that had been successfully used in the Western world, fail to meet the needs of aboriginal people? My experiences prior to 1995 had led me to believe that Both Ways, an education pedagogy developed in teacher education, was the best approach for empowering Aboriginal Health Workers. I believed Both Ways gave Aboriginal Health Workers a means to develop solutions to aboriginal health issues which valued and respected their aboriginal knowledge. I needed to describe and evaluate the practice of both ways with Aboriginal Health workers for the purpose of proving the benefit of this pedagogy for other educators in this field. This thesis describes how I came to think Both Ways was a good idea; how I defined Both ways; and how I put it into practice. It also provides a description of the issues raised in my critique of Both Ways and in my attempts to provide answers to these issues. Several years of collecting data, including records from action research group discussions, participant observation, interviews with peers and students, and formal evaluations left me with many concerns about Both Ways.

The thesis examines 3 propositions : that managers are unaware of the need to link performance measures to strategic goals and that, as a consequence, performance measures do not change to reflect a change in strategic direction; that the link between the performance measurement system and organizational goals is weak because the organization's structure inhibits a coordinated approach towards achieving strategic objectives through the use of performance measures; and, that the dynamic environment in which firms operate serves to disassociate strategic objectives from the performance management system, and the lack of managerial attention to the link between the two will result, over time, in a set of performance measures which provide insufficient, late or wrong information. The research indicated that awareness of the need to link performance measures with strategy rose with managerial responsibility; that the wider the scope of the performance measurement system, the better it would be at accommodating and monitoring changes in strategic direction; that, where the performance management system covered a broad range of activities it could be better used by managers to coordinate and integrate those activities; that managers' perceptions of the reliability, validity and timeliness of the information provided by their performance management system were positively related to the level of ownership of the system; and, in a dynamic business environment, the more comprehensive the information provided by the performance management system, the less likely the organisation would respond inappropriately to external factors.

Three complementary research methods have been used: a survey, an Internet dialogue and a co-operative inquiry of facilitators, managers and academics. The survey revealed that facilitators have diverse and sometimes contradictory approaches to their organisational work, co-operative processes are not easy to sustain within hierarchical organisations, and that facilitator ethics need clarification. The development of a Statement of Values and Code of Ethics by the International Association of Facilitators formed the content for the Internet dialogue part of this research. The co-operative inquiry highlighted that sustainable co-operation depends on embodied whole people connecting with love and compassion, and with the commitment and courage to speak their own truth and deeply engage with the collective wisdom of the group. It is shown that co-operative organisational forms, methods, processes, values and ethics are only part of what is needed to support co-operative endeavour. Underpinning all of these are ways of being that are learnt through modelling and mutually supportive interactions between persons in relationship. These ways of being need to be transmitted along with conceptual frameworks, processes and methods for &#8216;co-operacy&#8217; to be sustainable in groups and organisations</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group relations training</field><field name="subject">group facilitation</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Giftedness in early childhood : the search for complexity and connection</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Catherine Anne</field><field name="description">This portfolio documents an investigation of the nature of giftedness during the early childhood period of birth to eight years. It provides an in-depth exploration of a number of developmental domains including social, emotional, spiritual and cognitive development. Aspects of play and learning for young gifted children are also investigated. The use of both child and parent voices provide insight to the realities of the lived experience of being young and gifted. The insights that emerged from the research are subsequently used to challenge aspects of early childhood pedagogy frequently evident within western approaches to early childhood education such as the developmentalist discourse traditionally used to inform early childhood policy and practice. The findings of the study suggest that to ensure responsive education for young gifted children early childhood educators need to reconceptualise the child and the relationship between the three protagonists of child, family and educator. Collaboration between the three protagonists can facilitate the provision of opportunities for in-depth investigation and abstraction within early childhood curricular that can empower young gifted children in their search for complexity and connection during the early childhood years.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">toddlers</field><field name="subject">preschool education</field><field name="subject">identification of gifted children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The great ornamentals : new vice-regal women and their imperial work 1884-1914</field><field name="creator">Andrews, Amanda R</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the evolution and emergence of the new-vice regal woman during a high point of the British Empire. The social, political and economic forces of the age, which transformed British society, presented different challenges and responsibilities for all women, not least those of the upper-class. Aristocratic women responded to these challenges in a distinctive manner when accompanying their husbands to the colonies and dominions as vice-regal consorts. In the last years of Queen Victoria&#8217;s reign a unique link was established between the monarchy and her female representatives throughout the Empire. The concept of the new vice-regal woman during the period 1884-1914 was explored through three case studies. The imperial stores of Lady Hariot Dufferin (1843-1936), Lady Ishbel Aberdeen (1857-1939), and Lady Rachel Dudley (c.1867-1920), establishes both the existence and importance of a new breed of vice-regal woman, one who was a modern, dynamic and pro-active imperialist. From 1884-1914 these three new vice-regal women pushed established boundaries and broke new ground. As a result, during their vice-regal lives, Ladies Dufferin, Aberdeen and Dudley initiated far reaching organisations in India, Ireland, Canada and</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women social reformers</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">20th century Great Britain</field><field name="subject">vice regal women</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and extrusion of Metroxylon sago starch</field><field name="creator">Ansharullah</field><field name="description">The study presented here was firstly to investigate the physiochemical properties of native sago starch (obtained from Metroxylon sp. and designated as sago INA), in comparison with those of Metroxylon sago starch obtained from a different source, sago starch derived from Arenga sp. palms, wheat, corn, and tapioca starches. The properties analysed were chemical composition, total starch content, apparent amylose content, pasting properties, endothermic thermal behaviour, starch paste clarity, freeze-thaw stability, hardness of gel, and microscopic structure of the granules. The results obtained indicated that sago INA starch sample contained less fat and protein, compared to cereal starches. The sago starch sample had larger sized granules and had a more transparent paste. The gels of the starch were harder, and showed a relatively better stability to freeze-thaw treatment. The other part of the study was extrusion of sago INA starch both in the absence and presence of enzyme by utilising a response surface design. In the absence of the enzyme, the experiment was conducted to establish the extrusion process conditions including moisture contents, melt temperature, and screw speed. The extruded products were then analysed for degree of molecular degradation, light microscopic structure, reducing sugars of the water soluble materials, water absorption index, water solubility index, enzyme susceptibility, and gelatinisation endothermic energy. Increased mechanical and thermal energy input received by the products in the extruder resulted in a significant degradation of the molecular weight of the macromolecules. Light photomicrographs also suggested that the granule structures of the extrudates have been reshaped. All extrudate samples had a very low gelatinisation endothermic energy compared to its native starch. The specific mechanical energy received by the products in the extruder was calculated and related to the process variables. The possibility of using the products in food application was also discussed.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">starch</field><field name="subject">sago</field><field name="subject">granules</field><field name="subject">extrudates</field><field name="subject">enzyme</field><field name="subject">gelatin</field><field name="subject">properties</field><field name="subject">macromolecules</field><field name="subject">Metroxylon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the Sydney region in relation to corrosion, timber decay risk factors and the corrosion of nails in timber in covered conditions</field><field name="creator">McGeachie, M.

Factors affecting its potential commercial cultivation were explored and a contribution to knowledge of the morphology and cultivation of Australian species of Lepista has been made. Australian collections of Lepista were made within a 200 km zone of Sydney. A study of the morphology and taxonomic species of these collections was undertaken. Intra- and inter-fertility crosses were completed with French L. nuda and L. sordida to determine genetic relationships and biological species. Suitable substrates for agar medium, spawn production and cultivation were explored. The response to temperature of French and Australian Lepista in vitro, and Australian Lepista under cultivation, using cold shock, was observed. The effect of modified atmosphere exchanges per hour, CO2 levels, and cold shock during the cultivation cycle and sporophore production were investigated. A genebank of Australian Lepista was established. Three species of Lepista were found in Australia : L. nuda, L. sordida and L. saeva. Two other groups of Lepista were identified. The use of A. bisporus compost appeared to be optimal for experimental and commercial applications. Australian isolates of Lepista tolerate higher temperatures than French isolates, and grew at double the rate of the French at all temperatures except 5 degrees centigrade. The length of the spawn run was reduced from 43-58 days to 12-16 days with introduced CO2 of 9,000-11,000 ppm, but an erratic cyclic pattern of net CO2 production occurred which could only be stabilised by increasing ventilation. This initial cyclic pattern appeared to inhibit subsequent sporophore formation.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">edible fungus</field><field name="subject">Lepista</field><field name="subject">substrates</field><field name="subject">intra-fertility</field><field name="subject">inter-fertility</field><field name="subject">sporophore formation</field><field name="subject">spawn run</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of alternate mucosal routes of prophylactic immunisation using a mouse model of Helicobacter infection</field><field name="creator">Wilson, John Edward</field><field name="description">Throughout history a diversity of animal species have been used and studied extensively in the development of vaccines for the benefit of humans and animals alike. As mice are a relatively easy species to maintain, handle and manipulate, and have the advantage of being cost effective, they are commonly employed as animal models in the investigation of immunisation strategies against mucosal associated pathogens. Vaccine research against the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is extensively conducted in a mouse model and typically uses intra-gastric administration for the testing of potential vaccine candidates. An inherent complication with this route, however, is that the vaccine constituents may be inadequately delivered to sites of specific immunity and consequently may not be the optimal method for vaccine delivery. In the present study a mouse model of H. pylori infection was used to determine the efficacy of alternate mucosal routes of immunisation from examination of protective immunity, immune responses and the practical aspects of vaccine administration. Commencing with the optimisation of intra-intestinal immunisation, the direct injection of a H. pylori vaccine to initiator sites of the mucosal immune system established baseline data of dose rates for the comparative analysis of intra-gastric, intra-nasal and intra-rectal immunisation. Following the development of simple administration techniques whilst maintaining the welfare of the animals, intra-nasal immunisation was shown to elicit the highest level of prophylaxis against H. pylori challenge. Effective prophylaxis was also shown to be dependent upon a specific ratio of the vaccine constituents. When using whole cell lysate of H. pylori and the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin, the ratio of antigen:adjuvant for optimal protective immunity was 10:1. The outcomes of this study have proved conclusively the necessity for optimisation of all aspects of immunisation in an animal model of infection.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="subject">H. pylori</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal</field><field name="subject">intra-intestinal</field><field name="subject">intra-nasal</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competitiveness of Australian small to medium enterprises in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Leith, Andrew R</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to determine whether Indonesian business practices and culture inhibit the competitiveness of Australian small to medium enterprises in Indonesia. Prior to the current economic demise of the Indonesian economy, Australia's trade relations with its closest Asian neighbour were not as significant as trade with countries far removed from Australia's shores. Previous research has identified that cultural problems and inadequate communication contribute towards the lack of competitiveness of international small to medium enterprises.However there has been no rigorous and comprehensive research specially related to Australian entrepreneurs and the problems they encounter in Indonesia.Several key themes emerged from this study which indicated that thorough planning and market research are more important than a comprehensive understanding of business practices and culture. What the research brings to extant literature is a rigorous and methodological analysis of Indonesian business practices from an Australian entrepreneur's perspective. This provides a structured link between the parent disciple of cross cultural communications, the plethora of information on Asian business practices, and the reality of Australian small to medium enterprises attempting to enter the Indonesian market</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business opportunities (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">Australian corporations</field><field name="subject">Indonesian commerce</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intercultural communication: a multicultural perspective</field><field name="creator">Hall, Douglas Alan</field><field name="description">Intercultural communication theory and research have largely been based on the assumption that dealing with cultural differences is the key element in intercultural encounters. This is applied particularly to encounters between people from different societies, either where a participant is visiting another country, or where that participant has recently migrated. Encounters between people who, though culturally different, live permanently together in the same society however, are not necessarily the same as encounters between people from different societies. In the light of this, intercultural communication theory should be reviewed and developed to better conceptualise the nature of intercultural interaction as it occurs within the same (multicultural) society. Such a review requires a framing of intercultural communication episodes within a broader social perspective, a more thorough investigation of the relationship of homogeneity and heterogeneity as it affects intercultural interaction and a greater focus how communication processes help to create culture as well as how they are influenced by culture. An organising model for the multicultural perspective is therefore proposed based on three key elements. First it incorporates a system approach that recognises influences on communication, the interactive process and the outcomes of that process. Second, it incorporates a three-tiered approach that recognises the role played by structural processes in establishing the character of the society, the general patterns of interaction that emerge from these structural processes and the individual application of these processes in communicative episodes. Third, it incorporates a recognition of the interplay of centripetal and centrifugal forces at each of these levels and the range of intercultural possibilities that this raises. The organising model is then used to analyse intercultural interactions across four focuses: meaning, social relations, identity and behaviour</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicultural perspective</field><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovative practice in the process of patient management in palliative care</field><field name="creator">Davison, Graydon</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the management of multidisciplinary teams in a highly innovative environment through a study of multidisciplinary patient care teams in palliative care. It investigates management that enables spontaneous innovation where necessary, yet maintains discipline and compliance with legislation, regulation and policy. To assist the explanation a model of palliative care multidisciplinary team management and operation is developed, building on work described in the continuous innovation and organisational configuration literatures. This thesis describes innovative practices as focusing on changing the organisation&#8217;s social potential, when necessary, in order to match changes in an individual patient&#8217;s situation. A definition of innovation suitable to this environment is developed here, adapted from the innovation literature. A definition of social potential suitable to this environment is also developed, based primarily in the literature of the socialisation of organisations. In palliative care organisations, care is delivered to the patient and any group of people supporting the patient during the end of life process. Care provided to these supporters, referred to in this thesis as patient-based carers, can extend beyond the death of the patient. Palliative care is more than symptom management during the dying process and can involve an interaction lasting weeks or months between the organisation and patients and patient-based carers. A patient&#8217;s situation is described at many levels and involves a number of aspects of the patient&#8217;s condition and life; for example medical, social, psychosocial, spiritual and physical. In palliative care, patients and patient-based carers are the major sources of information about their situation and changes to it. This makes them active participants in the care team, although some patients and patient-based carers choose not to take this role. Every patient and every group of patient-based carers creates individualised situations when progressing through their end of life processes, requiring individualised care from teams that can change the membership mix to suit the situation. Palliative care professionals can be members of multiple individual patient care teams simultaneously and teams can include heads of discipline (managers). Multidisciplinary palliative care teams can be managed from inside or outside the team, as the situation requires. Uncertainty pervades this environment and the response is flexibility based in learning and understanding. From the model developed of the management of innovation in the palliative care environment implications for the management of multidisciplinary teams in a highly innovative environment are drawn.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Palliative treatment</field><field name="subject">terminal care</field><field name="subject">holistic nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of selected water quality parameters at Narellan Creek</field><field name="creator">Xu, Yan Fan</field><field name="description">A two-year study was conducted at the Narellan Creek Catchment between September 1998 and August 2000. To improve the quality of the water that flows in to the Nepean River, the Harrington Park retention basin was enlarged and rehabilitated from 7.0 ha to 12.0 ha area. This study measured several parameters of water quality to assess the efficiency of the Harrington Park retention basin for water quality improvement. Three sampling sites &#8211; the Camden Valley Way (CVW), Harrington Park retention basin (HPK) and Kirkham Lane (KLN) were selected for sample collection. Water flows from CVW to HPK then to KLN and finally to the Nepean River. Rainfall, water level, discharge rate and ambient temperature were recorded at the KLN site while the selected water quality parameters were determined at all the three sites. Low flow samples were manually collected at monthly intervals. An auto-sampler which collected water samples during rain events (for high flow data) was set up at the KLN site. Rising stage samplers which collected water at different water levels during a rain event, was set up at all the sites but data from this device was found to be of limited use due to the varying time lags between the filling of each bottle. Statistical analyses by various measures show that the Harrington Park retention basin played a significant role in improving the upstream and in-stream water quality. These study shows that constructed wetlands like the Harrington Park retention basin has the ability to significantly improve the water quality of a catchment. The water quality improvement is greater at lower water flow rates.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water quality management</field><field name="subject">Narellan Creek (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">water quality measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An intercultural approach to composition and improvisation</field><field name="creator">Strazzullo, Guy</field><field name="description">Experiences as a composer and performer in Australia involve a number of significant collaborations with musicians from diverse cultures and musical backgrounds.

This initiative forms part of the Healthy Cities strategy and is reinforced through the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. The WHO Food Safety Division has indicated that every city in the WHO Healthy City program will eventually also have a Healthy Marketplace program. This is despite the absence of any published guidelines for facilitating program implementation, a clearly articulated Healthy Marketplace concept, and a dearth of meaningful program evaluations. This thesis set out to explore the views and experiences of in-country stakeholders involved in a Vietnamese Healthy Marketplace program. It also set out to examine the roles and perceptions of experts engaged in the design and delivery of programs across the developing world. Through an iterative and post-positivist research methodology, this inquiry collected and analysed data from five key sources: documents, detailed questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and observations and reflections. The findings revealed that various and even conflicting program concepts and aims existed across and within groups, having significant implications for practice. The settings approach was not the dominant approach to health promotion in the Vietnamese market, but rather a 'top-down' topic-based approach dominated as the mechanism for program delivery. Consequently, numerous challenges have been identified for Healthy Marketplace policy and practice. The challenges are prefaced on the adoption of a settings approach, and include the need for : market communities to set their own agendas; the program target audience to be redefined; increased power sharing across stakeholders; the re-education of professionals; the sharing of knowledge; and the adequate resourcing of Healthy Marketplace programs</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketplace</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">World Health Organization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heavy metals in biota from temperate Australian estuaries</field><field name="creator">Claus, Sonia Carmel</field><field name="description">The detection of anthropogenic impacts in our estuaries has become a critical social, political and scientific concern in recent years. Work has focussed on the effects of these impacts on the spatial and temporal patterns of biotic assemblages and searched for bioindicators and biomarkers of pollutants that may act as early warning signs. The estuaries in temperate Southeastern Australia have a diversity of biotic assemblages living in the soft sediment. One of the most abundant macroinvertebrates is the little studies mussel, Xenostrobus securi that is found living with an assemblage of benthic biota including amphipods, crabs, isopods and tanaids, bivalves and gastropods. Two commercial fish species bream and mullet also inhabit these estuaries. Numerous stormwater drains can be found entering the estuaries through the mangrove forests lining the shores. Along with inputs of freshwater, stormwater drains are thought to be responsible for the entry of heavy metals into estuaries. These heavy metals have the potential to alter the patterns of biotic assemblages and bioaccumulate in the tissues of miacroinvertebrates, mussels and fish living within temperate estuaries. Over the time of this study the concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment tissues and shell of X.Securis varies spatially and temporally. Although this study adds substantially to current knowledge there is still more that is needed to establish X. Securis as a bioindicator. Questions remain about uptake, depuration and response to environmental gradients of heavy metals in X. Securis.

Previous research demonstrated that such system has large energy absorption capacity which is critical in the event of an earthquake. By filling steel RHS with concrete, the failure of the steel shell due to local buckling can be delayed and the ductility of the concrete core can be improved as a result of the confinement of the steel shell. This type of composite section may be used in various structures including frames of high rise buildings, bridges, offshore structures, cast-in-situ piles in foundation etc. Design methods for concrete-filled steel tubular sections are recommended in a number of code of practices. Due to the significant differences in the material properties between normal strength concrete and high strength concrete, there is a need to study the behaviour of composite sections with higher strength concretes. The study emphasises ultimate strength, ductility, post-failure strength reserve and interface bond. It also emphasises ductility and post-failure strength of the composite beams due to the brittle behaviour of higher strength concretes when compared to normal strength concrete. Spreadsheet graph were used to present the results such as load versus strains, load versus deflections etc. In this thesis analytical study is presented on the calculation of ultimate moment of resistance of the concrete-filled RHS beams. Among the main considerations of the derivation, the steel portion was assumed either elastic-perfectly plastic or perfectly plastic and concrete carries no strength in the tensile zone. At the interface both full bond and partial bond were assumed for comparison. Efforts were also made to calculate the midspan deflections of the composite beams. Simple analytical expressions derived from this study can be coded to a prgrammable calculator or in a small spreadsheet program for design use. Finite element studies were carried out by using a proprietorship software package ANSYS. In the analysis of concrete-filled, three types of elements with large deformation and nonlinear capabilities were used. A plastic shell element, a solid concrete element with cracking and crushing capabilities, and a nonlinear spring contact element were used to model the steel shell, the concrete core and the interface respectively.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ductility</field><field name="subject">composite beams</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">brittle behaviour</field><field name="subject">earthquake</field><field name="subject">ANSYS software</field><field name="subject">tensile zone</field><field name="subject">buckling</field><field name="subject">bridges</field><field name="subject">buildings</field><field name="subject">off-shore structures</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge and commitment in innovation processes</field><field name="creator">Waters, John Frederick</field><field name="description">This study was aimed at achieving an understanding of the role of knowledge and commitment in the process of innovation. To do that, the study confronted several intractable problems of innovation research that have created barriers to knowledge accumulation. Theoretical models were developed based on organizational knowledge and commitments and aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional research models. Theoretical models of organizational change were investigated through multiple case studies of innovation projects that compared organizations of different types and size, and change processes of both technological and administrative character. A conclusion from this research is that innovation research should learn to live with the dialectic that innovation is unrelated to knowledge or outcomes. This would help to focus research attention on the means by which knowledge is transformed into action, the central problem of the management of innovation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational change, Australia</field><field name="subject">innovation research</field><field name="subject">knowledge accumulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of phosphorus removal by constructed wetland systems</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Gregory Lawrence</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to provide a detailed investigation of phosphorus transformations in constructed wetlands. Five replicate Wetland Units were constructed adjacent the wastewater treatment plant in Richmond, Australia. Each wetland was supplied with secondary or tertiary sewage effluent and planted identically with species of schoenoplectus, Phragmites, and Triglochin. Detention times for each Unit were established at 5 or 15 days. Phosphorus concentrations were monitored routinely at the inlet and outlet of each Unit, with a number of specific studies conducted to investigate internal transformations. These studies, undertaken in 1994 and 1995, determined that plants were the dominant phosphorus store in the short term, during wetland establishment and that sediments were the dominant long-term phosphorus storage compartment. Laboratory investigations indicated that there was no significant role for bacteria or algae in the water column relating to phosphorus sequestering, although microorganisms appeared to have some role in the translocation of phosphorus to soil binding sites. After phosphorus contacted the soil surface, transpiration related entrainment of surface water and direct phosphorus uptake by plants were the dominant mechanisms for causing phosphorus to move deeper through the soil substrate. Removal of phosphorus from the interstitial water was by incorporation to biomass or direct sorption to soil binding sites</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wetland</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">wastewater</field><field name="subject">soil binding sites</field><field name="subject">Richmond, Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medicine, money and madness : conversations with psychiatrists - a postmodern perspective</field><field name="creator">Keirnan, Elizabeth Carole.</field><field name="description">Foucault speaks of the formation of an individual&#8217;s identity, or the process of becoming someone else, as a worthy game.

The project was initiated as a response to a request from an Aboriginal man for a &#8216;story about alcohol&#8217; which would fill a missing link in traditional Aboriginal conceptualisation of alcohol. The &#8216;story&#8217; would have a role in indigenous treatment of alcohol abuse, put in a symbolic form consistent with oral teaching methods of indigenous custom. The project is centred around the development of an original performance script. The thesis describes the origin, context, development, rationale and implications of the project, especially with a view to considering the potential of the mythologem of Dionysos as a therapeutic paradigm in intercultural substance abuse work. Particular attention is given to the relationship between Aboriginal and European therapeutic practitioners and the use of myth, metaphor, symbolic function and specific Aboriginal &#8216;dreaming stories&#8217; as a source and backup to therapeutic practice. Principal themes include the role of mythopoetic symbol formation in the development of thinking; reflections on the presence of theriomorphic serpentine imagery in the work; the role of stories as mental containers of therapeutic theory; reflections on the &#8216;milieu&#8217; needed for implementing intercultural therapeutic procedures; examples of positive indigenous responses to alcohol work; preliminary notions on cross cultural transference communications; and reflections on primal states associated with alcohol intoxication.

The ability of the duck to perform diet self selection was then examined for its potential use in the Australian industry. The outcome of the diet self selection experiments showed that ducks sometimes self select diets when offered choices from four diets differing in nutrient density.

Crew resource management (CRM) is one such effort which, while it has done much to identify pilot behaviours, has not translated easily into useable selection and general performance instruments. CRM has not yet identified an umbrella construct which clearly and efficiently organises management of flight aspects of the airline piloting role. Markers that are used by airline check and training personnel in a specific airline to assess suitability for command were identified. Organisational understanding of SA was explored and revealed a more strategic focus than the tactical approach adopted by preceding researchers. In a further study, this strategic focus was investigated through a series of semi-structured interviews with experienced airline Captains. Recurring activity themes were identified and were found to approximate the proposed constructs of self-regulation. This concept was explored and defined in a further study which identified actions which were considered essentials to the functionality of each of these recurring themes.

It is a history of a system of thought which is one of the contemporary foundations of the way we interpret the nature and extent of crime today. It argues that the incitement to annually record crime statistics in New South Wales, and internationally, is immediately connected with a will to govern crime. This thesis traces this bonding of the technology of crime statistics with mentalities of government, and maintains that although the connection of these two discourses has been highly effective, it has not been one of universal domination. This is a history of the continuous state practice of compiling and publishing crime statistics. But it is also a history of discontinuities. This thesis regularly investigates shifts in the categories of recording. It locates changes in what is recorded by broadening its discussion to include localised and international debates on crime that are contemporaneous to these changes. This is not a thesis with a project to improve the way in which we record or utilise crime statistics. Its project is to write a history of how we came to record crime statistics and how we have intended to utilise these crime statistics in our practices of government.

The ion chamber measurement will not be accurate if there is not enough phantom material surrounding the ion chamber to provide the electron equilibrium condition. The lack of electron equilibrium will cause a reduction of dose. This may introduce problems in treatment planning. Because some planning algorithms cannot predict the reduction, they over estimate the dose in the region. Electron disequilibrium will happen when the radiation field size is too small or the density of irradiated material is too low to provide sufficient electrons going into the dose volume. The amount of tissue required to provide electron equilibrium in a 6MV photon beam by three methods: direct calculation from Klein-Nisina equation, measurement in low density material phantom and a Monte Carlo simulation is done to compare with the measurement, an indirect method from a planning algorithm which does not provide an accurate result under lateral electron disequilibrium. When the error starts to happen in such planning algorithm, we know that the electron equilibrium conditions does not exist. Only the 6MV photon beam is investigated. This is because in most cases, a 6MV small fields are used for head and neck (larynx cavity) and 6MV fields are commonly used for lung to minimise uncertainity due to lateral electron at higher energies.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radiation dose</field><field name="subject">radiation therapy</field><field name="subject">ion chamber</field><field name="subject">phantom material</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">Klein-Nisina equation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methodologies and tools for etransforming small- to medium-size enterprises</field><field name="creator">Kazanis, Phillip</field><field name="description">The 21st century is an age of conducting business electronically.

There are two components to this question; firstly the nature of competitiveness in a globalised environment, and secondly, the issue of how an orgaisation can etransform.The background material investigated at the initiation of this work can be broadly categorised into two types (1)theoretical possibilities; proposing 'potential' uses of internet technologies and (2)case studies reporting on existing ebusinesses. A detailed literature review of eBusiness was conducted to discover what made these organisations different from a traditional business. The next phase in this research work involved development of the eTransformation Roadmap, a tool that served two purposes. Firstly, to measure the current Information Technology sophistication of a business. Secondly, to show the steps that an organisation can take to become an eBusiness.

In Australia, on-site collection and storage of potable water for domestic use is carried out by approximately 30.4 percent of the rural population while 90% of the population in Papua New Guinea access water from on-site collection and storage of potable water. Few studies have monitored the quality of such water supplies on a seasonal and event associated basis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological and physio-chemical properties of the on-site domestic water supply systems and various factors that may influence characteristics of the water. It aimed to evaluate the relationship of microbiological and physio-chemical characteristics in the water supply systems. 14 rainwater tanks, 4 bore well and 10 reticulated water supply sites in Hawkesbury District, NSW Australia were investigated. Characteristics of the sites physical situation and natural environmental condition were considered to be similar to on-site water supply situations in Papua New Guinea. The results and techniques of the study will be used as a model in Papua New Guinea in the assessment of water quality issues. As the study showed that the quality of water in rainwater tanks was below WHO guideline recommendations on numerous instances, it was proposed that water treatment and maintaining the cleanliness of roof catchments, gutters and tanks should be addressed for domestic use systems.

These thermal reactions are dominated by heat and mass transfer mechanisms inside an oven chamber as well as inside the dough pieces. In this study, an industrial baking process was divided into 4 zones. Experiments were conducted, and mathematical models were developed to account for the heat and mass contribution as well as their consequent impacts on the product qualities. Monitoring systems were developed and installed inside an industrial oven to evaluate oven performance, including temperature profile and airflow pattern. Many other tests and experiments were conducted and results given in some detail. To deal with the complexity of a continuous baking process, a three dimensional transient-state CFD model with moving grids was established to account for the effect of oven load on heat transfer in the oven chamber. The dynamic response of the travelling tin temperature profiles could be predicted in accordance with a change in the oven load. The modelled tin temperature profiles showed a good agreement with the measured tin temperature profiles from the actual industrial baking process. Finally, the three-dimensional CFD model could provide guidance in manipulating the oven condition to achieve the optimum temperature profile in the industrial travelling-tray baking oven.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial oven</field><field name="subject">breadmaking</field><field name="subject">machine design</field><field name="subject">commercial oven</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models for authorization and conflict resolution</field><field name="creator">Ruan, Chun</field><field name="description">Access control is a significant issue in any secure computer system. Authorization models provide a formalism and framework for specifying and evaluating access control policies that determine how access is granted and delegated among particular users. The aim of this dissertation is to investigate flexible decentralized authorization model supporting authorization delegation, both positive and negative authorization, and conflict resolution. A graph based authorization framework is proposed which can support authorization delegations and both positive and negative authorizations. In particular, it is shown that the existing conflict resolution methods are limited when applied to decentralized authorization models and cyclic authorizations can even lead to undesirable situations. A new conflict resolution policy is then proposed, which can support well controlled delegation by giving predecessors higher priorities along the delegation path. The thesis provides a formal description of the proposed model and detailed descriptions of algorithms to implement it. The model is represented using labelled digraphs, which provide a formal basis for proving the semantic correctness of the model. A weighted graph based model is presented which allows grantors to further express degrees of certainties about their granting of authorizations. The work is further extended to consider more complex domains where subjects, objects and access rights are hierarchically structured and authorization inheritance along the hierarchies taken into account. A precise semantics is given which is based on stable model semantics, and, several important properties of delegatable authorization programs investigated. The framework provides users a reasonable method to express complex security policy. To address the many situations in which users may need to be granted or delegated authorizations for a limited period of time, a temporal decentralized authorization model is proposed in which temporal authorization delegations and negations are allowable. Proper semantic properties are further investigated. Finally, as an application, the thesis shows how the proposed authorization model can be used in a e-consent system on health data. A system architecture for e-consent is presented and different types of e-consent models discussed. The proposed model is shown to provide users a good framework for representing and evaluating these models.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">access control</field><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">authorizations</field><field name="subject">delegations</field><field name="subject">conflict resolution</field><field name="subject">semantics</field><field name="subject">algorithm</field><field name="subject">graph</field><field name="subject">e-consent</field><field name="subject">system architecture</field><field name="subject">hierarchy</field><field name="subject">framework</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular structure and odor mixture perception</field><field name="creator">Legha, Prem</field><field name="description">The sense of smell is a primal sense for humans as well as animals.In everyday life the smells encountered are composed of dozens, even hundreds of odors; few arise from a single odorant. Enormous numbers of odors occur due to the vast variation in the concentration, size and structure of odorant molecules that makes olfaction differ from simpler visual or auditory dimensions. Accordingly, little is known about the ways in which changes in molecular structure and concentration of individual odorants change odor quality. Also, currently not much is understood about synergism/antagonism, how one odorant masks or suppresses another in mixtures and there is no method for predicting which odor will be suppressed. The two main objectives of this thesis were to determine whether a part of a molecular structure rather than the whole structure plays a key role in odor quality and whether a key part of a molecule can be used to choose antagonists for that odorant. For this study three classes of musks and two potential antagonists were used. The results of the study are discussed in some detail. It is concluded that future studies of the importance of molecular structure in mixture interactions require substantially more information on the relation between structure and odor quality to allow systematic studies to be developed. In summary the two hypotheses investigated were not supported by the results. Importantly, however, they do support the view that it is likely that odor quality is dependent on the whole structure of an odorant not a single feature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smell</field><field name="subject">molecule</field><field name="subject">olfactometry</field><field name="subject">odour</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving out : the impact of deinstitutionalisation on salient affective variables, social competence and social skills of people with mild intellectual disabilities</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Roselyn May</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the social competency and affective functioning of people with mild intellectual disabilities through salient variables that impact on people with disabilities who have been deinstitutionalised.

It was found experimentally, that the operating temperature of the AC induction motor affected the ability of the PI controller to maintain the set speed. The linear PI algorithm approximation was observed to produce transient speed responses when sudden changes in load occurred. The neuro-fuzzy design was found to be quite involved in the initial design stages. However, after the initial design, it was a simple matter of fine-tuning the algorithm, to optimize performance for any parameter variations of the motor due to temperature or due to sudden changes in load. The neuro-fuzzy algorithm can be developed utilising one of two methods. The first method utilises sensor-less control by detailed modeling of the induction motor; where all varying parameters of the motor are modeled mathematically. This involves using differential equations, and representing them in the form of system response block diagrams. When the overall plant transfer function is known, a fuzzy PI algorithm can be utilised to control the processes of the plant. The second method involves modeling the overall output response as a second order system. Raw data can then be generated in a text file format, providing control data according to the modeled second order system. Using the raw data, development software such as FuzzyTECH is utilised to perform supervised learning, so to produce the knowledge base for the overall system. This method was utilised in this thesis and compared to the conventional PI algorithm. The neuro-fuzzy algorithm implemented on a PLC was found to provide better performance than the PI algorithm implemented on the same PLC. It provided also in the added flexibility for further fine-tuning and avoided the need for rigorous mathematical manipulation of linear equations</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">algorithm</field><field name="subject">linear equations</field><field name="subject">induction motor</field><field name="subject">software</field><field name="subject">fuzzy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ngapartji-ngapartji : ecologies of performance in Central Australia : comparative studies in the ecologies of Aboriginal-Australian and European-Australian performances with specific focus on the relationship of context, place, physical environment, and personal experience</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Anne</field><field name="description">All forms of cultural interaction are expressive and creative.

So what is performance and how does it differ in cultures? A performance is a translation of an idea into a synaesthetic experience. In the context of this thesis, however, translation does not imply reductive literal translation as can be attempted by analogy in spoken or written descriptions and notation systems. The translation is one through which participating groups and individuals seek to understand the being in the world of the Other by means of mutual, embodied negotiation of meaning - sensually, experientially, perceptually, cognitively and emotionally - that is, by means of performance.

Allozyme polymorphism surveys using cellulose acetate strips have revealed, from 43 enzymes screened, 18 putative polymorphic loci. Comparisons of levels of heterozygosity among enzyme structural groups showed no significant differences, however, monomers were significantly more variable as a group than multimers. Significant differences in the level and distribution of polymorphism among functional groups of enzymes were observed. It appears that selection may be acting at the molecular level, not only on a particular locus, but on a group of functionally similar loci. At the macrogeographic scale, significant departures from random mating were observed in most populations. Significant differences in allele distribution among populations of A. trapezia along the east coast of Australia were found. At the macrogeographic scale, heterogeneity of allele frequencies may depend upon the distance separating the populations and surface water currents. Differentiation among population groups in this study is attributed to changes in the direction of the East Australian Current combined with onshore countercurrents. The systematic status of the disjunct western Australian population of A. trapezia was also evaluated as compared with the east coast populations. No evidence of genetic, hence evolutionary divergence was found. The results have serious implications in the management of fisheries as erroneous assumptions in fisheries management models may lead to depletion and near extinction of marine species. The research stresses the necessity of sampling at multiple scales and replication strategies. It also highlighted the complexities researchers are faced with in studies of marine bivalves, such as the presence of null alleles, deficiencies of heterozygotes, apparent inbreeding and the small geographic scales governing population structure.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anadara trapezia</field><field name="subject">polymorphic</field><field name="subject">loci</field><field name="subject">alleles</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">variation</field><field name="subject">heterozygotes</field><field name="subject">macrogeograhic</field><field name="subject">microgeographic</field><field name="subject">fisheries management</field><field name="subject">enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/56</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lesbian identity narratives: telling tales of a stigmatised identity</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Christine E</field><field name="description">An individual&#8217;s identity is thought to accommodate and reflect his or her changing drives, abilities, beliefs, roles and obligations in an ever-changing environment, and a social or group identity is perceived as a contextually-bound aspect of this. When identity is stigmatised, expressions of identity are constrained by stigma management mechanisms, including group narratives. This study analyses the identity narratives of 64 lesbians as told to another lesbian, in particular referential, structural, interactional and functional aspects as well as a set of quantitative measures. While these lesbians experienced common life events, their narratives comprised a reflection of developmental tasks in one or more of 5 aspects of lesbian identity: lesbian sexual identity, transition to lesbian identity, stigma management, lesbian relationships and lesbian community involvement. The narratives were constrained by group interpretations: common &#8220;Lesbian Scripts&#8217; and &#8216;Thematic Lines&#8217; were identified which were correlated with identity factors. The inclusion of particular scripts and thematic lines in a lesbian&#8217;s narrative was associated with her level of identification as a lesbian, her level of commitment to her identity, her attitude to stigma and/or lesbianism, her age, and the number of years she has spent identifying as lesbian. The study concludes that the function of lesbian narrative includes demonstration of group membership, location within the group, demonstration of worthiness and morality, identity repair, and identity affirmation</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lesbianism</field><field name="subject">stigma</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Light as surface and intensity</field><field name="creator">Edmonds, Anne</field><field name="description">Light Intensity and Surface is the title of this PhD art exhibition where I explore through paintings, the world of my own encounter with the radiant light of the Linear Accelerator used in treatment of women with breast cancer. This engagement with the world of light technology encompasses oncologists, physicists and women who extended their personal experience to inform my artwork and contribute to the theoretical connections made in this thesis. The contribution of this thesis lies in how the lecture The Origin of the Work of Art by philosopher Martin Heidegger can be applied to a reading of great artworks that are separated in time, space and culture but connected in their subject: Light. It was his philosophy that helped shape the connections between where art originates and what springs from the artwork itself. The concept of light in the title of this thesis refers to Heidegger&#8217;s notion of the clearing seins Lichtung-the lighting centre- the medium that holds one being to another from where the idea for an artwork springs in the artist. Surface relates to the attunement of artists throughout history to the new particularly in the science of controlling light which influences the way artists achieve the material appearance of their artwork. Intensity refers to the level of openness to the mystery of light in both physicists and artists to create and control some thing that stabilises a community and remains a source of wonder.

The thesis traces a progressive shift away from individualistic accounts of conflicts and dilemmas in learning being primarily embedded in psychological spaces, to a recognition of the importance of the social space - the cultural discourses that shape our everyday activity and interactions. This recognises that conflict is not simply a consequence of difference arising from personality, or other psychological factors, but a consequence of prevailing cultural narratives that instruct/construct us into the identities that we are. This pedagogic practice involves a change from internalising conversations to externalising conversations, thus keeping the discursive space open to the different stories, which are usually silenced by prevailing taken-for-granted explanations. For me, it is this refusal of what we are (i.e. our culturally bestowed identities), and a critique of the forces that shape us, that opens spaces within the social fabric to enable different stories to be heard and appreciated and creates opportunites for new, radical learning to occur.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postculturalism</field><field name="subject">social epistemology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On-site system effluent source tracking using geochemical and microbial tracers in a coastal catchment</field><field name="creator">Geary, Phillip M</field><field name="description">The principal aims of this thesis were to examine whether there were hydraulic links between individual on-site wastewater systems in sandy soils at Salt Ash and the Tilgerry Creek estuary near Port Stephens, New South Wales, and whether the chemical and microbiological contaminants from on-site systems could reach surface and groundwaters, and possibly lead to impacts on estuarine oyster growing waters.

It aims to explore the role of Britishness, through an examination of the influence of the London Royal Academy of Art, within theses emerging official art institutions. This study argues that the dominant artistic ideology illustrated in these National Gallery collections was determined by a social elite, which was, at its heart, British. Its collective taste was predicated on models established in Great Britain and on traditions and on connoisseurship. This visual instruction in the British ideal of culture, as seen through the Academy, was regarded as a worthy aspiration, one that was at once both highly nationalistic and also a tool of Empire unity. This ideal was nationalistic in the sense that it marked the desire of these Boards to claim for the nation membership of the world's civil society, whilst also acknowleging that the vehicle to do so was through an enhanced alliance with British art and culture. The ramifications of an Empire-first aesthetic model were tremendous. The model severely constrained taste in domestic art, limited the participation of indigenous peoples and shaped the reception of modernism.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Gallery of Australia history</field><field name="subject">National Art Gallery, New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Royal Academy of Arts, Great Britain</field><field name="subject">collection management</field><field name="subject">art museums</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lost and found : a literary cultural history of the Blue Mountains</field><field name="creator">Attard, Karen Patricia</field><field name="description">This thesis is a cultural tour of the Blue Mountains, New South Wales, Australia. It is concerned with the way in which Europeans employed stories to claim land and, conversely, their fears that the land would claim them.The stories considered are taken from literature and folk legend. The concept of liminality is important to the work because the mountains are a threshold, a demarcation between the city and the bush. Allied with the notion of liminality in the mountains is that of the uncanny (as defined by Freud). The work is divided into four sections. The first section, A POCKET GUIDE, introduces the terrain to be traversed. Section 2, FOUND, centres around the notion of foundation. Section 3, PASSAGE, links LOST and FOUND. LOST is the converse of FOUND. It explores our fears that the land will consume us.This fear is often expressed in the notion that the bush, beneath a surface beauty, has a dark and dangerous aspect and that it will swallow up the unwary. This idea is evident in the notion of possession - that a certain place can take hold of a person and induce a prescribed response from them - and of haunting, in which a spirit is tied to a specific location.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blue Mountains (NSW)</field><field name="subject">cultural history</field><field name="subject">literary history</field><field name="subject">folklore-Blue Mountains</field><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peer review in the assessment and funding of research by the Australian Research Council</field><field name="creator">Jayasinghe, Upali W.</field><field name="description">In higher education settings the peer review process is highly valued and used for evaluating the academic merits of grant proposals, journal submissions, academic promotions, monographs, text books, PhD thesis and a variety of other academic products. The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the peer review process for awarding research grants used by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Large Grants Program and to propose strategies to address potential shortcomings of the system. This study also evaluated psychometric properties such as the reliabilities of various ratings that are part of the assessment process of the ARC Large grants Program. Data for the all grant applications submitted for the 1996 round of the Large Grants Program were provided by the ARC. In a variation to the typical peer review process, applicants were given an opportunity to nominate assessors to review their proposals. The results indicated that global ratings given by the researcher-nominated assessors were systematically higher and less reliable than those by panel-nominated external reviewers chosen by the ARC. The reliability of peer reviews is not adequate by most standards. A critical direction for future research is considering what strategies need to be put in place to improve the quality of the reviews. To improve the reliability it is recommended that researcher-nominated reviewers should not be used; that there should be more reviews per proposal and a smaller more highly selected core of reviewers should perform most of the reviews within each sub-discipline providing a greater control over error associated with individual reviewers</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peer review of research grant proposals</field><field name="subject">research grants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An outline of the Shilha (Berber) vernacular of Douiret (Southern Tunisia)</field><field name="creator">Gabsi, Zouhir</field><field name="description">The Tunisian Berber (or Shilha) vernaculars are among the least described Afroasiatic (Hamito-Semitic) languages to this day. Although they have been provisionally assigned to the North-Berber group within the Berber branch of Afroasiatic, their immediate affiliation remains an open question. The principal task of this present work is to describe the phonology, morphology and syntax of Douiret. Less central to the aims of the study is the analysis of the basic wordstores of the three surviving Shilha varieties which include Douiret, Chninni (or Chenini) and Ouirsighen (Jerba). The Shilha variety of Douiret is chosen for this study because it still retains some fundamental elements of Berber structure which are not very dissimilar to other Berber languages such as Kabyle and Tamazight. The research shows that Tunisian Berber still survives today, but its future remains uncertain in the face of the forces of urbanisation, economic migration and lack of government support all of which may contribute hypothetically to its likely death. This study will be pursued with reference to the social and cultural context of the Tunisian Berber vernaculars. Research on the nature of language contact bewtween Tunisian Arabic and Shilha is practically non-existent and in this study, is a secondary concern. The strong influence of the local Arabic superstratum on Shilha in phonology, morphology, syntax and lexis is also investigated, as well as the presence of Berber elements in the distinctive Arabic dialect of Tunisia. As the thesis title suggests, this study should not be taken as the last word on Berber in Tunisia. The little available data on Berber in Tunisia makes the task harder in establishing a clear picture of its structure and relationship with other Berber languages such as Kabyle and Tamazight.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shilha language</field><field name="subject">Tunisian language</field><field name="subject">syntax of Shilha language</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land subdivision and agriculture</field><field name="creator">Chant, Jennifer Jane</field><field name="description">This report outlines research into the impact of subdivision on agriculture, and agricultural land resources, and its regional socio-economic importance.

It is confirmed that teachers can integrate electronic storybooks into their classroom practices to create enjoyable and productive learning experiences. A range of pedagogical approaches was used and the introduction of electronic storybooks had a positive effect on student motivation, enthusiasm and achievement of learning goals, and resulted in changes in the physical composition of the classroom and the way learning was structured.

It has been discovered that accounting terms have various equivalents in ordinary and specialised dictionaries. The translation of terms is so problematical that it is difficult to distinguish between one term and the next. Although the definitions given to some terms may vary from one dictionary to the other, the Arabic equivalents adopted confuse the user as to the real meaning and usage of such terms. Confusion is deepened when terms of different accounting and commercial nature are being used as if they were synonyms, judging by the Arabic equivalents given to them. Furthermore, there are accounting terms referring to taxation which are unique to Australia and require explanation and translation. Having evaluated the dictionaries and assessed the equivalents given to certain terms, I discovered the need for a new method in lexicography. The introduction of this new method is to make easier the user's task of looking up an entry in the dictionary or trying to identify it. The results achieved in this research should be beneficial to users of general and accounting dictionaries. They are concerned with the collection, description, processing and presentation of terms specific to a single subject area - accounting with reference to taxation. The introduction of an improved method in lexicography, the manner of identifying the terms, the listing of entries and the steps followed in checking equivalents are major achievements of this research. The conclusions reveal to the users the disadvantages of existing arrangements and the way the entries use listed and lack of proper equivalents. This research has led to the formulation of accounting and taxation terms that are unique to Australia and have no equivalents in the Arab World. Such inclusion of new terms would enable the Arabic speaking people to understand the accounting system and the taxation structure in Australia. Such an introduction of terms is made easy by implementing the new method with terms numbered, defined, translated, identified and cross-referenced</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-referenced</field><field name="subject">Arabic</field><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problematising the political : feminist interventions</field><field name="creator">Rossiter, Penny</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of selected themes in feminist rethinkings of the political. It explores connections between specific interpretations of the meanings and boundaries of the political, the problems of exclusion and the imagination of non-exclusionary alternatives. It traces, and responds to, shifts in these interconnected concerns that have transpired over the last three decades as feminists in western liberal democracies have moved from a preoccupation with gendered oppression, to relations of identity and difference more broadly conceived. The contrasting perspectives of Moira Gatens and Anne Phillips on political exclusion and their preferred political futures are discussed. Gatens' preferred future is a 'polymorphous, polyvocal and polyvalent body politic' but the institutional forms of that polity and its relation to actually existing liberal democracy are uncertain. Phillips apparently has more modest aspirations; for increased political presence for the politically marginalised (especially women); and for a revitalisation of the deliberative component of democracy. Although Phillips appears to hold the trump card of immediate practical relevance, the thesis questions this assumption. It argues that feminist analysis can only benefit from increased conversation between such divergent feminist responses to the problem of political exclusion. But further, it concludes that the least 'practical' may sometimes be the most important components of feminist rethinkings of the political</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women and politics</field><field name="subject">feminist politics</field><field name="subject">gendered oppression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a quality culture within a school of nursing in higher education</field><field name="creator">Cruickshank, Mary T.</field><field name="description">During the past decade, nurses in the clinical setting have began making a paradigm shift from Quality Assurance to Total Quality Management, or as it is commonly referred to within health care facililties, Continuous Quality Improvement.In contrast, scant attention has been paid to quality management practices in nursing in the higher education sector.

The field of mobile computing is the merger of advances in computing and communications with the aim of providing seamless and ubiquitous computing environment for mobile users. Whereas notebook computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are self-contained, networked computing constitutes a new paradigm of computing that is revolutionizing the way computers are used. Mobile networking greatly enhances the utility of carrying a computing device. It provides mobile users with versatile communication to other people and expedient notification of important events, yet with much more flexibility than cellular telephones and pagers. It also permits continuous access to services and resources of the traditional land-based wired networks. This combination of networking and mobility will engender new applications and services, such as collaborative software to support impromptu meetings, electronic bulletin boards that adapt to the contents according to the participants present, self adjusting lighting and heating, and navigation software to guide users in unfamiliar places and tours. To support mobility in the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) has been extended to support mobility. Also at the same time, there is also a growing trend for these IP based networks to operate in an infrastructureless environment called mobile ad-hoc networks. However, the proliferation of such mobile networks depends on a multitude of factors, with trustworthiness being one of the primary challenges to be met. The objective of this dissertation is to address the issues involved in the design of security services for Mobile IP and ad-hoc networks. Extensions to IP based networks (both wired and infrastructureless networks) to facilitate mobility have not been designed keeping security in mind. However adequate security features are basic requirements for the continued functioning of mobile networks. Clearly the problem is so broad that there is no way to devise a general solution We aim to address most of these wide- ranging problems and in the process initiate a practical approach to the development of an integrated security infrastructure for mobile networks. The intention is to seamlessly integrate these security services and mechanisms at the IP level within the mobile IP and ad-hoc networks.

To understand consumption in a time when realness and authenticity are no longer relevant, this thesis draws attention to the consumption and production of media content through case studies of consumer participation and social trends in Japan. The work begins in a themed shopping mall, Venus Fort in Tokyo Bay; continues with the reproduction of Audrey Hepburn&#8216;s image; expands to the dramatised &#8216;realness&#8217; of television; and finally moves to the omnipresent mobile phone and the impact of networked personal media on our idea of the &#8216;real&#8217;. First, through an analysis of a themed consumption environment, it is suggested that a transition is taking place in consumption from objects to experiences, services and spectacle. Secondly, by showing Audrey Hepburn&#8216;s transition from a Hollywood star to a virtualised idol, technologically-aided illusions are shown to make hierarchical realness irrelevant. Thirdly, via Reality TV dating programs, the focus shifts to the role of audience participation in the consumption of media content. These themes are demonstrated individually, then merged into the last example &#8211; the social and cultural evolution induced by the mass consumption of networked media, that promise to revolutionise the way we consume, communicate and connect between people, machines and consumer goods.The thesis grounds its analysis of contemporary trends in the culture of consumption in Japan in theories of commodity and culture, the real and the simulation, speed and reality, the spectacle and the self in mediated spaces, and probes further into the collapse of demarcations between the virtual and the real, the event and the everyday and media and the self in the network society</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computers and civilization</field><field name="subject">mass media and culture</field><field name="subject">virtual reality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The self-concept of nurses and its relationship to job satisfaction</field><field name="creator">Cowin, Leanne S.</field><field name="description">This study explores the development and rigorous testing of a new self-concept instrument designed specifically for nurses for use in a longitudinal, multicohort study on self-concept, job satisfaction and retention in nursing.The outcomes of this study are that nurses' self-concept can now be measured by a new theoretically and empirically substantiated multidimensional instrument.

The study highlights conflicting tensions on various sensemaking levels, such as that between individual need for creativity and flexibility against organisational need for regulatory standardisation, and demonstrates the need for organisations to seek answers to these challenges within their own cultural setting.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">management information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sharing and surviving the resuscitation : parental presence during resuscitation of a child in PICU : the experiences of parents and nurses</field><field name="creator">Maxton, Fiona</field><field name="description">Parents&#8217; presence and participation in their child&#8217;s care in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is now commonplace. Despite parents expressing a deep need to be with their child particularly during periods of crisis, it is precisely at these times that they are often prevented from staying. The growing debate regarding family presence during a cardiopulmonary (CPR) resuscitation attempt continues to be controversial and conflicting. Current knowledge is mostly derived from quantitative studies conducted in the adult intensive care or emergency environments. The experiences of parents of children in the PICU, and the nurses caring for them are unknown. Using van Manen&#8217;s hermeneutic phenomenological approach, this study describes the phenomenon of parental presence during resuscitation of a child in PICU for eight Australian parent couples and six nurses. Experiential descriptions, obtained in tape-recorded unstructured interviews were subjected to two layers of analysis. Thematic analysis provided the phenomenological description in seven themes. Four themes refer to the parents&#8217; experience in Being only for a child; Making sense of a living nightmare; Maintaining hope: facing reality and Living in a relationship with staff. Three themes describe the nurses&#8217; experience: Under the parents&#8217; gaze; Walking in their shoes and Holding parents in mind. A second layer of hermeneutic analysis revealed parents&#8217; and nurses&#8217; collective experience to have their being in four elements of the phenomenon. These elements are Being in chaos; Struggling to connect; Being for another and Being complete. The final description of the parents&#8217; and nurses&#8217; experience of parental presence during resuscitation in PICU as Sharing and surviving the resuscitation is drawn from the findings from each of these layers of meaning. The findings from this study conclude that the parents&#8217; inherent need to be with their child overrode their anxieties of the resuscitation scene, curbing their feelings of chaos. Parental presence however, was a complex and dynamic concept that required a new relationship between parents and nurses. Implications of this study include recommendations for improving staff knowledge and education, as well as practical interventions for enhanced support for both parents and nurses</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pediatric intensive care research</field><field name="subject">critically ill children</field><field name="subject">family relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Call waiting</field><field name="creator">Hawryluk, Lynda J.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life and career of Bret Easton Ellis, and the influences of his work on the author's development as a writer. Part one encapsulates a novel written specifically for this thesis. 'Call waiting' is a harsh look at modern friendships, the role of work in these relationships and the proliferation of shallow communication through the advent of email. A critical reflection follows, examining the process that led to the novel's creation. Three specific areas are focussed on: the direct influence of Ellis' novel 'The rules of attraction' on the overall themes of 'Call waiting', the realisation of the project and the various editing changes and narrative developments that arose during the writing of the novel, and an examination of the inspiration behind the novel's creation. Part two considers Ellis' role in the literary world of the 1980s, his own complicity in the creation of a career as a celebrity author, and the carefully manufactured persona Ellis presents to the world. In Part three the thesis is concluded with a close analysis of the publication of Ellis' controversial novel 'American psycho'. This chapter explores the negative publicity the novel attracted and the possible causes of the ensuing backlash against the author.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bret Easton Ellis</field><field name="subject">controversial fiction</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">mass media and literature</field><field name="subject">Australian authors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/6</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What can self-help support groups offer young people who experience mental health issues? : an explication of the self-help support group experiences of young people</field><field name="creator">Dadich, Ann M.</field><field name="description">This study sought to explore what Self-Help Support Groups (SHSGs) might have to offer young people who experience mental health issues. By definition, these non-profit support groups are run by and for people who come together on the basis of a shared experience. Although much research has been conducted on SHSG involvement among adults, there has been little investigation on the experiences of young people; this is despite the importance of youth mental health. Although several bodies of knowledge contributed to this study, they offered a limited understanding to the findings. Consequently, a more encompassing social capital framework was used to illuminate and challenge the findings. Among the varied understandings of social capital are two oft-cited perspectives &#8211; that of Bourdieu (1986) and that of Coleman (1988). However, that applicability of social capital to this study necessitated a theoretical extension of these two perspectives. The present study offers valuable direction to improve current social policy. This includes increased training opportunities for human service providers to raise awareness and appreciation for the unique role filled by SHSGs ; the demonstration of explicit support for SHSG&#8217;s in social policy that is relevant to mental health, substance use issues, and young people; and the establishment of a New South Wales clearing house. The thesis closes by attesting the potential benefits associated with SHSGs; if not for the potential benefit they offer young people with mental health issues, and the communities to which they belong, then as a valuable area for future investigation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group psychotherapy for youth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">social groups</field><field name="subject">self-help groups</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The DNA binding interactions of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes</field><field name="creator">Greguric, Antun</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the synthesis, characterisation, enantiomeric resolution, 1H NMR structural study and physical evaluation of a series of certain bidentate ligand metal complexes, where &#8216;L-L&#8217; denotes the ancillary bidentate ligand and &#8216;intercalator&#8217; indicates the intercalating bidentate ligand.

The non-queuing customers will be lost if the capacity is fully occupied. In these systems, particularly for higher priority customers, the reduction of the loss probabilities is essential to guarantee the quality of the service. Four different policies for high and low priorities were introduced utilizing the fixed capacity of the system, producing different loss probabilities. The same policies were introduced in the case of a low priority being placed in the queue when the system is fully occupied. An application to the Intensive Care and Coronary Care Unit in Campbelltown Public Hospital in Sydney was introduced. This application analyses the admission and discharge by using queuing theory to develop a model which predicts the proportion of patients from each category that would be prematurely transferred as a function of the size of the unit, number of categories, mean arrival rates, and length of stay.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stochastic processes</field><field name="subject">Poisson distribution</field><field name="subject">probability theory</field><field name="subject">customer service</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic investment issues for listed property trusts</field><field name="creator">Tan, Yen Keng</field><field name="description">In the context of Listed Property Trusts (LPTs), three strategic investment issues have received considerable prominence in recent years.

The three investment issues are assessed in some detail. The findings of the research suggest that the addition of international LPTs in the Australian LPT portfolio has resulted in significant diversification gains. The findings of the mixed-asset portfolio analysis suggest adding international LPTs to the Australian mixed-asset portfolio.Portfolio performance improved considerably. Mixed-asset portfolio performance is further enhanced when direct property is included.

This study investigated methods to protect these bacteria from oxygen exposure. To confirm the accuracy of the reported survival estimates of L. acidophilus or Bifidobacterium spp. in yoghurts, the reliability of several enumeration media was evaluated with different commercial yoghurts. None of the media however, was found reliable thereby casting doubts on the reported cell numbers of probiotic bacteria in yoghurts. After much research,it was found that although oxygen can be detrimental to L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp.in culture broths, it may not be significant for their poor survival in yoghurts. Nevertheless, techniques such as oxidative stress stress adaption, alternative packaging materials and microencapsulation as investigated in this study, can serve as general protective techniques to help yoghurt manufacturers in maintaining the recommended numbers of probiotic bacteria in their products. This would eventually assist in the efficient delivery of probiotic health benefits to yoghurt consumers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yoghurt research</field><field name="subject">bacteria research</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">bifidobacterium</field><field name="subject">Lactobacillus adidophilus</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies toward the development of two dimensional high performance liquid chromatographic systems for the separation of complex samples</field><field name="creator">Sweeney, Alan Peter</field><field name="description">Coupled two-dimensional HPLC systems were developed for the separation of complex sample matrices. Low molecular weight polystyrene oligomers were used as model compounds for the development of these systems since the sample dimensionality of oligostyrenes could be defined and classified according to two sample characteristics. That is, oligostyrenes could be classed as a two-dimensional sample, where one sample dimension is the variation in the number of monomers that make up oligomeric units determining the weight of the polymer, with a second sample dimension being the variation in stereoisomerism of each oligomer. During this study it was found that by combining two separation dimensions consisting of C18 and carbon clad zirconia (CCZ) phases separation of oligostyrenes according to molecular weight and stereochemistry was possible in coupled two-dimensional systems. The C18 phase separated the sample according to molecular weight, while the CCZ phase separated the sample according to the stereochemistry. The stereoisomer separations of the oligostyrenes reported on the CCZ surface were far superior to those previously reported in the literature. The efficiency of the separation process in a coupled two-dimensional system was then evaluated by studying the variation in band variance of a test probe. The results of the study indicated that the performance of a two-dimensional separation process was highly dependent upon the mobile phase compatibility, even when solvents were completely miscible and of similar polarities. Extracts from 17 species of Australian native plants were examined for xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the disease gout. Chromatographic separation was conducted on plant extracts found to possess significant inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase, with an extract from the species Clerodendrum floribundum R. Br. found to possess the greatest activity of the species examined. A two-dimensional separation of a crude extract from Clerodendrum floribundum R.

Renewed interest came in 1997 after a better Chinese Modified Dome (CMD) design was established, with this came government funding, however by 2002, some failure was also observed. This study set out to investigate the reasons why biogas digesters have never been established as a sustainable concept, its effectiveness as an animal waste management tool and what changes if any, can be made to try and influence the further development of the concept in Fiji. In order to achieve the objectives, which were simply obtaining the answers to the questions presented above, several different approaches had to be followed. This study was the first on biogas digesters in Fiji and it was unique in the sense that the major component dealt with the social aspects of farmers in relation to their biogas digesters. Basically the study was carried out in two parts - desktop studies and field studies. Desktop studies were done to better understand the situation while the field studies included semi-structured interviews with the farmers as well as the collection of biophysical data. Twelve outcomes are presented in chapter 7 of this paper. Two in particular are the improvement of construction and maintenance, which can only come about through training.

To gain maximum therapeutic benefit, the bacteria must remain viable over the shelf life of the yoghurt. Studies have shown, however, that the viability of these bacteria decreases significantly over this period and in some products, is negligible prior to the expiry date. Some strains of probiotic bacteria are oxygen sensitive. Yoghurt has been found to contain a significant concentration of dissolved oxygen and it has been proposed that this has a negative effect on probiotic viability. In this research, several tests were conducted and observations made. Experiments were conducted with non-commercial probiotic cultures to observe the effect of low oxygen environment on probiotic viability. No significant difference existed in viability between probiotic bacteria stored in oxygen reduced yoghurt and regular yoghurt. All yoghurt stored in oxygen barrier packaging material displayed enhanced shelf-life properties, this was observed in replicated experiments. Oxygen barrier packaging combined with an oxygen scavenging material was found to be the most effective oxygen removal system, particularly when used with set type yoghurt.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yoghurt research</field><field name="subject">yoghurt packaging</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">shelf life of foods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of traditional production of Ugandan fermented cereal beverage, Obushera</field><field name="creator">Kateu, Kepher Kuchana</field><field name="description">The study presented here was to investigate the traditional production of the Ugandan fermented cereal beverage, Obushera.

This sauce differs from other Asian products not only in its raw materials but also in its flavour characteristics. Presently small scale Vietnamese soy sauce is produced mostly with a standardised inoculum of Aspergillus oryzae under natural conditions. This usually gives rise to a product of variable and inconsistent quality. The aim of this study was to standardise the fermentation condition for the production of Vietnamese soy sauce, so as to obtain a product of more consistently good quality. Aspergillus flavus var columnaris was used as the inoculum. The inoculum was prepared by growing the organism on sticky rice at 20 and 37 degrees centigrade under aerobic conditions. At 20C, a high protease activity was recorded in the inoculum while at 37C, a high amylase activity was observed. The two different inocula prepared at 20C and 37C were then used in the preparation of soy sauce in the normal manner. The inocula were mixed with cooked roasted soy beans and salt water, left to age for 1 month at 30C, followed by ageing at 20C for 2 months. The products obtained were subjected to sensory evaluation and analysed for glucose, fructose, amino acids, nitrogen, ethanol and NaCI. Both inocula produced products of acceptable quality. The inoculum produced at 20C had a higher sensory evaluation score. It also contained a higher level of protein (14.5% compared to 11%), and a higher sensory evaluation score (6.9 compared to 3.2) when compared to a commercial Vietnamese sauce, Hanoi soy sauce. This valuable information will now enable small scale producers to produce this product throughout the year by controlling the temperature, and not be limited to the summer season, as has been the case with the traditional method of production.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnamese soy sauce</field><field name="subject">fermented food</field><field name="subject">soy bean</field><field name="subject">incubation</field><field name="subject">fermentation</field><field name="subject">sticky rice</field><field name="subject">flavur var columnaris</field><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">inoculum</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The subalterns speak: a collaborative inquiry into community participation in health care</field><field name="creator">Horsfall, Debbie</field><field name="description">This thesis is about change, community and the health system.

The inquiry centred on the premise that community participating is both desirable and achievable. The group spoke to over 100 people, and the conclusion was reached that, while community participation is promoted by the NSW Health Department, at present it is an idea that has not been thought through, is ill defined, and lacks support in practice.

Prior to transfer of sovereignty, there have been grave concerns for the survival of these miscegenic descendants of the Portuguese settlers who came to China some five hundred years ago. Many feared that there would be a mass exodus similar to that which overtook the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and East Timor, and that the Macanese future would be threatened by the process of Sinicisation &#8211; in short, that they are a dying race. This thesis examines such fears using a combination of newspaper survey, extensive fieldwork and repeat interviews. The outcome of the research shows that despite the dire prognostication, the community has survived the first five years of Chinese rule in robust form; the feared exodus did not eventuate and there has been no death to speak of. In the post-colonial environment, the Constitutions (Macau Basic Law) obliges the government to respect Macanese customs and cultural traditions and to protect their rights &#8211; at least for fifty years. The Macanese community in Macau is likely to continue to transform itself and adapt to a changing environment. It is likely that the transformation will occur over a long period of time, representing generations, perhaps centuries not decades.

The conformational behaviour of these compounds was investigated using dynamic NMR spectroscopy, molecular modelling techniques and X-ray crystal structure analysis. The conformational behaviour of 5- hyrdohexahydropyrimidine, hexahydropyrimidine and their analogous oxygen compounds as well as a series of hexahydropyrimidines with various exocyclic substituents, were examined. The preferred conformations of all these compounds are attenuated by a combination of steric and electronic influences. These influences include intramolecular hydrogen bonding as well as anomeric and gauche interactions. The conformational behaviour of the selected seven membered benzodiazepine rings, which share structural characteristics with the six-membered 5- hyrdohexahydropyrimidines was also explored. The increased flexibility of the seven membered rings facilitates intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which in turn retards ring inversion in these systems</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hexahydropyrimidines</field><field name="subject">heterocyclic compounds</field><field name="subject">heterocycles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systems of innovation beyond borders: linked clustering and the role, scale and spatial structure of extra-territorial interdependencies</field><field name="creator">Wixted, Brian, L</field><field name="description">The study of technological innovation covers a broad range of issues. Everything, from the public funding of science, research policy to the role of universities, from the business development of new products and services, the financing of innovation, institutional arrangements through to the spatially located conditions that promote innovation has been considered by analysts. Mostly these subject matters have been conceptualised as components of 'national&#8217; systems of innovation even when studied at different spatial levels (including regions and clusters). The emphasis of systems research is that places (nations or localities), within the global economic landscape, are especially important for the creation, spread and use of innovations. The systems perspective on innovation encourages, due to results on the development of endogenous capabilities and the proximity of knowledge spillovers, a view that production and innovation geographies are enclaves of activity, innovating largely in isolation from what is occurring in other technologically isolated systems. A central concern in the present thesis is that this view of national and sub-national systems does not provide a sufficiently comprehensive perspective on the global architecture of production. The primary goal is to begin to develop an innovation systems framework that combines the consideration of the advantages of individual spatial entities (clusters) with an analysis of value chains as they extend across regional and national borders. To achieve this, the analysis focuses on evaluating the role, scale and spatial structure of inter-cluster linkages. The literature on role of interdependencies within clusters suggests that user producer and tacit knowledge flows are more important for innovation than traded interdependencies. To aid the analysis of the scale and spatial structure of interdependencies and rather than be restricted by case studies methods which would facilitate analysis of only one or two clusters, two inter-country input-output datasets covering nine OECD countries (33 sectors) and fifteen European Union countries (25 sectors) were developed for the research project. To analyse these datasets in a manner that was consistent with the goals of the research new modelling software was constructed. The analysis of these spatial structures reveals that substantial associations exist between some clusters, with most national clusters maintaining one important connection. The analysis reveals differences in the global architecture of production for assembly based systems (motor vehicles and aerospace) when compared to modular component based systems such as electronics and computing. Just as businesses form networks, then it seems reasonable, on the basis of the research presented here, to suggest that global production consists of networks of clusters which are organised in hierarchical circuits. This evidence supports the argument developed through the present thesis that certain elements of innovation systems can be better understood through a crossborder cluster-to-cluster framework</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technological innovations</field><field name="subject">international economic relations</field><field name="subject">production economic theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shelter</field><field name="creator">Hooker, Ashleigh</field><field name="description">On a rainy summer afternoon a woman turns up on Bernadette's doorstep.

This research aims to develop a method of estimating skin exposure that is both reliable and non-prohibitive in cost. This involved the design and testing of skin patches adaptable for monitoring skin exposure to chemicals using several different types of absorbents which could be easily worn against skin. The final design of the patch used either activated charcoal or tenax as the absorbing medium. The patches were then desorbed with a solvent in order to analyse the chemicals. The results of the study showed that many skin exposures do not have a direct relationship with inhalation exposures, which is important because currently there are no estimates of the levels of skin exposures that may have potential long term health effects. The patch has proved successful for detecting the presence and determining the amount of chemicals that come in contact with the skin. Charcoal patches have the widest application, but are not suitable for all situations and tenax should be used on these occasions.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skin tests</field><field name="subject">effect of chemicals on skin</field><field name="subject">skin absorption</field><field name="subject">industrial toxicology</field><field name="subject">dermatoxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of reduced energy Thai style fresh pork sausages</field><field name="creator">Somkhumphee, Yuphin</field><field name="description">The development of a reduced energy Thai style fresh pork sausage has been achieved by replacing fat with carbohydrate and water. Replacing fat in the processed meat formulation with other ingredients is known to alter the product qualities. The addition of carbohydrate, namely mung bean vermicelli, as a fat replacement is suggested to improve the water holding capacity, cooking yield and textural properties as well as reduce the fat and total energy content. This research developed a standard processing methodology for a characteristic Thai fresh pork sausage. The research evaluated the potential of mung bean vermicelli in the formulation of a reduced energy Thai style fresh pork sausage. The reduced energy sausage was developed by replacing fat with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% soaked mung bean vermicelli. Quality characteristics of the sausages (chemical, textural and sensory) were evaluated and compared with control sausages (20% fat). The results of the present study indicated that soaked mung bean vermicelli offset many of the characteristic changes usually brought about by fat reduction. The sausages had a decreased cooking loss and an improved yield as well as a reduction in energy content.

Farmers in this region depend on water accumulated from rainfall over a fallow period and stored in the subsoil to increase wheat grain yield beyond that normally achievable from in-crop rainfall and to decrease the production risks due to rainfall variability. The large variability in stored water, seasonal rainfall and subsoil properties result in extremely varied yield and yield responses to P fertiliser between seasons and between sites. Finally, as a practical guide to predicting wheat response to P fertilizer: 1/. current sampling strategies of determining P only in the surface 10 cm appear to be adequate for soils with bicarbonate P concentrations greater than 15 mg/kg. 2/. For soils with lower concentrations in the surface, sampling of 80 cm is recommended. Crops with a mean concentration of bicarbonate P greater than 7 mg/kg between 10 - 80 cm are unlikely to respond to P fertiliser. 3/. No increase in profitable grain yield response was found for fertiliser applications greater than 10 kg P/ha.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphatic fertilizers</field><field name="subject">wheat fertilizers, Australia</field><field name="subject">wheat-water requirements</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil-water use and irrigation scheduling under fruit tree-turf alley cropping system in Hawkesbury Area</field><field name="creator">Hasnat, Abul</field><field name="description">Efficient use of irrigation and nutrients are becoming increasingly important in commercial orchards in the Hawkesbury area. Proper irrigation scheduling practices can help in the better use of irrigation water and reduce environmental impacts. Field experiments were conducted during February 1999 to June 2000 to understand soil-water use, and to evaluate farmer&#8217;s irrigation practice under an alley cropping system consisting of turf and stone fruits. The study was carried out at Atlas Farm, 3.5 km from the University of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury campus. The experimental site is a floodplain of the Hawkesbury River. The river flows within 1 km of the farm boundaries. The study was conducted under the farmer&#8217;s existing irrigation water and nutrient management practices. The main aims of the thesis were to study the movement and redistribution of soil-water and soil-moisture dynamics in the turf and stone fruit alley cropping system and to understand deep percolation losses and nitrogen leaching using the water balance approach. The study indicated that drainage occurred mainly after heavy rainfall and when there was rainfall for a few consecutive days. Thus irrigation application should be delayed if there is a likelihood of rain in a few consecutive days to prevent loss of water due to deep drainage. Furthermore, the study showed irrigation scheduling was essential to reduce nitrate leaching in the field; that irrigation depths should be varied according to the stage of crop growth, and the proper timing of irrigation application could help reduce deep percolation and runoff losses.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fruit trees</field><field name="subject">alley cropping system</field><field name="subject">water usage</field><field name="subject">turf</field><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="subject">nitrate leaching</field><field name="subject">soil-water dynamics</field><field name="subject">fertilizers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spinoza and an ethics of expression</field><field name="creator">Redshaw, Sarah</field><field name="description">There is interest in Spinoza in a range of disciplines with a focus on embodiment, agency and affect that has resulted in revisiting Spinoza as an alternative to the transcendence of dominant Cartesian thought.

The role of affect and its relation to reason in Spinoza are discussed in relation to Descartes. Jonathan Bennett and Edwin Curley&#8217;s views on affect are discussed.

Such funding is known colloquially as state aid. The state aid struggle is conceived in this thesis as an industrial relations contest that went beyond issues simply of state aid. The state aid struggle was a centrepiece of the Teachers Federation&#8217;s broader challenge to government&#8217;s intensification of efforts to reduce the federation&#8217;s effectiveness in shaping the public school system&#8217;s priorities. This thesis contends that the decisive importance of the state aid struggle arose from the fundamental strategy used by governments to lower the cost of schooling over time. To achieve this they undertook the state aid strategy &#8211; cost reductions would flow from residualising public schools, de-unionising teachers and deregulating wages and conditions. The state aid strategy was implemented through those areas of policy and funding over which the Federation had negligible control or where the Federation&#8217;s membership was disunited. The Federation was undermined by governments using policy initiatives to fragment teacher unity. By the end of 1999, governments&#8217; prosecution of the state aid strategy did not seem to have been diverted from the main thrust of its course by the federation&#8217;s struggle.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public schools, N.S.W., history</field><field name="subject">government aid to private schools, N.S.W.</field><field name="subject">federal aid to private schools, N.S.W.</field><field name="subject">politics and education, N.S.W.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exact solution for vibration of stepped circular Mindlin plates</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Lei</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the first-known exact solutions for vibration of stepped circular Mindlin plates.

The exact solutions to these differential equations may be expressed in terms of the Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and the modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds. The governing homogenous system of equations is assembled by implementing the essential and natural boundary conditions and the segment interface conditions.

The model has been used to facilitate community development at the village level. The research illustrates the potential of drama and participative forms of theatre as empowering 'action' learning/researching tools to reach people in rural communities, and as a means of involving those communities in creativity and learning about themselves and their environment collaboratively. The writer seeks to integrate participatory approaches with community development and human inquiry, humanistic approaches to education, experiential learning theories, and drama education theories and methods. The central questions which this research addresses are : 1/. What are the functions and the methods of participative theatre (as systemic communication) in the process of social change and development? and 2/. How can these participative forms of theatre elicit whole aspects of local knowledge, that is, tacit/explicit knowledge, facilitate learning and foster critical thinking through grass-roots participation? The ideas were formulated and tested through intensive field experiences with Iranian nomads, Iranian farmers, immigrant farmers in NSW, Australia, and within a number of workshops with different groups of students at Hawkesbury. This includes a critique of rural development in Iran, examinations of rural extension from a critical perspective, drama and theatre as process, learning and conscientization, personal construct psychology, systems thinking, learning through metaphor, action theory, Boal's participative forum theatre theory, and action research.

Twenty-four simple criteria were distilled from these studies, and their usefulness in guiding the development and application of DSS were assessed in six FSR case studies. The case studies were also used to better understand farmer learning through models of decision making and learning.

Increasing mobility and rapid growth of road and air transport have been identified as key consumption issues, especially in relation to calls for deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Economics and globalisation concerns have dominated recent academic studies of air transport. There is a growing critique, however, of growth-based aviation futures on a range of ecological, resource, security and health grounds. This inquiry adds to that critique. Its primary research aim is to identify and articulate visions and policies for aviation futures within an ecological framework. Analysis of relevant literatures, including those on sustainable consumption, transport and tourism, is complemented by an analysis of aviation and tourism growth trends worldwide, with specific reference to Asia-Pacific and Australian data. A case study of the privatisation and expansion of Canberra International Airport in the Australian Capital Territory is used to provide a global-local link and to address the airport aspects of aviation. The range of visions and policy measures are finally considered within broad consciousness and frameworks strategies for the transition to sustainability. An important conclusion is the strong need for independent institutions such as policy bodies and think tanks - working in conjunction with community groups- to develop and promote policy discourses and futures visions that challenge the prevailing hegemony of the business-political nexus.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">commercial aeronautics, Australia</field><field name="subject">aeronautics</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects of aeronautics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of mutagenic agents to increase the protein content and improve the amino acid composition of sweet potato (Ipomea batatas Lam.)</field><field name="creator">Sedijani, Prapti</field><field name="description">The sweet potato has become a major international crop and it is also the main staple food for many people in the developing world. This crop is desirable as it is high yielding, easy to grow and has a low cost of production. However, the tubers have a low protein content and a low concentration of amino acids, particularly the aspartate amino acid. This has contributed to malnutrition in some areas. To help overcome this problem this study had the aim of producing lines of sweet potato with increased nutritional values. Two varieties, Beauregard and LO322, were selected for study as they have a good flavour and a high beta-carotene content. The conditions for the tissue culture of these varieties were determined by altering the mineral and hormonal composition of the culture medium. Increases in nutritional composition were induced by treating calli with mutagenic agents which included : colchicine, ethylmethanesulphonate, UV radiation and two levels of gamma radiation. Putative mutants with reduced feedback inhibition in the pathways which lead to the synthesis of the aspartate amino acids were selected by placing calli on media containing increasing concentrations of lysine and threonine. During the final stage of the selection process, calli were placed on a medium without the addition of selection agents. The results from the tissue culture study suggest that media, 2, 4-D and explant size affect callus growth. MSMA medium (a modified Murashige and Skoog medium) was the most suitable for growing the callus of Beauregard whilst modified White's medium (MW) was better for the growth of LO322 calli. The most prolific callus growth was exhibited by explants of the cultivar Beauregard when placed on MSMA medium. This combination was used to determine the potential of mutagenic treatments to improve the nutritional qualities of the sweet potato. Results from treatments with mutagenic agents showed that all mutagens used had the capability of increasing the soluble protein content of callus. These treatments also had the capacity to increase the concentration of aspartate and other amino acids. Of the mutagens trialed, a treatment with 500 rad gamma radiation appears to be the most suitable for increasing protein and amino acid concentrations. Therefore, once the conditions for regeneration of shoots from calli have been determined this study suggests that it should be possible to produce lines of sweet potato with increased nutritional values using this agent</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sweet potato</field><field name="subject">mutagens</field><field name="subject">amino acids</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual care of the dying : a community nursing perspective</field><field name="creator">Iverson, P. Dianne</field><field name="description">The spiritual care provided by nurses is not obvious. The literature on spiritual care within the context of palliative care nursing is sparse and contradictory. None of the research is from the Canadian perspective. Thus, this project examined the meanings made by palliative care nurses as they provided spiritual care to people who were dying at home. This qualitative study utilized the methodology of the naturalistic inquiry. From a population of 47 Canadian palliative care nurses who provided home nursing in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, six nurses participated in semi-structured conversations about their experience of providing spiritual care within the context of palliative care. Three major themes emerged : the nurses' focus of spiritual care on the time surrounding the dying and the death; the nurses' beliefs about spirituality, religion, and their own work; and the nurses' evaluation of their caregiving as evidenced by the 'Good Death'. The nature of the nurses' spiritual care was of guiding, doing the unusual, relating to distress as well as relating to the one cared-for with love and friendship. The nature of the spiritual care is discussed from the perspective of caring as moral grounding and cultural imperative. Consideration is given to empowering nurses through liberating the ethic of care. What the nurses know about spiritual caregiving is looked at through the framework of the art of nursing, the nurses' beliefs about spirituality, and the hidden work of nursing. As well, the nurses' evaluation of their spiritual caregiving resulting in 'good death' and 'death with dignity' is explored. Noting incongruence between the nurses' personal beliefs and religiosity and what they want for their patients, the author offers the possibility that caregiving itself has become the religious expression of the nurses. Implications for nursing encompass the education of nurses, the practice of nursing, as well as the inclusion of nursing knowledge at the policy and budgetary levels. Nursing education must change, from talking about wholistic care, to teaching how to care for the whole person by including care of the spirit in the curriculum. Nurses who have knowledge and experience in caring for spiritual distress need to share their knowledge and start the process of mentoring other nurses into the practice of truly wholistic care. As well, nurses must become advocates and educators at the institutional and governing levels in order that human needs, including spiritual needs, are included in the decision making about health care policy and budgets</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spiritual care</field><field name="subject">caregivers</field><field name="subject">death with dignity</field><field name="subject">palliative care, Canada</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teamwork in Australian middle management : a study to investigate attitude of team members, team member effectiveness perception and team environment</field><field name="creator">Finnegan, Anthony Maurice</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates Australian middle management teamwork in private and public sector organisations. The research sought to understand key teamwork variables previously overviewed in the literature, but never synthesised and substantially investigated. The main aim, and value, of the study is to bring greater clarity to business organisation teamwork in Australia by determining the variables that define teamwork, and creating a practical model for teams to manage their development. the research rests on a paradigm of post-positiveness, with a particular emphasis on critical realism.The main data collection methodology employed was a survey instrument. The selected paradigm of critical realism allowed a mixture of exploratory methods, and therefore team member focus group reviews were employed to triangulate and confirm the teamwork concepts extracted from the extant literature review. The results indicate that the research hypotheses were not all supported by the data. In general, the hypotheses logically theorised that people in the same teams in the same organisations shared the same attitude and effectiveness perception of their teams.

The relation between humans and tools is questioned, and the hybridity of words such as technoculture and biotechnology is investigated, arguing that the separation of human and technology,and body and tool, at the level of both existence and knowledge is a synthetic distinction. Specifically, the author concentrates on some of the medium specific effects of postclassical visualising technologies, from high-end ensembles such as virtual reality and medical imaging apparatuses, to the mundane apparatus of television and the remote control device. Such ways of seeing, it is argued, collaborate in producing an emergent tele-body, or a telesomatic mode of perception and knowing which exceeds standard epistemologies of vision in both science and the everyday. This work thus aims to develop a theoretical and conceptual framework for understanding the variable effects of postclassical technovision and televisuality upon our modes of embodiment.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">optoelectronic devices</field><field name="subject">technology-social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temperate urban mangrove forests : their ecological linkages with adjacent habitats</field><field name="creator">Yerman, Michelle N.</field><field name="description">Estuarine habitats along the temperate south-eastern shores of Australia are generally made up of salt marsh, mangrove forests and seagrass beds. In urban areas these habitats have been progressively fragmented as a result of population increase and industrial expansion. Salt marshes in particular have been vulnerable to urban expansion and reclamation because of their close proximity to densely populated areas, while mangrove forests have been less often reclaimed because of frequent tidal inundation. The effect of reclamation of salt marshes on the biotic assemblages and functioning of mangrove forests with an adjacent salt marsh, park or bund wall was examined at nine separate locations on the Parramatta River, Sydney NSW. A mensurative approach was used to describe the patterns of distribution and abundance of macro fauna at several temporal and spatial scales. The implications for management are that salt marshes are an integral part of estuaries, and smaller patches of salt marsh are just as important as larger patches in maintaining the diversity of faunal assemblages and ecosystem functioning in mangrove forests in urban areas</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mangrove swamps</field><field name="subject">estuarine ecology</field><field name="subject">salt marsh, Sydney, NSW</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thai women's experiences of HIV/AIDS in the rural north : a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Klunklin, Areewan</field><field name="description">Thailand is a nation of some 60 million people, 2 million of whom are estimated to be HIV/AIDS infected and, of those who are infected, 80-90% were infected through heterosexual intercourse and 10-20% are women.

It explores multiple dialogic encounters and different meanings of dialogue. It analyses dialogues within and around video technology and dialogues with contemporary events in Mexican history. The author argues that these dialogic encounters are contributing to an ongoing process of transformation in Mexican consciousness. The thesis&#8217;s theoretical framework draws on Mikhail Bakhtin&#8217;s theory of dialogism and employs a dialogic method that emphasises diversity. The author conducts an in-depth analysis of multiple series of dialogues between key people, events and discourses. The author examines the lives and work of a sample of the most significant independent video-makers producing work on the indigenous Zapatista rebellion that began in Chiapas, Mexico, on 1 January 1994.The author focuses on the discourses of independent video-makers looking at the indigenous Zapatista rebels and considers the indigenous uprising to be both a &#8216;political catalytic event&#8217; and a &#8216;multi-catalytic event.&#8217; The different dialogues looked at throughout the thesis reveal various processes of consciousness-raising which act in diverse, unexpected and unprecedented ways. The author argues that these dialogues have contributed to a crisis of legitimacy for the hegemonic power in Mexico and have also influenced the way the mainstream media operate, and their power within Mexican society.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dialogue analysis</field><field name="subject">documentary videos, Mexico</field><field name="subject">independent filmakers, Mexico</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amaranthus retroflexus seed dormancy and germination responses to environmental factors and chemical stimulants</field><field name="creator">Omami, Elizabeth Nabwile</field><field name="description">A large number of weed seeds in the soil persist because of seed dormancy, and depletion of the seed bank through manipulation of seed dormancy has been suggested as one of the goals in weed control. This study was designed to investigate some of the factors which control dormancy and germination in Amaranthus retroflexus seeds. Germination studies were conducted at different temperatures, and either in continuous white light or in the dark. Higher temperatures increased germination and, although light interacted with temperature, its effect on germination varied with the temperature. In an attempt to determine changes in dormancy during dry storage, two lots of seeds were stored dry at different temperatures. Loss in dormancy increased with an increase in storage temperature and duration, but the time required for maximum germination varied according to the seedlot. Seeds germinated to higher percentages at high temperatures, but storage at higher temperatures and for prolonged duration resulted in seeds gaining the ability to germinate at lower temperatures. Changes in dormancy under field conditions were also examined. Seeds were buried at different depths and for different durations and they all lost viability with time, but this loss was greater in surface-sown and shallowly buried seeds. Dormancy was broken during cold periods and induced as warmer periods progressed. The effects of chemical stimulants on dormancy and germination were investigated. The response of seeds to ethephon and nitrate were assessed at different temperatures either at continuous white light or in the dark. Germination increased with the concentration of the chemicals, and a greater response was observed at lower temperatures.

The VPN tunnelling protocol considered for the above study is IP security (IPSec). The main focus of the research is to identify the major performance limitations and their underlying causes for such VPN implementations under study. The experimentation and data collection involved in the study spans over a number of platforms to suit a range of practical VPN implementations over a wireless medium. The collected data includes vital QoS and performance measures such as the application throughput, packet loss, jitter, and round-trip delay. Once the baseline measure is established, a series of experiments are conducted to analyse the behaviour of a single IPSec VPN operating over an IEEE 802.11b infrastructure, after which the experimentation is extended by investigating the trends of the performance metrics of a simultaneously multiple VPN setup. The overall results and analysis of the investigation concludes that the CPU processing power, payload data size, packet generation rate and the geographical distance are critical factors affecting the performance of such VPN tunnel implementations. Furthermore, it is believed that these results may give vital clues for enhancing and achieving optimal performance and QoS levels for VPN applications over WLANs</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Extranets (Computer networks)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weight load carry : a review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the army backpack</field><field name="creator">Lehmann, Frederick Denis</field><field name="description">Military load carrying has occupied the attention of military developers, researchers and commanders over centuries. The Army backpack remains the means of carriage for ammunition and rations for the soldier in the field. The traditional rationale for its use has been that the infantry soldier must be able to sustain himself in combat and live independently for days at a time without resupply. At the Royal Military College, Duntroon (RMC), the mission is to produce men and women who are capable and effective officers and soldiers. The weight of the pack with the items required at RMC is often in excess of 40 kg. In evaluating the effectiveness of current practice, this thesis takes an anthropometric perspective in exploring the historical, physiological and social context of current loads carried by Australian soldiers, It does not, however, evaluate the content of the load itself. Research methods include: a/. Systematic examination of past research findings on the social and physiological aspects of military load carrying since the Roman Centurions. b/. Biophysical tesing of nine soldiers, using a battery of physiological tests to determine heart rates and energy expenditure at various loads. c/. A survey of 100 soldiers from the Royal Military College, Duntroon and in-depth interviews with a sample of four experienced soldiers to obtain the views of the load carriers. The research concludes that the optimum approach to load carrying, and so to the design of the Army backpack, is that it be task-and soldier-specific. This runs directly counter to the longstanding Army traditions of preparing all soldiers for every possible contingency in battle and regarding all soldiers as equivalent units. The study findings offer some specific directions in which the design of the army backpack can be improved.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">army backpack</field><field name="subject">backpacks</field><field name="subject">lifting and carrying</field><field name="subject">Australian army equipment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wholes, patterns and sustainable development : closing the gap between concern and action</field><field name="creator">Paine, Gregory</field><field name="description">The question of what comprises sustainable development is, essentially, a moral one: what should constitute the web of interactions between ourselves, and between ourselves and the non-human world.

Such reductionism is now recognised as an important factor in our current lack of success in &#8216;living more sustainably&#8217;. Thus, this research takes the alternate approach: a look at sustainable development from the perspective of the whole. The research reveals that even the complexity of sustainable development can be described, via patterns, in manageable &#8216;chunks&#8217; that can both retain the nature of the whole and advise of the necessary changes individuals need to adopt to close the gap between concern and action.

Workplace meetings emerge as a critical site where leadership potential is identified yet, it is argued, men and women do not meet as equals when they meet at work. The thesis includes an evaluation of the current literature on women's and men's communication styles, and the findings of the present study are discussed in terms of the extent to which they correlate with or diverge from existing views.

They carry on there,looking for the ways in which the wild music of the land be discerned and expressed in words. He talks with them about the business of writing the life of places. He takes heed of the natural histories in which their works have arisen, looking for correlations between those physical terrains - the actual earth, the solid ground of their work - and the terrain of these writers' prose, wondering how the prose (and sometimes the poetry) may be said to be an expression of the place. This work, in a sense, is a natural history of six nature writers; it is an ecological imagining of their lives and works and places. Writing the Wild is a journey through the light, the wind, the rock, the water, sometimes the fire that makes the land that houses the writers who compose these lyrics of place. Most of what it learns about those writers, it learns from the places themselves. This dissertation takes landscapes seriously. It reads the works of these writers as though the landscapes of which and in which they write might be worthy of regard in understanding the terrain of their texts. It lets places show light on works of words composed within them.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural history literature</field><field name="subject">authorship</field><field name="subject">North American writers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A nursery for men of honour : Scottish military service in France and The Netherlands, 1660-92</field><field name="creator">Glozier, Matthew Robert</field><field name="description">The thesis examines individual Scottish soldiers and Scottish regiments abroad in the second half of the seventeenth century, with particular focus on Scottish military service in France and the Netherlands, c.1660-92.

To test this, native speakers of Turkish (a language with a transparent orthography) and native speakers of Australian English (a language with an opaque orthography) were exposed to Spanish (transparent orthography) and Irish (opaque orthography) legal non-word items in four experimental conditions: auditory-only, auditory-visual, auditory-orthographic, and auditory-visual-orthographic. On each trial, Turkish and Australian English speakers were asked to produce each Spanish and Irish legal non-words. In terms of phoneme errors it was found that Turkish participants generally made less errors in Spanish than their Australian counterparts, and visual speech information generally facilitated performance. Orthographic information had an overriding effect such that there was no visual advantage once it was provided. In the orthographic conditions, Turkish speakers performed better than their Australian English counterparts with Spanish items and worse with Irish terms. In terms of native speakers' ratings of participants' productions, it was found that orthographic input improved accent. Overall the results confirm findings that visual information enhances speech production in L2 and additionally show the facilitative effects of orthographic input in L2 acquisition as a function of orthographic depth. Inter-rater reliability measures revealed that the native speaker rating procedure may be prone to individual and socio-cultural influences that may stem from internal criteria for native accents. This suggests that native speaker ratings should be treated with caution.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">orthography</field><field name="subject">visual speech information</field><field name="subject">transparent orthography</field><field name="subject">opaque orthography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of colonisation, cultural and psychological on my family</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Cheryl Dorothy Moodai</field><field name="description">This research is a story about the author&#8217;s Murri family.

There has been a rising interest among service sector professionals in examining the applicability and usefulness of quality management methods in service organisations. Many service organisations that have implemented quality management has achieved substantial benefits, but it is clear that implementation initiatives in some organisations have failed to live up to expectations. These mixed results point to a need to identify the factors that lie behind the success and failures of quality management programs. Empirical research in this area is extremely limited. The results of the study point to the importance of the role of employee support and encouragement of departmental co-operation for the successful implementation of quality management programs. These factors were found to be important not only initially, but also throughout the whole implementation period of QM programs. Another interesting finding is the relationship between QM success and implementation issues concerning internal organisational communication, corporate cultural change, and internal marketing. Significant differences exist in the way that each of these factors are practised and emphasised across organisations. Respondents rated the way in which they drew upon the culture, communication pattern and other behaviour to promote QM within the organisation. They also rated how important they thought these various activities were. It was found when these factors were emphasised in QM programs the chance of successful implementation was increased.

The findings and recommendations of the study aim to help foreign negotiators penetrate the important Chinese market through a systematic approach emerging from this Sino-foreign joint venture negotiation model. The thesis provides a holistic view on Sino-foreign joint venture negotiation. Case study method was determined as the best methodology. The suitability of the Sino-foreign joint venture negotiation model and the research protocol of this study were demonstrated via 5 in-depth interviews and a pilot test before the actual fieldwork. The major findings of this thesis suggest that foreign negotiators need to manage complex areas such as the Chinese environment, the company requirements of both organisations and the Chinese negotiating process. Besides, the foreign negotiators need to equip themselves with Problem Solving Attitude (PSA) and an understanding of Chinese cultural concepts, such as guanxi, face, renqing, reciprocity and trust so as to make the negotiation effective. Different strategies emerge at different stages of the process and there is no direct relationship between successful negotiation and joint venture outcomes.

The presence of a maximal iron supply is not advised because an excessive or unnecessary iron supplement may have biologically adverse effects, such as impaired immune resistance or negative interaction with other trace elements. All cereals and most vegetables contain phytate (inositol hexaphosphate) which can bind iron and zinc and reduce their biological availability. The amount of iron available for absorption in any given diet depends to a large extent on the composition of the diet, e.g., the presence of vitamin C and haem iron, and the absence of phytate. Rice is one of the most important staples in the Iranian diet and, in fact, rice, for most Iranians, is not a side dish but a main dish to which other foods or ingredients are added. An awareness of the effects of cooking method on nutrient content is important because cooking techniques influence the overall quality of a group's diet. The goal of this study is to determine the bioavailability of iron and zinc in traditional Iranian rice dishes and to assess the effect of traditional methods of cooking rice upon iron and zinc bioavailability. Iranian migrants residing in Sydney were surveyed in order to determine their food habits and traditional cooking methods, for the assessment of their effects upon the bioavailability of iron and zinc in Iranian rice dishes. Rice contains phytate, which is a potent inhibitor of iron absorption. The amount of phytate in rice depends on whether the rice is polished or not. The pre-cooking treatment such as soaking can also influence the phytate content of the rice. Soaking prior to cooking also reduced the amount of ion and zinc. The inhibitory effect of phytate is also overcome by adding different herbs, vegetables and legumes used traditionally in rice dishes cooked by Iranians. Herbs or vegetables such as coriander, parsley and cauliflower, used in Iranian rice dishes, increased the bioavailability iron and zinc. Results obtained from this research show that method of cooking, as well as the food mixture, is very important for the absorption of iron and zinc from the diet</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cooking method</field><field name="subject">nutritional value</field><field name="subject">vegetables</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radioastronomical instrumentation : the diagonal horn</field><field name="creator">Lee, Aizeret</field><field name="description">The horn plays an elemental role in the make up of a radio-telescope.

Longneck Lagoon is a shallow, man-modified lake situated in the north-western part of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia, in the Hawkesbury River floodplain. It has undergone a considerable change over recent years and at the end of the study was reported to have turbid water and no floating leaved plants or submerged aquatic plants. The hypothesis of this study was that vertical patterns in sediment characteristics can be related to biological, physical or chemical changes that have taken place within Longneck Lagoon and its catchment area. Assessment of inter-core variation within one area of the lagoon and between different areas was carried out and is highly recommended to others who may wish to conduct similar studies elsewhere. Restoration/regeneration of the previous diverse aquatic plant flora, associated with variable water depth in the pre-weir condition, would require the removal/modification of the weir, possibly reduction in the nutrient income to the lake, and, potentially, addressing mobilisation and internal cycling of accumulated nutrients which have accreted within the system.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Longneck Lagoon, N.S.W.</field><field name="subject">Hawkesbury region, N.S.W., ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regimes of truth : gender, achievement and parent participation in New South Wales public schools</field><field name="creator">Perry-Indermaur, Astrid</field><field name="description">The participation of parents in the schooling of their children has become a central policy objective of the education sector in Australia as well as other parts of the developed world. The discourse of parent participation emphasises a need for parents to be involved in order to maximise the benefits of their child&#8217;s education. Parent participation includes such practices as parents and schools working as partners to improve the well-being and achievements of an individual child to formal participation of parents in decision-making forums. This thesis approaches the issue of parent participation through a study of parent advocacy bodies as they deal with policy issues and interface with parents as the school level and governments at the policy level. The policy area of gender equity is used as an illustrative example to analyse parent advocacy bodies&#8217; structures and ways of operating. As a result of the empirical work that involved semi-structured interviews, observation techniques and extensive use of archival material, this thesis revisits the theory of positional goods as it reflects the notion and understanding parents have broadly that education is positional in that only few can achieve the highest levels of education and hence effort is exerted in ensuring their child achieves as highly as possible. This thesis argues that gender equity is caught in this thriving to capture a positional good that is elusive for most but appears enhanced by the use of adequate gender equity strategies. The action of parents within parent advocacy bodies reflected the fight over scarce resources that were perceived to be enhancing educational outcomes for girls at the expense of boys.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parent participation</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dynamics of lekh forest use in the Middle Hills of Nepal</field><field name="creator">Jackson, William James</field><field name="description">Extending Nepal's community forestry programme and its protected area network into lekh forests has been hampered by the assumption that people who live in or near lekh forests treat them as unregulated open access resources. This study tests this assumption by examining the interaction between local people and forests in two lekh areas of the central Middle Hills. The research is comprised of an action research approach, a theoretical framework of ecological anthropology that was also informed by forestry science, and tools and methods drawn from ethnographic fieldwork and rapid rural appraisal. The belief that lekh forests are treated as unregulated open access is challenged by demonstrating that there are clearly defined local use rights to lekh forests. Access to forest resources is regulated by forest users and relatively sophisticated and dynamic indigenous systems of forest management have been developed. The potential for implementing community forestry in the two lekh areas was explored by incorporating an element of action research in the study. A number of challenges are highlighted for the Nepal government to facilitate the improved management and conservation of lekh forests while ensuring an equitable flow of benefits to the people who depend on these forests.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lekh forests</field><field name="subject">forestry in Nepal</field><field name="subject">community forestry</field><field name="subject">forest use</field><field name="subject">forest management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a mature shame culture : theoretical and practical tools for personal and social growth</field><field name="creator">Webb, Tony</field><field name="description">Towards a mature shame culture seeks to identify new tools for social change through a deeper understanding of the social psychology of shame and guilt. The study takes as its starting point a suggestion by Richard Hauser and Hephzibah Menhuin-Hauser that many personal and social crises can be interpreted through the lens of a late 20th Century transition from a guilt culture to an 'infantile' shame culture. Implicit in this is the need to develop more socially mature forms.This idea is placed in the context of praxis for personal/social growth drawing on previously unpublished material from the Hauser's archive. The study then explores a theoretical framework for understanding the social psychology of emotions in general, and shame in particular. It draws on affect psychology, micro-sociology and social attachment theory. Shame is located primarily as a social emotion, with a normative function of monitoring social bonds between people - rather than, as it is usually framed, as a 'self-conscious', 'negative' and 'pathological'emotion. This reframing of the experience highlights the 'salutogenic' function of shame in building and strengthening relationships. In this frame much of what is commonly thought of as 'shame' can be seen to be the result of unacknowledged shame, where other emotions are bound to the sense of shame and carried as 'toxic' memories of unresolved shame experiences. This pattern of unresolved shame can be seen at the root of the personal and social pathologies of violence and alienation.The study charts how attempts to communicate this salutogenic perspective on shame led to an experiential education workshop Working with shame. It draws on the experience of participants in this workshop in a variety of settings (including anger management programs, workshops at men's gatherings, and community professional development training, and other group work). Interview data is used to illustrate how the masking of the physiological expression of shame, principally with anger and/or fear, interrupts the affective/emotional signals between people that would normally result in empathic responses an salutogenic outcomes. Finally, the study explores how this perspective on shame might inform social crisis-intervention programs at community level; and how it might be applied to the larger, and longer-term challenge of bringing about cultural change. It suggests key features that mark the transition from 'infantile' to 'juvenile' forms of shame and some of the factors limiting further growth towards shame-maturity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shame</field><field name="subject">guilt</field><field name="subject">maturation (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects of shame</field><field name="subject">personal growth</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transexperience and Chinese experimental art, 1990-2000</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Melissa</field><field name="description">This dissertation focuses on Chinese artists who migrated to the West (Australia, the United States, and France )during the late eighties and early nineties.

Indigenous people continue to experience unacceptable levels of disadvantage and social marginalisation. The struggle for indigenous students individually and collectively lies in being able to determine a direction which is productive and non-assimilationist &#8211; which offers possibilities of social and economic transformation, equal opportunities and cultural integrity and self-determination. The challenge for teachers within the constraints of the academy is to develop strategies that are genuinely transformative, empowering and contribute to decolonisation and positive social change. This thesis explores how the construction of two theoretical propositions &#8211; the Indigenous Community Management and Development (ICMD) practitioner and the Indigenous/non-Indigenous Interface &#8211; are decolonising and transformative strategies. It investigates how these theoretical constructs and associated discourses are incorporated into the Centre&#8217;s policy processes, curriculum and pedagogy to influence and interact with the everyday lives of students in their work and communities and the wider social institutions.

Eisteddfods had long been commonplace in Australia, but this competition began for political rather than cultural reasons in 1932, when organisers of the Harbour Bridge celebrations decided that since the spectacular edifice had made Sydney an icon on the world map, the city needed to cultivate a more sophisticated image. In observing events that led to its establishment, the project looks at the technological revolution of the 1920s and the social upheaval of the jazz age. This thesis observes that Sydney competition was Welsh only in name and grew from the political roots of the high and lowbrow debates that had come to divide society.

Finding the required information has become a difficult and challenging task. This is primarily due to the diversity and enormous volume of information available and the change in the nature of people now seeking information &#8211; from experts to ordinary users of desktop computers with varying interest and objectives. The problem of finding relevant information is further impacted by the poor retrieval effectiveness of most current information retrieval (IR) systems that are primarily based on keyword indexing techniques. Though these systems retrieve documents that contain those keywords specified in the query, the documents that are retrieved may not necessarily be in the context in which the user would have wanted them to be. This research works argues that exploiting the user&#8217;s context of the information need has the potential to improve the performance of information retrieval systems. Context can reduce the ambiguity by associating meanings to request/query terms, and thus limit the scope of the possible misinterpretations of query terms. A new way of defining context categories based on information type is proposed and this notion of context differs from the conventional way of defining information categories based on subject topics as it is closely linked with the situation in which the user&#8217;s needs for information originates. A new context-based information retrieval system where users could specify the context in which they are seeking information is presented.

The reduction of radium by photonuclear transmutation by bombarding Ra-226 with high-energy photons from a medical linac has been investigated. The irradiated needles would then be processed to remove the Ac-225, which can then be used for .Targeted Alpha Therapy. (TAT) of cancer. This project has the potential to slowly reduce obsolete radioactive material, and displace future expensive importation of Ac-225 from Russia, Germany (Institute for Transuranium Elements - ITU) and the US in the years ahead. This thesis progresses through a number of stages and begins by providing a background to the usefulness of Ac-225 as an alpha emitter, some of the equipment used in the experimental work such as linear accelerators and detectors, as well as the initialisation of a process whereby a reliable source of high-grade radium is secured, suitable equipment obtained, followed by a series of experiments leading to the production of the desired product, actinium and bismuth. The second stage of this study involved the formulation of a theoretical model in which the bremsstrahlung photon spectrum at 18 MV linac electron energy is convoluted with the corresponding photonuclear cross sections of Ra- 226. This enabled the total integrated yield of Ra-225 and its daughter product Ac-225 to be obtained. The third stage of this study ties the theoretical and experimental work together by presenting the results of a number of experiments performed on radium sources. These experiments were performed over a period of about three years using a variety of detectors in a hospital setting. These experiments, as presented in this thesis, demonstrate that Ac-225 can be produced in small quantities by a medical linac or in commercial quantities by the use of a high-powered linac or cyclotron, thereby, ensuring a reliable supply of Ra-225 for TAT and also reducing the radium waste product.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">actinium</field><field name="subject">isotopes</field><field name="subject">photonuclear reactions</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">radiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Empowering women in rural development : a collaborative action research project in northern Thailand</field><field name="creator">Sansak, Avorn</field><field name="description">The development policy and plans of the Thai government have emphasized economic growth aimed at 'modernising' the country, enacted through agricultural modernisation and industrialisation under the name 'rural development'.

It has been quoted,The hospitality industry appears to be facing increasing competitive pressures to improve the quality of its delivery of products and services. For many hotels, success depends largely on the availability of qualified line associates who are able to translate and consistently maintain their company's operational standards of service. Hotel companies, thus, must take training programs for front line associates seriously to accommodate the growing pressure to provide qualified associates. Consequently, many hotels now highlight training activities for front line associates as a means of providing an outstanding service for their customers. However, there is often scepticism about whether training actually pays off for organisations. Despite the importance of the topic, there appears to be little research on evaluating training for front line associates in the hospitality industry, particularly in the hotel sector. Therefore, this project is arguably pioneering in its analysis of applying the model chosen. It has demonstrated through empirical evidence the usefulness of the model to the four hotels in Sydney. This project has investigated evaluating training programs by analysing the reaction of the trainees, learning gained by the trainees, transfer of learning to the workplace by the trainees and training outcomes.

Animals frequently exhibit meat quality defects, including ecchymosis, at slaughter due to the stress of slaughter. This thesis explores how stress related hormones interact with adrenergic receptors to alter muscle and vascular physiology. Fallow deer were exposed to either a transciptional regulator (hydrocortisone), a beta adrenergic recptor agonist (clenbuterol) or a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist (propranolol). The administration of hydrocortisone resulted in a negative feed-back type reduction in circulating cortisol. Animals treated with propranolol and clenbuterol displayed less severe eccymosis. These results indicated that the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) is important in controlling ecchymosis severity. B2AR was also found to be important in mediating vascular dynamics, growth and energy pathways. To investigate how adrenergic receptors alter skeletal muscle gene expression and meat quality, an in vivo wistar rat model was developed in conjunction with in vitro muscle cell (L6) experiments. Gene expression of B2AR, its associated kinase (BARK) and collagen type III, prolyl- 4-hydroxylase (P4Hy) was measured in rat muscle and L6 cells. Following exposure to clenbuterol and hydrocortisone, growth and meat quality were determined. The L6 experiments revealed that gene expression following exposure to hydrocortisone and B2AR ligands paralleled the in vivo rat changes in B2AR, BARK, collagen type III, and P4Hy gene expression. In both L6 and wistar rat models the B2AR and BARK genes are similarly expressed following clenbuterol exposure. Both rats and deer exposed to clenbuterol had significant increases in growth rate and a reduction of intramuscular fat. The B2AR therefore appears to be a major mediator of many interrelated events including energy distribution, growth and vascular response to stress. Habituating animals to stress stimuli may increase their coping ability and improve welfare and meat quality.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slaughtering</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">ecchymosis</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">fallow deer</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">beta adrenergic receptor blockaders</field><field name="subject">hydrocortisone</field><field name="subject">clenbuterol</field><field name="subject">propranolol</field><field name="subject">meat quality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining service quality for homebuyers in the residential real estate brokerage industry</field><field name="creator">Seiler, Vicky L.</field><field name="description">The ability to attract and retain customers through providing excellent service quality is a necessity for any business in every field.

The purpose of this thesis is to identify the best instrument that can be used to measure service quality in the residential real estate brokerage industry. The findings reveal that the reliability, responsiveness and empathy dimensions significantly lead to increases in the overall evaluation of service the firm provides. The empathy dimension also significantly causes homebuyers to recommend the firm to others. Additionally, empathy significantly causes the client to use the firm again. Finally, as hypothesized, overall satisfaction leads to both repeat uses of the firm and recommending the firm to a friend.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">real estate</field><field name="subject">customer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="subject">repeat uses</field><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">empathy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A consulting approach to assisting Seventh-day Adventist Church Parishes</field><field name="creator">Steed, Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis is an inquiry into how a 'consulting approach' can be used by a church helping organisation in the Seventh-day Adventist Church system to assist local church congregations. This inquiry will focus specially on the service providers known as Conference Departments and how a consulting approach can improve the service they provide. The exploration of the methodology and relationship between department personnel and churches will inform this inquiry. Consultancy within the Australian Seventh-day Adventist church is in its infancy. For the majority of churches the concept of using an external consultant to assist them on an ongoing basis would be a radical thought. The Seventh-day Adventist church system has traditionally provided resources and training to church parishes via their Conference departments youths, Bible school, outreach, health, welfare etc. However, few of these departments have offered a true constructive service where diagnostic assessment and long term problem-solving occurs. This thesis aims to develop a methodology by which consultants can gain entrance into churches and offer ongoing assistance to them. The study attempts to establish a model and identifies the issues that relate to using such an approach.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seventh Day Adventist</field><field name="subject">churches</field><field name="subject">congregations</field><field name="subject">parishes</field><field name="subject">personnel</field><field name="subject">Bible school</field><field name="subject">assistance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/73</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experiences of grandparents providing regular child care for their grandchildren</field><field name="creator">Laverty, Judy</field><field name="description">Little research is currently available on child care arrangements involving grandparents, at a time of significant change within the child care sector. This study explored the experiences of grandparents providing regular care of their grandchildren prior to school entry. It used narrative inquiry, a qualitative research methodology to investigate the nature of their care experiences from the perspective of grandparent carers. Narrative tests were gathered through semi-structured interviews with 17 grandparents from a range of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds across Sydney and in south-west NSW, Australia. The active engagement of grandparents in the preparation of interpretive tests enabled significant depth of meaning to be discovered within grandparents' stories. The study revealed the grandparents held contrasting views in relation to their care experience. They gained significant meaning from building strong bonds with grandchildren, while also experiencing loss of autonomy, physical tiredness, and in some cases, family tension. The study found grandparent careers were not a homogenous group and identified four carer clusters grouped around grandparents' perspectives on family contribution, care obligations and personal independence. The study points to the importance of grandparents having choice in care decisions and the need to establish arrangements with adult children that are true care partnerships.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child care</field><field name="subject">grandparent</field><field name="subject">pre-school children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethics, human rights, killing, refugees and war : a transdisciplinary inquiry into the morality and human cost of contemporary warfare, with particular emphasis on prevention</field><field name="creator">Pattison, Raymond Edward</field><field name="description">This study is a transdisciplinary inquiry into the reasons for waging war, for fighting, and for repudiating war as an instrument of foreign policy. In Part I, its essential premise is that there are many ways for analysing the ethics and morality of war, and that to develop a comprehensive understanding of this subject one must be willing to engage with a broad range of alternate views. Though moralists usually argue about the rights and wrongs of conduct from within a given set of ethical ideas, the author's aim has been to move beyond the accepted boundaries of current philosophical argument.Questions raised include: To what extent is it morally right to adopt non-violent, pacifist or abolitionist attitudes?; How should the morality of domestic and ethnic wars be considered?; What are the human costs of war? Case studies such as the Vietnam War, the Falklands War, the Gulf War, Bosnia and Rwanda are used. In Part II, three inescapable observations add to the foundation of the thesis.First, war is not inevitable. Second, the need to prevent war is increasingly urgent.Third, preventing war is possible.Examples from 'hot' spots around the world illustrate that the potential for domestic war can be diffused through the early, skillful and integrated application of political, diplomatic, economic and military measures</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">morality of war</field><field name="subject">war ethics</field><field name="subject">pacifist attitudes</field><field name="subject">non-violence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extending integrationist theory through the creation and analysis of a multimedia work of art : postcard from Tunis</field><field name="creator">Pryor, Sally</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of the production of an inter-active computer-based artwork, an analysis of its research outcomes, and an exploration of the theoretical issues that influenced the artistic practice. The artwork, Postcard from Tunis, is an Integrationist exploration of writing and its transformation at the human-computer interface. It is set in a personal portrait of Tunis, a city with a rich history of writing. The thesis starts with the theory of writing. The conventional view of real writing as representation of speech is shown to have serious limitations.Postcard from Tunis offers users who are not Arabic-literate the perception that there are actually no fixed boundaries between writing and pictures, as both are based on spatial configurations. User interaction with Postcard from Tunis, particularly rollover activity, creates a variety of dynamic signs that cannot be theorised by a bipartate theory of signs and that transcend a distinction between the verbal and the non-verbal altogether. Postcard from Tunis both extends Integrationist theory into writing and human-computer interaction and also uniquely articulates this integration of activities in a way that is impossible with written words on paper. The research asserts the validity of the Integrationist theory of writing, language and human communication and of uncoupling these from spoken words. A framework is outlined for future Integrationist research into icons and human-computer interaction.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer art</field><field name="subject">interactive art</field><field name="subject">human-computer interest</field><field name="subject">art, modern Australia</field><field name="subject">interactive multimedia</field><field name="subject">Tunisia</field><field name="subject">Arabic language</field><field name="subject">written communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respectful relationships : an approach to ethical decision-making for gerontic nursing</field><field name="creator">Sinfield, Melissa</field><field name="description">Ethical decision-making is an integral aspect of gerontic nurses' experiences of caring for nursing home residents and their families.

As a result of interviews, the study revealed that nurses utilized an approach to ethical decision-making not previously described.This approach was identified as being professional, familial, collegial and reciprocal in nature.

Investigation as to the applicability of NIS to the identification from a barley breeding programme of the progeny with high malting quality potential was carried out over several harvests. The project concentrated on the determination of correlations between Hot Water Extract, Total Soluble Nitrogen, and Free Alpha Amino Nitrogen contents of worts (the extract of malt used to make beer) and NIR transmission data using the multivariate method of partial least squares regression. The correlation coefficients, for both calibration and prediction data sets, were significant and the standard error of prediction was similar to that obtained in the standard methods in the first year, but were unsatisfactory in the second. The instrument chosen for the study gave satisfactory correlations for the purpose of selection in the intermediate generations of the breeding programme with errors similar to the analytical methods, as long as a very wide range of calibration samples were collected from more than one harvest. It was shown that the use of an NIR spectrophotometer as a selection tool for malting quality within a barley breeding programme would not be sufficient to justify investment in this type of instrument for this purpose alone.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infrared</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">calibration</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A review of the environmental resource mapping system and a proof that it is impossible to write a general algorithm for analysing interactions between organisms distributed at locations described by a locationally linked database and physical properties recorded within the database</field><field name="creator">Hall, Bryan</field><field name="description">The Environmental Resource Mapping System (E-RMS) is a geographic information system (GIS) that is used by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to assist in management of national parks.

E-RMS has also been present in Australian Universities and used for academic work for a number of years. This thesis demonstrates that existing procedures for product quality and performance have not been followed in the production of the package and that the package and therefore much of the work undertaken with the package is fundamentally flawed. The E-RMS software contains and produces a number of serious mistakes. Several problems are identified and discussed in this thesis. As a result of the shortcomings, the author recommends that an enquiry be conducted to investigate *1/ The technical feasibility of each project for which the E-RMS package has been used; *2/ The full extent and consequences of the failings inherent with the package; and *3/ The suitability of the E-RMS GIS package for the purposes for which it is sold. Australian Standard 3898 requires that the purpose, functions and limitations of consumer software shall be described. To comply with this standard, users of the E-RMS package would have to be informed of several factors related to it. These are discussed in the research. Failure to consider the usefulness and extractable nature of information in any GIS database will inevitably lead to problems that may endanger the phenomena that the GIS is designed to protect.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental resource mapping system</field><field name="subject">geographic information system</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">E-RMS</field><field name="subject">mapping systems</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rhetoric of distance : a model of the visual narrator in design</field><field name="creator">Sweetapple, Kate</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a model of the relationships between the designer and their visual outcome that is intended to assist the designers understanding and management of the viewer experience. To date the focus of design discourse has been towards theories of interpretation that offer methods to decode messages, one of the more significant being semiotics. The application of semiotic theory to the field of design has enabled a greater understanding of how meaning is produced in visual communication, it does not account for how the designer affects the type of engagement the viewer has with the material which is a significant aspect of the communication process. The aim of this research is to develop a model of the design/visual outcome relationship that will assist designer&#8217;s management of viewer experience. To develop this model, the author examined literary theory as it is a discourse that has analysed its own creative process extensively. While there are many useful parallels that can be drawn between design and literary discourses, it is the notion of distance that is the most useful for this research. Through modifying the textual devices used by an author to create these varying distances, a model that identifies four types of visual narrators was developed &#8211; Idiosyncratic, Implicit, Imperative and Esoteric. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of the design concept of distance as a method of analysis for design and proposes how the designers might adopt distance method for considering the viewer experience during the design process, as opposed to leaving it to semioticians to critique post-publication</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication in design</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of families in promoting health behaviours in their preschool aged children</field><field name="creator">Roden, Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis explores parental health behaviours in order to develop a questionnaire which will measure the health behaviours of parents.

Translation is generally regarded as process of linguistic transfer from one language to another language in written form. Theatrical texts are an unique literary form because their written form is a base, anchor and springboard for the text in performance. Until recently, translation studies have tended to oscillate between lofty pronouncements which remain too general to be easily applicable to the practical task of translating and close textual analysis which may appear fastidious and overly specific. The art of translation has often wanted to call itself a science, thereby ostensibly increasing its credibility. However nowhere more in the context of theatre can it be justifiably called an art, with all that entails in terms of subjectivity, cultural bias and transitory or timeless validity. There is no such thing as a perfect translation. Translation is a process of endless learning. Several translation theorists have offered broad categorisations or lengthy rationalised lists to help define the parameters of this most tangible practice. No such lists exist which addressed the specific criteria of translation for theatre. Through personal experience and critical reflection, this thesis will offer the beginning of a blueprint which may be useful for translators working in this field</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jean Genet</field><field name="subject">Tankred, Dorst</field><field name="subject">theatre (philosophy)</field><field name="subject">translating drama</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Roman Catholic church in Britain during the First World War : a study in political leadership</field><field name="creator">Taouk, Youssef</field><field name="description">The political influence of British Catholics in First World War Britain has been a neglected aspect of British history. This thesis aims to address this deficiency by focusing precisely on the political role played by leading Roman Catholics in Britain during the conflict. This work concentrates on leading Catholic clergy, laymen and the British Catholic press. It demonstrates that the majority of leading Catholics were guided by an excessive nationalism which had two consequences. Firstly, British Catholics supported the war effort and the British government almost unquestionably. Secondly, most leading Catholics failed to give their full support to the Pope and repudiated his efforts to facilitate a negotiated peace. The thesis is based upon research into a wide array of primary material located in archives in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It depends heavily on the private correspondence of the Catholic hierarchy and leading Catholic politicians and publicists. In addition, it includes a survey of the Catholic press of the period, since it manifested the relationship between the leading Catholic clergy and laity, and the rest of British society.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">christianity and politics</field><field name="subject">Catholic church</field><field name="subject">World War I</field><field name="subject">Catholics in Great Britain</field><field name="subject">war and religion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of semiochemicals in Australian marsupials</field><field name="creator">Zabaras, Regina</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to study the nature and relative proportion of the volatile components in the sternal-gland secretions obtained from a wide range of Australian marsupials.The results obtained were then used to investigate the evolution of semiochemicals in Australian marsupials by using the current phylogenetic tree as a template.The initial part of the study was dedicated to the investigation of some of the techniques available for the sampling and analysis of gland secretions.

A high-concentrate low-roughage diet, consisting by weight of 70% oats and 30% lucerne chaff, when fed to horses was shown to influence blood red cell levels and blood L-lactate levels compared to three diets of equivalent energy content but reduced proportion of concentrate.

The other important aspects which were examined during this study include: developing a methodology for estimating of infiltrating characteristics, assessing the applicability of the Manning and other similar equations for flows in furrow irrigation, investigating the variation of shape factor during irrigation developing methodology for estimation of recession time and exploring the sensitivity of the models to the input parameters. Field experiments were conducted at Walla Park in northern N.S.W. and on two selected paddocks at the University Farm, Richmond, in western Sydney,Australia, over a period of three years. The validity of the assumption that the shape factor of advancing water front during furrow irrigation varies between 0.7 and 0.8 was investigated using field data collected from irrigation events monitored in the study. It was found that the average values of the shape factor varied from 0.96 to 1.80 at Walla Park site, from 0.56 to 0.80 at Field Services unit paddock site and from 0.78 to 0.84 at Horticulture Farm paddock site. The value of shape factor was affected by uniformity of furrow cross section along the length, the value and uniformity of furrow slope, furrow length and infiltration characteristics of soil. This means it is difficult to recommend a typical value for the shape factor for a given field situation.The performance of the models for prediction of advance and recession characteristics and runoff were evaluated using different indices of performance. In general, it was found that the Walker-HD and ZI model was the most satisfactory for the field conditions encountered in this study. This finding can provide a basis for initiating work on developing design criteria and management strategies for furrow irrigation in south-east Australia.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">irrigation farming (S.E.Australia)</field><field name="subject">irrigation efficiency</field><field name="subject">soil absorption</field><field name="subject">soil adsorption</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring postnatal fatigue : influential factors and management strategies for women</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Janice D.</field><field name="description">Caring for a new child is a significant, demanding, and time consuming role, often associated with increased stress. Postnatal depression is one possible outcome of increased stress and research has highlighted the importance of detecting depression in new mothers. However fatigue a correlate of depression, has only recently become a focus of research among health professionals. Understanding the nature of fatigue and its management within the postnatal period, the focus of this study, may reduce its impact on women&#8217;s lives. This longitudinal study explores changes in intensity, physical, mental and emotional dimensions of fatigue, factors associated with higher levels of fatigue, the impact of fatigue on women&#8217;s usual activities, and strategies for managing fatigue. Self-administered structured questionnaires gathered data form 504 women at 1, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after birth.

The desired 15% total solids in the nano-concentrate was achieved after three fold concentration of milk UF permeate. The colour of milk permeate changed, pH and mineral content decreased, and crude protein content, lactose content and titratable acidity increased. The lactose content was hydrolysed by enzyme lactase. HLNC was used to replace 25% and 50% of sucrose in ice cream formulations. Springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, adhesiveness, hardness, iciness, Ph and colour were not significantly affected. Viscosity, freezing point, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, gumminess and sweetness were significantly decreased, whereas freezing time, saltiness and cooked flavour were significantly increased. The overall acceptability of ice cream significantly decreased at 50% but was insignificantly affected at the 25% level. These results indicate that about one quarter of sucrose could be replaced by HLNC.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ice cream</field><field name="subject">milk composition</field><field name="subject">nanofiltration</field><field name="subject">lactose hydrolysis</field><field name="subject">milk UF permeate</field><field name="subject">hydrolysed lactose nano-concentrate</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring strategic alliance management issues in the financial services sector in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Kavanamur, David T.</field><field name="description">This study is premised on the assumption that because of increased globalisation the trend towards strategic alliances is going to increase in the 21st century. This is evident in the phenomenal growth towards the establishment of alliances the world over despite high failure rates. The study also makes an important assumption that a major cause of alliance failure is managerial in nature and therefore relates to the task performed by alliance managers.Whilst research in the West has attempted to focus on such failings, few researchers have attempted to understand the state of alliances in developing country contexts as well as the reasons for the lack of their successes or otherwise. This study therefore seeks to fill this gap by exploring the managerial issues surrounding alliance management in a developing country, Papua New Guinea. It was found that alliance managers in countries such as Papua New Guinea faced managerial challenges similar to those in their counterparts in developing countries. However, the similary ends there.The research demonstrated that governmental and socio-cultural factors predominate in the national and local environments.It also found that resource deficiencies made alliances highly susceptible to misalignment in strategic intent and structure.Several other findings are discussed in detail. The research resulted in the development of a holistic approach to the study and management of strategic alliances.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">financial services industry</field><field name="subject">business alliances</field><field name="subject">business management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Residential sector deregulation in the electricity industry : analysis of electricity consumption patterns</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Pavan</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis aims to improve our knowledge regarding the impact of privatisation and deregulation of public service type infrastructure industries. In recent years, Australia's industry reform policies have critically relied on rapid deregulation of major utilities such as telecommunication, gas and electricity. Although several industries have been deregulated in the last two decades, our understanding regarding the impact of deregulation on residential electricity market is still developing. In order to accomplish the research, about 400 residential customers were surveyed and their electricity consumption patterns (ECP)were monitored by installing special electronic meters. The findings are discussed in detail. As an implication to policy and practice there is an urgent need for a nation-wide standard,reshaping the practices of the electricity marketing and establishing a time-dynamic ECP monitoring system. Another important implication concerns the well-founded theories in micro-economic literature. This research has established that the price of the commodities and services charged by public service type utility suppliers should not be left entirely to the market forces concerned with demand - supply equilibrium. There is an urgent need to understand the role of different socio-economic segments in contributing to the economic efficiencies of public service type assets. More efficient segments should be equitably rewarded for their contributions rather than penalised perhaps due to the lack of their bargaining power.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electric utilities, Australia</field><field name="subject">electric power consumption</field><field name="subject">deregulation</field><field name="subject">electric industries research</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the International Auditing Standards and their applications to the audit of listed corporations in Jordan</field><field name="creator">Abdel-Qader, Waleed</field><field name="description">This thesis found that many criticisms were directed to the International Auditing Standards (ISA).

The URBS-Monte Carlo Technique(UMCT),has been applied to the Johnstone River and Upper Mary River catchments in Queensland. The thesis shows that the UMCT can be applied to large catchments and be readily used by hydrologists and floodplain managers. Further the proposed technique provides deeper insight into the hydrologic behaviour of large catchments and allows assessment of the effects of errors in inputs variables on design flood estimates.

The effect of pH and acidity on gel strength of the gums was determined. Enzyme was entrapped in k-carrageenan, gellan gum and milk fat and incorporated into cheese milk prior to cheese making. The cheese produced was tested for protein breakdown and amino acid production during ripening and textural and sensory properties of the ripened cheese were also evaluated. The findings and significance of this study and the literature review are presented. Gels were produced from alginate. Most gels showed reduced strength after treatment in solutions of either modified acidities or pH. There was, however, no significant change in gel strength between the different treatments for most of the gums. The activity of encapsulated enzyme were also investigated. Enzymes encapsulated in k-carrageenan, gellan and alginate gums retained higher activities than the other gums studied. Enzymes entrapped in agar gels had the least retention of activity. The retention of enzyme capsules produced from gellan, k-carrageenan and milk fat in cheese curd was investigated. Loss of encapsulated enzymes in cheese whey was also determined. Enzyme loss in the whey ranged from 5.6 to 17.9% with the highest losses observed with milk fat and the least with gellan gum capsules. Most of the cheeses treated with enzyme capsules showed higher levels of amino acid within two weeks than control cheese. After two weeks, all experimental cheeses showed higher production of amino acids than the control cheese. The addition of enzyme capsule to cheese did lead to a higher growth level of microorganisms. The experimental cheese exhibited lower score than the control cheese for most textural properties. The experimental cheeses were not significantly different in flavour and aroma from the control cheese. K-carrageenan treated cheeses were recorded as having the highest score for bitter after taste. Except for those cheeses treated with k-carrageenan capsules, the overall acceptability for the trial cheeses were not significantly different from that of 6 month old untreated cheese.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cheese</field><field name="subject">whey</field><field name="subject">capsules</field><field name="subject">gellan gum</field><field name="subject">milk fat</field><field name="subject">amino acids</field><field name="subject">pH</field><field name="subject">flavour</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">enzyme</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of microwave holography to the assessment of antennas and antenna arrays</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Tieren</field><field name="description">Gabor's original holography, which is the basic theory of modern microwave holographic techniques, is introduced. By computer simulations, it is demonstrated that the conventional holographic approach can be used as a tool to reconstruct aperture field distributions of an antenna with some constraints. Computer simulations of the theory and technique of the improved microwave holographic approach originally introduced by Rahmat-Samii et al. are carried out. The results show that it can be used for surface distortion diagnosis of large reflector antennas. The physical optics integral formulation is derived by general solutions of the vector wave equations. The necessary theory , which is needed to reconstruct the aperture field from near-field measurements both in a rectangular coordinate system and in a cylindrical coordinate system is developed. It is based on the plane wave spectrum and the vector wave modal expansion of an electromagnetic field. By using a simple dipole and other well-defined antennas, computer simulations have been performed. The results show that the technique is rigorous and applicable. It is also demonstrated that the sampling intervals and the number of sampling points should be chosen carefully in order to obtain a satisfactory resolution of the reconstructed aperture field. Furthermore, the simulations carried out in this work reveal that the real aperture field distribution of a dipole antenna has a maximum point at each end of the antenna. This characteristic can only be obtained at a very close distance to the antenna. This study also reveals the significant contributions of the evanescent waves to the aperture reconstruction. A simple but effective method for examining the evanescent waves from the measured near-field is also presented. By using dipoles and other well known antennas and antenna arrays, the experiments were carried out. The experimental results provide reasonable good agreements with the simulations. The technique proposed is effective and accurate.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microwave holography</field><field name="subject">aperture antennas</field><field name="subject">antennas</field><field name="subject">reflector</field><field name="subject">antenna arrays</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Centre of the storm : in search of an Australian feminist spirituality through performance-ritual</field><field name="creator">Rups-Eyland, Annette Maie</field><field name="description">The outward form of the text in which the spiritual search is housed is 'performance-ritual', that is, performed 'ritual'. This genre has its 'performance' roots in the dance pioneers and its 'ritual' roots in the Christian church. The contents of this performed text is influenced by an emerging ecofeminist consciousness. In this way, the thesis has a grassroots inspiration as well as crossing academic areas of performance studies, ritual studies, and feminist spirituality. The project begins by an examination of 20th Century feminist and ecofeminist writing on spirituality, which evokes the subjective, embodied and historically contextualised, with particular focus on body and nature. Additional concepts of place, holding and letting go are introduced. Particular performance-rituals are introduced under the overall heading 'the spiralling journey of exorcism and ecstacy'. They include earlier work, as well as work performed specifically for this thesis, Centre of the Storm. The study re-situates 'ritual' as a subjective, embodied and contextualised performed event. It challenges ritual discourse to incorporate 'spirit', and feminist spirituality to incorporate the material world, through 'place', 'family', and the ritual actions of 'holding' and 'letting go'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">feminist spirituality</field><field name="subject">experimental theatre</field><field name="subject">feminism and the arts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CEO characteristics, organisation characteristics, decision making and CBIS success in regional small business</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Douglas Bruce</field><field name="description">The research conducted for this thesis had two broad aims. The first was to provide descriptive information about the use of computer-based information systems (CBIS) in regional small business. The second of the aims was to examine the relationships among key constructs identified from the literature and to explore how they contributed to predicting CBIS success in regional small business.In the second phase of the analysis, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to examine the factorial constructs underlying the data. Constructs were identified that measured CEO characteristics, two measuring organisational characteristics, four measuring aspects of decision-making, and five measuring perceived CBIS success. Correlations among the constructs were examined prior to relationships among the constructs being explored using hierarchical regression analysis. The constructs were also examined in a single measurement model to determine their collective effect and relationships with the constructs measuring CBIS success based on structural equation modelling. Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, it resulted in the identification of relationships among key variables that predict CBIS success. The identification of items associated with decision-making processes, and the identification of the factorial constructs underlying the data is a major contribution to a portion of the literature that was non-existent. The final measurement model is also a significant contribution in identifying and specifying the relationships constructs measuring CEO characteristics, organisational characteristics, decision-making and CBIS success in regional small business.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business Australia</field><field name="subject">information resources management</field><field name="subject">chief executive officers</field><field name="subject">corporate culture Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of essential oil secretion in vascular plants</field><field name="creator">Gersbach, Paul Vincent</field><field name="description">A study of some aspects of essential oil secretion in plants was conducted. The first part of the study involved analysis of the volatile terpenoid content and composition of leaf extracts from a range of Australian native plants by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Secretory structures were studied by several microscopic imaging techniques including conventional bright and dark field optical microscopy, confocal microscopy, and scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. Three methods were employed for scanning electron microscopy. Sample material was prepared for conventional SEM by chemical fixation and rapid freeze fixation, and fresh material was imaged by environmental SEM. These methods were compared, and the images acquired by environmental SEM were invariably of a superior standard as the biological integrity of the samples was retained throughout, and the samples were free of process-induced artefacts. Several other tests were conducted and results discussed in some detail. In the final part of the study, aspects of essential oil secretion were examined by histochemical methods. The first of these was a new method based on traditional approaches to histochemistry. The monoterpene phenols thymol and carvacrol were located in glandular trichomes of Lamiaceae species by means of a colour-change reaction of the phenols with a nitrosophenol/acid reagent. The second used magnetic resonance imaging by a chemical shift selective method to locate, non invasively, the aromatic monoterpenes thymol and anethole in secretory structures in the fruit of Carum copticum (Apiaceae) and the leaves of Backhousia anisata (Myrtaceae) respectively.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vegetable oils</field><field name="subject">essential oils</field><field name="subject">essences</field><field name="subject">plants secretion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of governance and public participation in remediation of the Murray-Darling Basin</field><field name="creator">Dwyer, Brian James</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the question &#8220;What is the essence of the Murray Darling river system conundrum that is usually posed as an issue of environmental remediation?&#8221;- following perceptions of problems in catchment strategy formulation regarding project selection and public consultation.

An initial literature review indicated that previous examination of these topics seemed insufficiently radical or comprehensive for the enquiry&#8217;s purposes, seeming not to attribute full humanness to members of the public. A fieldwork program of quasi-anthropological nature was conducted. Interpretation of the fieldwork reports focuses primarily on the lack of attribution of full humanness to members of the public. Interpretive techniques including a phenomenological-style process was applied and found that the district houses a number of unrecognised people &#8220;nexors&#8217; occupying linking or nexus roles who exercise personal skills and initiatives to underpin effective remediation outcomes. Towards the end of the fieldwork program, further literature indicated that the initial four-facet nature of the enquiry should be reformulated, to include the overall nature of western society as it appears in the district (in place of participation), to reconstitute the concept of remediation more radically.

Both P. corniculatus and A. carunculata were found to be mostly canopy foragers with occasional forays into the shrub layer when food resources became available there. Flower-probing and foliage gleaning comprised the bulk of foraging behaviour. Most of the food resources used by these honeyeaters were seasonally unreliable and unpredictable, so that they needed to shift between foods and track them over hundreds of kilometres. A strong relationship was found between the densities of honeyeaters and the density of flowering trees at both regional and local scales. Sites on the western slopes were more important for nectar during winter and spring, while sites on the tablelands provided a greater diversity of foods over all seasons. When foraging at foliage, both honeyeaters were found to preferentially select Eucalyptus punctata. These two honeyeaters are very mobile and appear to cope within the fragmented landscape. Their ecological role as plant pollinators, seed dispersers and insect population limiters may have increased proportionally due to habitat fragmentation compared with less mobile species with similar ecological roles.

The focus of this research was about the practical aspects of using respirators in New South Wales workplaces. Two self-administered postal surveys were used to assess the level of implementation of respirator programs in 1996 and 2001. After five years, six elements improved. The most improvement was seen in the area of documentation including written procedures, keeping training records, recording respirator tasks, and maintenance records. The second survey investigated respirator maintenance and found little automated cleaning. Thorough washing was scarce with more than 50% of organisations relying on moist towelettes. For the third portion of the research methodology 485 used, half facepiece reusable respirators from 36 different sites were examined to determine the most common respirator defects. Maintenance and cleaning procedures were primitive and probably inadequate. Disinfection or sanitisation was common practice indicating concern about infectious diseases. The 2001 survey found that physical inspection of respirators in the workplace usually checked for the common types of defects found in the examination of used respirators. Weight, breathing resistance, heat and tightness were reported as causes of discomfort. The key outcomes from the research were that respirator programs were poorly implemented in a group of organisations that were expected to have more expertise than most and that the most common defects could be corrected by good respirator cleaning programs.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">respirators-Australia</field><field name="subject">industrial hygiene</field><field name="subject">industrial safety</field><field name="subject">respirator education</field><field name="subject">breathing apparatus</field><field name="subject">workplace practices</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian market perception of goodwill and identifiable intangibles</field><field name="creator">Shahwan, Yousef Said</field><field name="description">Accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangibles is one of the most controversial issues in financial reporting. It has been on the agenda of the Australian Accounting Standards Board, the US, UK, and the International Accounting Standards Boards, and the Full High Court of Australia. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has also placed accounting for intangibles in its Media Releases directed at specific companies. Evidence suggests that the materiality of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in corporate statements of financial position for a large number of companies is the reason for the considerable attention given to goodwill and identifiable intangibles. The present study has two objectives. First, it analyses the Australian market perception of goodwill and identifiable intangibles as assets in the determination of the market valuation of companies. Second, it investigates whether the market perceives goodwill and identifiable intangibles as wasting resources when valuing Australian firms. In order to achieve these objectives, the analysis initially develops and estimates a model (the asset-based model) that uses financial position statement items to explain the market value of companies' equity. This model examines the association between reported goodwill and identifiable intangible asset values and companies' market values. Given Ohlson's (1993) argument that companies' market value might be better explained by a model that includes a stock concept of value and a flow concept of earnings, a second model (the asset and income-based model) that incorporates an income variable into the initial model, is then developed and estimated. This model examines the association between the goodwill and identifiable intangible amortisation expense and companies' market values.

Playbuilding is a process whereby groups of students devise and act in their own plays using a variety of dramatic elements and theatrical conventions. This research explores the playbuilding learning experiences of two secondary school drama classes and the playbuilding teaching experiences of four drama teachers. The research underpins current drama and theatre education praxis that relates to learning through embodiment, symbolic creativity, and the purpose and function of metaxis in a secondary drama classroom. The study relied on qualitative research grounded theory techniques, focus groups, student workbooks, classrooms practices, closed questionnaires, face to face interviews and videotaped materials. Central to this research are the phenomena of imagining and creating that occur in secondary drama playbuilding groups learning through a group kinaesthetic paradigm. This study concludes that there is a paradigm which identifies secondary drama students as group kinaesthetic learners, and that kinaesthetic teaching and learning practices open up pedagogic spaces in playbuilding that significantly improve the effectiveness of group embodied learning in drama education</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">playbuilding</field><field name="subject">drama in education</field><field name="subject">secondaryschool drama, Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refounding governance : transforming the science to master the art</field><field name="creator">Cutting, Bruce A.</field><field name="description">Since Montesquie's incisive differentiation of the principal forms of governance and their components, the rate at which theories of governance have been proposed has exponenetially grown now when we have a plethora of different theories on the best way to govern, lead and /or manage. Anyone interested in this topic is confronted with many conflicting schools of thought, from Weber's theory of the 'iron cage' to Wheatley's new-age concept of leadership. This seeming maze of different theories can be seen merely as different perspectives on the overall embracing concept of governance which is essentially the holistic conception and explanation of differentiated purposive human systems - about paradigms and systems that have their inception in and are limited by, human mind. The core challenge, then, is to put some order and rationale into the understanding of this 'many-headed ' concept of governance. This thesis meets this challenge by mapping out a cognitive framework that is capable of embracing and ordering all the multitudinous differentiated conceptions of human governance experienced at the different levels of society. In essence, this thesis reformulates the concept of organizational governance in terms of the metaphor of the human mind. The cognitive model of governance are embraced by the different organizations in different circumstances and why this is appropriate and necessary, how and why governance changes over time, and how it is important to institute processes of inquiry, dialogue and reflection in order to know and choose more consciously. As a consequence of using the mind metaphor to analyse governance in Western society, the key conclusion is that there has been a substantial shift or evolution in thinking from a mangerialist mindset to the more abstract politicist mindset. This fundamental shift in mindset is pervasive and influences the perspectives taken at many levels in the human governance systems.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">manage</field><field name="subject">Webber</field><field name="subject">Wheatley</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="subject">human mind</field><field name="subject">cognitive</field><field name="subject">new-age</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/79</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constituents and their expectation : towards a critical-pragmatic theory of information systems project management</field><field name="creator">Brook, Phillip</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a theoretical model of information systems (IS) project management that aims to improve the rate of project success, estimated at time of writing to be less than 50% despite over thirty years of experience. The inquiry into IS managementand the development of the CED Model of IS Project Management presented in this dissertation were informed by critical social theory and pragmatics. IS projects are conceptualised as a collaborative undertaking by everyone affected by the project : the constituents. The model identifies the central role of constituents' expectations and their critical examination of the intended, desired and feared outcomes. By being based in the political, economic, technical and social dimensions of IS projects, this dissertation makes a theoretical contribution to the IS discipline. Furthermore, by establishing a set of prescriptions for how a project should be conducted by identifying who should take part (the constituents), how they should interact(engaging in the project discourse) and how the processes should be managed(driven by the constituents' expectations), the model provides guidance for IS practitioners to increase the likelihood of successfully implementing the project. From a research perspective, this dissertation presents an example of empirically grounded IS research, informed by critical-pragmatic theoretic concerns, that is highly relevant for IS practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">computer-aided software engineering</field><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">data structures</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavior of the expanded polystyrene(EPS)geofoam on soft soil</field><field name="creator">Zou, Yong</field><field name="description">Excessive settlement and foundation instability are some of the main problems commonly encountered in fills and embankment structures built on a soft soil of low bearing capacity.The Expanded Polystyrene(EPS)replacement method, by partially or fully replacing the conventional fill material with extremely lightweight EPS geofoam, may solve these problems.

This theory is investigated through hermeneutic praxis based on the theoretical perspective of phenomenology. In exploring how the dancing body experiences place, it is the processes that underlie and give form to dance that capture my attention. 'The dancing body makes sense of place' is a phrase that liberates the description and consideration of the non-verbal processes that underlie the dance/place interface. The phrase offers the possibility of communicating coexisting processes. Interpreted as 'the dancing body makes (sense of place)', the phrase suggests that the development of a 'sense of place' is an outcome of the action of dance. Whilst interpreted as 'the dancing body makes sense of (place)', the phrase implies the understanding of 'place' through dance. The hermeneutic praxis described in this dissertation, is comprised of memory retrieval sessions which allude to how the 'dancing body' experiences space, place and sense of place. During praxis, it emerges that the dancing body infers 'sense of place' through spheres of experience, that may be described as the; 'propriosphere, kinesphere, near-sphere', and 'far-sphere'.

Mobile computing has matured rapidly as a field of computer science. In environments of mobile computing, the mobility and disconnection of portable computing devices introduce many new challenging problems that have never been encountered in conventional computer networks. New research issues combine different areas of computer science: networking, operating systems, data and knowledge management, and databases. This thesis studies data and knowledge transaction in mobile environments. To study transaction processing at the fundamental and theoretical level in mobile environments, a range of classical notions and protocols of transaction processing are rechecked and redefined in this thesis, and form the foundation for studying transaction processing in mobile environments. A criterion for mobile serial history is given and two new concurrency theorems are proved in mobile environments. In addition to data transaction, this thesis explores knowledge transaction in mobile environments. To study knowledge transaction in mobile environments this thesis presents and formalizes a knowledge transaction language and model for use in mobile computing environments. The thesis further formalizes a framework/model for a mobile logic programming multi-agent system which can be used to study knowledge transaction in multi-agent systems in mobile environments and is a very early effort towards a formal study of knowledge base and intelligent agents in mobile environments. This work provides a foundation for the formal specification and development of real-world mobile software systems, in the same way as traditional software systems have developed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile computing</field><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">transaction systems (computer systems)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data base accuracy and integrity as a precondition for overhead allocations</field><field name="creator">Fechner, Harry H.

While the promotion of new cost management systems and in particular Activity Based Costing (ABC) has promised to address many of the perceived shortcomings of more traditional and long established techniques, the lack of its implementation success raises some concern as to the validity and value of these new system designs. A major purpose of this thesis is the development of a mathematical model that is capable of computing overhead allocations on the basis of organisational specific dimensions other than DLH.While almost all data bases suffer from data entry and omission errors, the information content contained in the data bases often forms the basis for management decisions without first confirming the accuracy of the data base content. The model has been successfully applied and tested to detect internal consistency and data element detail accuracy. Future research may test the applicability of the model with more diverse data bases to confirm its generalisability as an investigative as well as predictive model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical models-overhead costs</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">data bases-overhead costs</field><field name="subject">data base research</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of induced changes in foliar emissions of terpene-accumulating plants</field><field name="creator">Zabaras, Dimitrios</field><field name="description">Stress-induced changes in the emissions of volatiles from many economically-important plants have been demonstrated in studies over the past decade. Plants such as cotton and corn change both the composition and concentration of their emissions when subjected to wounding, herbivory and pathogen attack. Terpene-accumulating plants have been overlooked as potential objects of such studies although work on conifers has shown that species rich in constitutive defences can also exhibit induced responses. The aim of this study was to investigate whether terpene-accumulating plants respond to stress by altering their foliar emissions qualitatively and/or quantitatively. Species examined included Salvia officinalis (common sage), Melaleuca alternifolia (Australian tea tree) and Ocimum minimum (Bush basil). An experimental design was developed to eliminate factors such as leaf ontogeny that can affect the obtained results and complicate their interpretation. Small-scale solvent extraction and HS-SPME-based techniques were also developed; they enabled the quantitative determination of treatment-induced changes over periods ranging from 10 minutes to 6 months. Treatment of plants included mechanical wounding, herbivory, pathogen attack and chemical elicitation. Overall, statistically significant induced-changes were observed for both leaf-oil composition and concentration. The response of the different species used varied. O. minimum exhibited the greatest compositional changes whilst M. alternifolia was the only species for which oil-concentration changes were observed. The demonstrated changes were not as great as those reported in similar studies with non-terpene producing plants. The results indicate that the high metabolic costs associated with the production and storage of constitutive defences may be responsible for the limited induction of further defensive responses</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">terpene-accumulating</field><field name="subject">mechanical wounding</field><field name="subject">foliage emissions</field><field name="subject">herbivory attack</field><field name="subject">pathogen attack</field><field name="subject">chemical elicitation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a NSW rural property investment performance index</field><field name="creator">Eves, Alfred Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on the analysis of all rural property sales transactions that occurred in NSW over the period 1990-2000 and is the first complete state wide analysis of a rural property market in Australia. Previous studies on rural land performance have been restricted in both limited time periods and limited location areas. The importance of rural property, as an investment asset has been recognised in the US and UK with both countries having a rural property performance index. These indices are similar in construction, quality and reliability as the commercial property, residential property and share market indices that are also available in these countries to analyse the performance of these investment assets. Until the development of the rural property capital and total return indices in this thesis, there has never been a comprehensive and complete set of rural property investment indices available to assess the risk/return performance and investment portfolio benefits of rural property in Australia. The actual construction of the indices in this thesis have been based on the current indices produced by the Property Council of Australia for office, retail, industrial and hotel property in Australia. Based on the work in this thesis, rural property investment performance can now be compared to all major investment assets available in Australia.

In particular, the study focuses on the period beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s when, following the large-scale social and economic upheaval caused by the collapse of the once dominant pastoral industry (previously the economic mainstay and largest employer of the region), the policy popularly known as self-determination - and termed indigenous trusteeship in this thesis) - came into play. The former policy of state trusteeship, in operation since colonial times, was devised in more prosperous times (as a means to, among other thing, facilitate land and labour to pastoral operations) but was unable to cope with the quickly changing economic conditions. In an attempt to resolve the growing economic and economic crisis - including rapidly increasing unemployment, impoverishment and social dislocation - the new policy of indigenous trusteeship transferred the responsibility for the provision of indigenous welfare to a nascent Aboriginal political and commercial leadership. To assist in ameliorating the escalating rates of Aboriginal unemployment and poverty much government subvention, including land, labour and finance, was transferred to Aboriginal control and specifically to those existing (albeit on a small scale) Aboriginal business operations. In doing so, much economic space was opened to Aboriginal commercial operations, which, during the previous policy regime of state trusteeship, had been purposefully stymied. This thesis aims to tackle some of the misconceptions concerning the history of Aboriginal economic development and the course of an indigenous commercial class. As well, there is recognition of the major contribution made by an emerging Aboriginal leadership to the evolving policy of indigenous trusteeship. In short, there is a critical re-evaluation of the origins of, and support for, successful indigenous owned business operations in the Kimberley region of Western Australia</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal economic development</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal enterprise</field><field name="subject">indigenous trusteeship</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and application of trans-subjective therapy for older persons</field><field name="creator">Cathcart, Noel C.</field><field name="description">This thesis contends that older persons, whose mental capabilities remain intact, are capable of expanding their conscious awareness; they have not necessarily passed their prime as they begin the process of retiring. They may be showing a worn and weakened package but this does not mean they cannot live a fulfilling life. This is the reason for the development of a new form of therapy, called 'Trans-subjective Therapy', because it combines the objective and the subjective with the trans-personal, or unconscious levels of consciousness. Trans-subjective therapy connects the various systems of objectivity, subjectivity, and the transpersonal, or unconscious, so that the client can be facilitated into clearer, deeper understanding of themselves and others, and expand their conscious awareness in a wholesome, fulfilling manner. This thesis describes development and testing of this new therapeutic approach, which is designed specifically to enable older persons to experience more fulfilling and aware lives. Although building on existing therapeutic modalities, this new formulation is unique in that every feature of its design was selected, developed and tested with the specific needs of older persons in mind. This approach emphasises the personal responsibility of the client to expand his/her conscious awareness in the direction of personal choice. This has particular application to the needs of older persons, most of whom are at a stage in life where meaning and purpose have either become clarified or a sense of meaninglessness and resentment dominates their lives. Quotes from the transcripts of the author's testing of this approach with 12 individuals who undertook training in this methodology have been used throughout the text to illustrate the application of this approach. Its effectiveness is inferred from the manner in which each person in this group has expressed him/herself at a level of consciousness freely chosen and individually experienced in a manner that will be novel or completely new to the person involved.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older persons</field><field name="subject">trans-subjective therapy</field><field name="subject">consciousness</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">counselling</field><field name="subject">spiritual</field><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">emotion</field><field name="subject">cognitive understanding</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Buddhism/Buddhist</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and trial of a low-cost aerobic greywater treatment system</field><field name="creator">Okalebo, Susan</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken to examine the feasibilty of a low-cost aerobic system to treat greywater for reuse.Its purpose was to provide a system that would be easy to maintain, flexible and be affordable for households and small communities in developing countries.

On the basis of a longitudinal study of the speech of six learners acquiring English as a Second Language (ESL), this thesis investigates the proposals which have been made about variation in stages within the paradigm established by the Multidimensional Model (MDM). Of particular interest is the variational option hypothesis in Processability Theory (PT), the theoretical framework of this thesis. The findings indicate that these variational options and the variational features are not satisfactory in three main respects. They are based on a theoretical construct which makes problematic assumptions about the learner&#8217;s knowledge of the second language, they do not reliably predict variation and they exclude important aspects of variation. This thesis proposes a new approach termed &#8216;developmental style&#8217; which suggests that learner orientation at each stage can be defined in terms of a learner&#8217;s lexical or grammatical orientation. The findings demonstrate support for the developmental hypothesis and show that learners are consistent in their particular developmental style at the different stages investigated. The results indicate that learners vary in terms of their general grammatical development at any stage. This study also finds that language background, gender and task are variables which need to be controlled (informally) in order to demonstrate developmental styles.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">English language study</field><field name="subject">foreign speakers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diabetes: a gene therapy approach using genetically modified skin cells</field><field name="creator">Facey, Sandra Lee</field><field name="description">The long-term implications of deregulation of glucose metabolism, manifesting itself as diabetes is significant.

The advantage of this approach is that it may allow normalisation of basal glucose levels, which in turn may prevent or delay the onset of many of the complications associated with diabetes. The results confirmed that keratinocytes and melanocytes are able to process and secrete mature insulin from a furin-modified proinsulin construct, thus validating this approach and paving the way for skin grafts of genetically modified cells to be used as a possible treatment for diabetes.

Over that time a number of competing theories of dividend policy have been proposed, but no consensus has been reached about their explanatory power. This thesis examines the determinants of dividend policy of publicly quoted companies in Jordan as a case study of an emerging market. The study uses a firm-level panel data set of all publicly traded firms on the Ammam Stock Exchange between 1989 and 2000. Nine research hypotheses are developed, which are used to represent the main theories of corporate dividends. The results of studies conducted in this thesis suggest that the proportion of stocks held by insiders and state ownership significantly affect the amount of dividends paid, but not the decision to pay dividends.

Recent studies showed that this fruit had a high carotenoid content, especially lycopene and &#946;-carotene. These carotenoids are currently in high demand as they are natural antioxidants to prevent and treat cancers. Over the last ten years some new products from Gac fruit have been found on the market but the cultivation and consumption of the fruit is still limited. Gac is harvested seasonally and the post harvest processing has not been well developed. To make the best use of the valuable substances in Gac, this project investigated some processing methods to make Gac powder and developed the product quality analyses, potentially applicable to local small-scale manufacture. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the Gac powder process and some of the most important qualities of the Gac powder products, the analytical methods to determine lycopene and &#946;-carotene were developed and validated in this project. The new HPLC-based method included a liquid-liquid extraction, followed by a solid phase extraction before the analysis. Both newly- developed HPLC and SP methods exhibited a high extraction yield, good recovery and reproducibility. Compared with the HPLC, the SP method gives higher mean values and standard deviations, but it is quicker, simpler, less expensive and still reliable for industrial applications due to the use of less toxic solvents. The production of powder from Gac fruit included two main stages: seed removal and aril dehydration. Derived from the same drying operation, the enzymatic-treated Gac powder had a lower carotenoid content compared to the heat-treated powder. The Gac powder produced by the freeze-drying method had the highest carotenoid level and brightest colour. Finally the orange-red Gac powder with high carotenoid content was added to some foods as a colorant and nutrient supplement to illustrate its applications. The colours of foods were significantly improved and the carotenoid contents were increased after processing, indicating a potential market for the Gac powder.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gac</field><field name="subject">cucurbitaceae</field><field name="subject">therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">industrial applications</field><field name="subject">carotenoids</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing the Australian lamb industry using action research</field><field name="creator">Turnbull, Elwin Donald</field><field name="description">This document reports on the rationale for and results of using action research in order to facilitate development of the Australian lamb industry. The contexts of this research were: a lamb industry that had declining consumption; producers were slow to change to the production of new style of lamb which more closely aligned with consumer trends towards lower fat and convenience foods; and major changes in research funding criteria, towards projects with measurable impacts upon industries. The perspective taken in this research was that the production and marketing of lamb is essentially a human activity. Action research was effective in providing a methodology for working with extension and research officers using focus group meetings with lamb producers in South Eastern Australia. The key activity was the creation of an environment for a rich social discourse between industry people, focussing on establishing suitable processes and relationships within the industry. Valuable resources consisting of current industry skills, knowledge and institutions were utilised through this project for the benefit of the industry. This project illustrated a role for action research as an effective way of facilitating learning and communication in the lamb industry. The impact of the project was limited because the activities were confined to the production end of the marketing channel. The research helped the author to develop a deeper understanding of participatory action research and the close linkage between learning and self image. The experience of conducting the research validated the importance of the group dynamic in action research and the difficulty that individuals and groups have in matching actions with espoused theory</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">Australian lamb industry</field><field name="subject">lamb marketing</field><field name="subject">lamb production</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/84</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living with Hepatitis C and treatment : a phenomenological study of the experience of patients and their partners</field><field name="creator">Sgorbini, Myra</field><field name="description">Among the estimated 210,000 Australians living with the hepatitis C virus, over 80% will go on to live with chronic hepatitis C and its debilitating effects. Patients with chronic hepatitis C who have active inflammatory changes on liver biopsy may undergo combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin. Adverse effects of combination therapy can be variable in their nature, intensity and severity. They may be mild, reversible, moderate, or serious and life threatening. For some patients the adverse effects are so severe that it places enormous stress on partner relationships. Through a phenomenological approach using purposive sampling and semi-structured interviews of five patients and their partners, this study aimed to explore the issues surrounding chronic hepatitis C, combination therapy and personal relationships. The purpose of the study was to enhance understanding of the experiences of people living with the illness and undergoing treatment. The complexities that hepatitis C and treatment brings into the personal lives of people have led me to this study because there is a need to understand their impact on the personal relationships of patients and their partners. Through deeper understanding of their experiences, nurses can move beyond the medical oriented approach to treatment towards a holistic approach. The findings from this study revealed that chronic hepatitis C and combination therapy had an enormous impact on the lives of the patients, their partners and families. Both had significant physiological effects that impacted on quality of life, however, the social and psychological consequences of living with a highly stigmatised disease with an unknown course and outcome cannot be underestimated. The participants&#8217; narratives provided a rich description of their experiences and offered insight into the life world of people living with chronic hepatitis C and combination therapy, and their partners. The themes that emerged from the study were: experiencing illness and treatment; keeping a secret; sharing the experience; and enduring struggle. Nurses play a significant role in educating patients with chronic hepatitis C, advocating for them and helping them to achieve a reasonable state of well being. Nurses also have the important role of providing partners with information and support that will assist them as caregivers. The results of this study lend support to the effectiveness of providing equitable services to persons diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C. However, additional research is needed to explore gender, socioeconomic, sexual-orientation, transmission, cultural and religious differences within this group to better address their needs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visitor impact management in canyons of the Blue Mountains, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Hardiman, Nigel John</field><field name="description">There is concern that canyoning, which has grown in popularity in recent years, may not be environmentally sustainable within the Blue Mountains National Park. Sociomanagerial research was undertaken, using an initial focus group discussion and subsequent surveys. Canyoners were found to participate in their sport predominantly in small groups in relatively few canyons, were generally experienced, did not feel crowded by other people encountered, and displayed little evidence of displacement behaviour from popular locations. No specific biophysical impacts were perceived as serious. Canyoners generally supported management action to control visitation to canyons if overuse could be demonstrated, with education and/or restrictive actions as preferred management strategies. Biophysical research was undertaken to test a potential rapid assessment bioindicator for measuring and monitoring potential visitor impacts. Macroinvertebrate data were analysed and no significant difference in macroinvertebrate assemblage composition or water quality was found between high and low visitation streams. Macroinvertebrate fauna were found to be highly resilient to trampling. Current visitation levels within the canyons appeared to be within ecologiocally sustainable levels. The implications of the findings are discussed for visitor impact management policymaking.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental impact analysis</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">ecotourism</field><field name="subject">canyoneering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/9</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poor suburbs and poor health : exploring the potential of a locational approach to reducing health disadvantage in Australian cities</field><field name="creator">Gethin, Anni</field><field name="description">Poor urban Australians face a substantial health disadvantage: on average, they can expect to die earlier and suffer more physical disease, mental illness and injuries than wealthier Australians. This thesis examines the potential of one approach to reducing the problem of health disadvantage, namely, systematically intervening in disadvantaged locations. Such an approach is gaining support, especially in the United Kingdom and Australia; there is therefore a need to determine its possibilities and limitations. The thesis is written from the theoretical perspectives of critical social science and political economy of health. The research synthesises empirical data and critical analysis, combining findings from the health inequalities literature and analyses of contemporary political and economic contexts. It also includes two original studies: a quantitative analysis of the patterning of socio-economic disadvantage in Sydney suburbs, and a qualitative case study of a disadvantaged location: Mt Druitt, NSW. The health inequalities research shows that reducing health disadvantage is largely a question of reducing socio-economic disadvantage. A model of social exclusion is used to show how socio-economic disadvantage develops in capitalist societies. Following from this analysis, it is argued that a locational approach can have little impact on the macro political and economic antecedents of socio-economic and health disadvantage. Given these macro constraints, the thesis examines the possible ameliorative impact of a locational approach to health disadvantage here too, there are many limitations. A locational approach would have a limited population reach as most health disadvantaged people do not live in identifiably disadvantaged locations. Location itself creates only a modest independent burden on health, thus improving the amenity of disadvantaged locations will contribute little to reducing health disadvantage. In Australia, the creation of the most visibly disadvantaged urban locations is almost entirely a consequence of policies to concentrate public housing. Although it can be expected that locational interventions will be focused in these locations, there are substantial policy barriers to addressing the major socioeconomic determinants of health , low income, unemployment and sole parent poverty, in public housing estates, Location based policies to alleviate aspects of health and socio-economic disadvantage are assessed. In general locational policies and interventions have had a disappointing track record in buffering populations against issues such as poverty, unemployment and childhood disadvantage. Four specific policies are examined. There is a case to provide improved health services in disadvantaged locations. Measures to improve social capital or change the social mix of locations will have a very small, if any, impact on health. Early intervention in disadvantaged locations is rational in that the precursors of health and socioeconomic disadvantage occur in early life; however, population reach is limited and only the most expensive and intensive of these programs have produced good results. The case study of Mt Druitt shows that agencies are willing to implement a wide range of interventions to alleviate location based socio-economic and health disadvantage. Some of these interventions can be expected to have good results for some individuals. However, there is a lack of a systematic approach to problems in this location, and substantial barriers exist to creating widespread positive change. Overall, despite growing interest in a locational approach to addressing health disadvantage, and evidence of considerable energy at grass root level, a locational approach can be expected to contribute little to improving the health of socio-economically disadvantaged urban Australians.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban poor</field><field name="subject">poor</field><field name="subject">health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">social medicine</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological and economic evaluation of maize-based cropping systems for Nigerian smallholders</field><field name="creator">Omokanye, Akim Tunde</field><field name="description">Indigenous African shifting cultivation production systems, that were developed over many generations and took into account production potential as well as the constraints imposed by natural resources, are no longer practicable for Nigerian smallholder farmers. These systems relied on long fallow for fertility restoration after a period of cropping. Overpopulation has resulted in lower per capita land availability, necessitating a shift to sedentary cultivation systems. In such systems, fallow is short term (months) compared to shifting systems, where it lasted several years. This shift has resulted in overexploitation of land resources and despite intensification of agricultural production methods, non-sustainable demand on the natural resource base has increased and crop and animal production has declined. This study examined the performance of five maize-based cropping systems consisting of cereal-legume, cereal-cereal and cereal bare fallow rotations, to identify systems that have potential for increased agricultural production in the subhumid and mid-altitude zones of Nigeria. The study was conducted at Richmond, near Sydney, in NSW, Australia from 2000 to 2003. The trial investigated the effects of the combined use of legumes and N fertilizer in CSs to maintain or improve soil fertility, maize crop and maize storage silage production and yield and quality of all crop residues. This study showed that inclusion of a legume in the rotation is an important production and income generating strategy. Owing to their potential for increased maize productivity, to build up N-rich systems and to improve small holder levels of farm income, cropping systems with legumes should therefore be given more research attention in Nigeria</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crop rotation</field><field name="subject">rural land use in Nigeria</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing aquatic macroinvertebrate and plant techniques for the biological assessment of wetlands : a consideration of the effects of errors and implications for sampling design</field><field name="creator">Ling, Joanne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Rapid bioassessment techniques used for aquatic macroinvertebrate and plants in wetlands were tested in New South Wales, Australia. Wetlands surveyed ranged from coastal wetlands in the North and Central parts of the State, to tableland wetlands west of Sydney. Wetlands varied in dominant vegetation, hydrology, substrate and level of human impairment. Different options for sampling (mesh size, live-picking times, quadrat size, number of samples or quadrats) and analysis (taxonomic resolution, transformations, biotic indices, multivariate and univariate analyses) are compared to determine optimal sampling effort and evaluate the effects of errors or variability. Results show that, for wetlands of New South Wales, sampling procedures developed and tested in streams and other regions of Australia may not be the most efficient. Using the data from 21 wetlands in New South Wales, a number of analytical techniques were evaluated for the effects of errors. Results show that species-level multivariate analysis is more sensitive in detecting less obvious differences between wetlands (i.e., small effect sizes), while family-level analyses are more appropriate for large effect sizes. A modified waterplant index was developed that is simpler and has a wider application than the other Australian options available. Inherent problems in each index tested were addressed. The results show that the process of summarising a large amount of information into a single value will result in the loss of both information and variability between samples and this cumulative effect of error may effect the assessment of wetland condition. The practical outcome of this thesis is a set of standardised steps to assess wetland quality using biological assemblages. The results show that protocols and indices for rivers are not directly transferable to palustrine, vegetation dominated wetlands. I present protocols that are more appropriate to wetlands and recognise that each protocol would need to be adapted for each wetland type. Despite the need for flexible protocols, I promote the need for a standard approach to wetland sampling and the need for consideration of the effects of errors in sampling designs. This study highlights the need for more research on the response of specific stressors to wetlands flora and fauna. The results from this study also show that wetland macroinvertebrates and plant communities can be used as surrogates in multivariate analyses for detecting large differences between wetlands (wetland types) but that impact assessment requires more detailed investigations including species identification and careful consideration of the choice of reference and control sites. In conclusion I emphasise the need for scientific rigour in the use of biological indicators and consideration of the effects of errors and implications to sampling designs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wetlands research</field><field name="subject">environmental sampling</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">biological assessment</field><field name="subject">wetland ecology</field><field name="subject">indicators (biology)</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental toughness : conceptualisation and measurement</field><field name="creator">Middleton, Simon C.</field><field name="description">Major challenges facing sport psychology researchers, practitioners, coaches, and athletes include understanding mental toughness and knowing how to train for it. Athletes and coaches have long identified mental toughness as an important attribute for performance. Practitioners have devised training approaches for mental toughness&#8212;often based on anecdotal notions of what mental toughness is and how it should be developed. The research available on mental toughness is scarce, with only a few recent but limited advances. Fundamental to the challenge of understanding and training mental toughness, there is a critical need for research to develop a model of mental toughness that is not based on anecdote, but rather on sound research methods and theoretical underpinnings. Following on from conceptualisation, there is a need to develop an instrument to measure mental toughness. Taken together, a conceptual model and a measurement approach are the tools needed by researchers to develop and test mental toughness training programs. The purpose of this thesis was to address some of these issues by capitalising on the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative methods to: (a) critically examine a popular test of mental toughness; (b) determine specific characteristics of mental toughness and understand the interrelationship between those characteristics; (c) develop a model of mental toughness that draws together specific characteristics; (d) produce a mental toughness definition; (e) develop the Mental Toughness Inventory, a robust and valid instrument that demonstrates a sound factor structure, strong reliabilities, and invariance across gender, age, and level of competition (i.e., demonstrating within-network validity); and (f) determine the relative congruence between scores on the Mental Toughness Inventory and theoretically related constructs (i.e., demonstrating between-network validity). In line with these aims, Study 1 evaluated the psychometric properties of an existing, popular, and yet unsubstantiated test of mental toughness&#8212;the Psychological Performance Inventory (PPI). Given the breadth and depth of mental toughness as evidenced by the literature, the PPI was not expected to provide a reasonable model. Instead, the study was intended to inform the researcher on the psychometric strengths of the PPI and guide the development of a new measure of mental toughness throughout the remainder of the thesis. The PPI was examined using both within-network and between-network validity checks and responses from 263 student-athletes in Years 7&#8211;12 (12 to 19 years of age). Study 2 was a qualitative study that examined the interview data of over 30 elite sportspeople to determine the characteristics of mental toughness. The purpose of this study was to develop a conceptual model and definition of mental toughness that draws together all the characteristics in a way that adds meaning and clarity to the concept. The purpose of Studies 3 and 4 was to construct, refine, and validate the Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI)&#8212;a measure of mental toughness emanating from the findings of Studies 1 and 2. Studies 3 and 4 critically examined the construct validity of the MTI using both within-network and between-network validation on the basis of responses from institution-based athletes (from sports programs such as those run by the Australian Institute of Sport) and school-based athletes (from a selective sports high school). Furthermore, Studies 3 and 4 provided the scope to examine invariance of the mental toughness factor structure across groups, group mean-level differences, and interaction effects. The results of Study 1 provided a number of insights into the status of the PPI, raised an interesting conundrum regarding the interface between conceptualisation and instrumentation, and provided guidance for instrument development that would become the empirical basis of subsequent quantitative studies. The qualitative results of Study 2 unearthed a multidimensional model of mental toughness, containing 12 first-order factors each of which contribute to a higher order (or Global) mental toughness factor. The 12 mental toughness characteristics identified are: self-efficacy, potential, mental self-concept, value, personal bests, commitment, stress minimisation, perseverance, positive comparisons, positivity, task familiarity, and task focus. Study 3 involved the construction of the Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI), with results revealing excellent validity from a within-network perspective (including confirmatory factor analysis, goodness of fit, internal reliability, and invariance across groups). Study 4 results revealed that MTI factors correlated more strongly with theoretically-related concepts and less strongly with unrelated concepts&#8212;thus demonstrating between-network validity (convergent and discriminant). Study 4 also revealed a number of significant main effects of age (favouring older athletes), gender (favouring male athletes) and group (a contextual effect where institution-based athletes rate themselves more &#8213;rigorously relative to strong contextual effects, which need to be carefully considered when assessing and developing mental toughness. For sporting organisations, this research points to a number of things that can be done at an institutional level&#8212;particularly in relation to creating an environment that is most likely to facilitate the positive development of various components of mental toughness. Finally, for research and continued theorising about mental toughness, the findings from this thesis support viewing mental toughness as a combination of cognitive, behavioural, and emotive processes that work together in combating adversity or pressure. Taken together, the conceptualising and empirical works conducted in this study are proposed to advance the field of research&#8212;creating opportunities to study the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance mental toughness. Furthermore, the results provide practitioners, coaches, and athletes with a concrete understanding of mental toughness such that they are better equipped to devise training approaches and to handle pressure and adversity en route to athletic success.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">physical education and training</field><field name="subject">athletes</field><field name="subject">training of</field><field name="subject">mental discipline</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The book is open but you can't turn the page: parents' perceptions of early childhood service quality</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Roslyn</field><field name="description">This research examines parents&#8217; perceptions of quality on early childhood services as they support families in the care and education of children.

The focus is on the year 1917 during the First World War and the Radical publicist&#8217;s belief in the necessity of a negotiated settlement as an essential ingredient to achieving a just and lasting peace. These publicists also believed that the United States could play a unique role in mediating an end to the war and reforming the international system. Radical publicists tirelessly campaigned for a revision of Allied war aims and were convinced that alliances, the arms race, secret diplomacy, imperialism and militarism, played a large part in the outbreak of war and its prolongation. They believed that when the peace settlement came, it should not be a peace of vengeance but a just peace that addressed these flaws in the international system. The Radical publicists looked increasingly to the American President Wilson for leadership, while Wilson was drawn to the Radical publicist&#8217;s progressive internationalist ideas, particularly the concept of a league of nations. The Conclusion examines the reason for the failure of the Wilsonian strategy to achieve a just and lasting peace in 1919, but points to the enduring legacy of the Radical publicist&#8217;s ideas about creating a stable world order.

The thesis itself takes the form of a story being told, the story of a therapist, his client, and his clinical supervisor.The story of these relationships is used to argue that stories are told more to create something (a relationship) and forge something (a more vital connection to an animating world) than to communicate something.The author draws on both a philosophical, and a psychoanalytical tradition to show what he suggest are more vital ways of thinking about human behaviour in general and the therapeutic encounter in particular.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychotherapy (Australia)</field><field name="subject">storytelling therapy</field><field name="subject">personal construct therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/93</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the prevalence, experience and nature of child-to-mother violence in a high-risk geographical area</field><field name="creator">Edenborough, Michel A.</field><field name="description">In this research the prevalence, experiences and nature of child-to-mother violence from a high-risk geographical area were investigated. The aims of the study were to identify these factors within contemporary communities and develop validated recommendations for interventions to support affected mothers, children and families. This form of family pathology has been positioned within juvenile justice and medical models rather than family violence literature. It appears to be poorly understood, underreported and hidden from public view. Thus, it was difficult for some affected women to recognise what they were experiencing as abuse. In the literature, mothers were reported as the primary targets of violence and sons the predominant perpetrators. Incidence rates varied widely from samples collected 30 to 40 years ago. Other anomalies in the literature revealed power in mother-child relationships to be unclear, and the gender of targets of violence and perpetrators was not made explicit in the literature. In this study a mixed method design was used over four distinct phases: (1) development and validation of an instrument; (2) conducting a pilot study; and (3) population study; and (4) workshop with service providers. Psychometric tests on the instrument indicated a 0.97 correlation coefficient on a test re-test, and Cronbach&#8217;s alpha achieved correlation coefficient of 0.91 for the 24 item scale and 0.99 correlation coefficient for the 17 item scale. Results signify prevalence of child-to-mother violence in 50.9% [n = 1024] of the households surveyed. Key findings indicate 50.3% [n=521] of women were afraid in their family of origin, and 39.2% [n=521] of children had been witness to violence in the home previously. In addition, younger mothers experienced greater child-to-mother violence; as women&#8217;s level of education increased, their experience of child-to-mother violence decreased; single mothers experienced greater child-to-mother violence; and were more likely to live in households with access to casual employment or were unemployed. Perpetrators were predominantly sons, 58.7% [n = 521]. Half of the women who experienced child-to-mother violence spoke to someone; and experiences for women with a partner present in the home were divided between supportive and unsupportive behaviour from the partner. The most popular suggestions for support were affordable long-term counselling for youth and family, parent workshops, information and education, non-judgemental advocacy for mothers and their families, support groups for mothers, families and youth and peer mentorship programs. Women made salient their experiences related to child-to-mother violence which revealed the seriousness and complexity of this issue for women. As a result five key themes were developed: (1) Living in the red zone: The experience of child-to-mother violence, this theme referred to women&#8217;s sense of danger and difficulty in rasing an abusive child; (2) The damage is done: The breakdown of relationships, which described the breakdown and discord within relationships after experiencing child-to-mother violence; (3) Order out of chaos: Successful transition back into the family; identified the re-integration of relationships between the child/ren and mother; (4) Falling through the cracks: Barriers to service provision, drew attention to the difficulties women faced trying to access appropriate services; and, (5) Cry for help: Where to from here?, focused on suggestions by the mothers for support services. A workshop consultation with service providers revealed a number of broad recommendations: (1) Zero tolerance for violence, young people taking responsibility for violence; (2) Awareness of child-to-mother violence campaign; (3) Information and education packages; (4) Case management approach for families utilising services; (5) Co-operation between service providers; (6) 24 hour telephone service for advice; (7) Women centred support groups and group interventions; (8) Respite care; (9) Specialised counselling services; and (10) Mentoring programs. This study supported the view that power is a complex issue, particularly for women experiencing child-to-mother violence. Women developed feelings of ambiguity for their abusive child owing to resentment that built up for the child targeting them with abuse at the same time sympathising with the child for their particular circumstances. Providing support for women must be a priority. Key suggestions for support include: raising awareness through information and education packages, emergency phone support, building relationships, women centred support groups and peer mentoring.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">family violence</field><field name="subject">abused women</field><field name="subject">services for</field><field name="subject">mother and child</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What do RNs working in hospital aged care units identify as the positive and negative aspects of aged care nursing?</field><field name="creator">Geoghegan, John</field><field name="description">This study reports the positive and negative aspects identified by registered nurses (RNs) working with older people in public hospital aged care units and was conducted in 4 public hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Qualitative data using questionnaires and telephone interviews was collected from 26 female and 4 male RNs of which 46% (n 14) had worked in an aged care unit for 10 years or more. The participants identified positive perceptions within three major themes: a genuine liking of older people; the stories older people tell and the complexity of the older patient&#8217;s illnesses. Positive responses were a focus as it was identified that this was a gap in the literature which required addressing at the time. These findings are significant and have implications for nursing practice for several reasons: Data was collected exclusively from RNs and focused on their positive perceptions about aged care nursing in public hospitals. Participants reported a genuine liking for older people. Patients&#8217; telling their stories was reported by 60% (n 18) of participants as being interesting in their work and meaningful to the patient and should be considered more as a therapeutic process during hospitalisation to assist support and enhance patient outcomes and therapy. The participants reported that aged care nursing is complex, rewarding and requires mature nurses, with current nursing knowledge and skilled in the art of caring for older people. These findings can be used to improve recruitment and retention of RNs within aged care nursing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">medical care surveys</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achieving equity in educational outcomes for students with chronic illness</field><field name="creator">Shiu, Shiona</field><field name="description">This portfolio documents an investigation of both parent and educator perspectives of managing a chronic illness at school with the aim of developing a framework to ensure that students with chronic illness have equitable access to the same educational outcomes as their healthy peers. This study provides an in-depth exploration of a number of facets of the impact of having a chronic illness, including social, emotional, cognitive and physical aspects. The use of both parent and teacher perspectives provides insights into the realities of having a child with chronic illness at school, and offers some understandings of the risks and challenges parents face as they relinquish care of their ill child into the hands of educators. It also examines the role of educators as they assume much of the responsibility for providing educational, social and emotional support for these students, as well as monitoring their medical needs and health status whilst at school. The evidence from research in the field of child chronic illness suggests that students with chronic illness are at risk academically, emotionally and socially. The effectiveness of any strategy that aims to achieve equity in participation and outcomes for this group of students will depend upon understanding the complex factors that impact on students with chronic illness at school such as absenteeism, relationships with peers and individual resilience. This study addresses the research questions: What are the concerns of parents, educators and students with chronic illness in the educational context? What strategies are consistently being identified as effective in supporting students with a chronic illness at school? And what are the barriers to chronically ill students accessing educational services? Two, two part questionnaires were used to elicit responses from parents and educators of students with chronic illness. The parent respondents consisted of 121 parents of students with chronic illness attending Department of Education schools across NSW, Australia. The teacher respondents consisted of 111 teachers of students with chronic illness in Department of Education schools across NSW. The insights that emerged from the research suggest that the needs of this group of students remain unrecognised and under-resourced. Major findings indicate that many students with chronic illness have high levels of absenteeism, are underachieving academically, have difficulties keeping up and catching up with missed school work, are challenged in their relationships with their peers, and their medical needs are not recognised nor resourced adequately. Teachers of students with chronic illness are inadequately trained, and lack the time and resources to meet the individual needs of these students. The results demonstrated that students with chronic illness are not accessing educational services in the same ways as their healthy peers. The findings of this study suggest schools can make a difference to how well a student and a family cope with chronic illness. The provision of appropriate support, resources and the demonstration of positive attitudes by school communities can foster an environment that facilitates the academic and social growth of the student. The study includes recommendations in the areas of: building communication between home, school and medical professionals; maintaining academic achievement; building peer relationships; managing student medical needs; supporting students returning to school; reducing absenteeism; and supporting emotional health of student and family. The findings of this study have raised an awareness of the needs of students with chronic illness at school, and identified strategies for their support and inclusion. The findings also provide a framework for the provision of educational services for students with chronic illness. Hence, this portfolio represents an exploration of the journey much traveled by parents and educators of students with a chronic illness, with the intent of raising awareness of their needs, and providing direction for policy makers in the field of education, to ensure that students with chronic illness have equitable access to the same educational outcomes as their healthy peers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronically ill children</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">services for</field><field name="subject">school attendance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian deterritorialised music theatre : a theoretical and creative exploration</field><field name="creator">Bonshek, Corrina</field><field name="description">This project consists of a theoretical examination of Australian music theatre and a portfolio of musical compositions. The thesis proposes an innovative analytical model for music theatre/multi-media with a distinctive perspective. Adapting concepts from feminist Deleuzean theorists, it advances a notion of feminine difference that moves beyond earlier debates between essentialists and anti-essentialists. This theoretical framework guides the close examination of three works &#8213; Andr&#233;e Greenwell&#8217;s Laquiem: Tales from the Mourning of the Lac Women (1999), Greenwell&#8217;s Laquiem (2002) and Gretchen Miller&#8217;s Inland (1999/2000) &#8213; that complicate the category &#8216;music theatre&#8217; in the way that they cross genre boundaries. Greenwell&#8217;s Laquiem: Tales from the Mourning of the Lac Women is a new music performance work based upon Kathleen Mary Fallon&#8217;s &#8216;The Mourning of the Lac Women&#8217;. This work has a close relationship to Laquiem (2002), a short film directed, composed and scripted adapted by Greenwell based upon the same text by Fallon. Inland is a radiophonic work that Miller also staged as a live performance. The thesis argues that changing format and interdisciplinary content of works such as these has contributed to the current proliferation of genre labels. Recent works can be defined under various descriptors such as &#8216;performance art&#8217;, &#8216;documentary opera&#8217; or &#8216;installation performance&#8217;. The thesis offers the concept of &#8216;deterritorialised music theatre&#8217; to address works that exist at and beyond the limits of music theatre as a category. The penultimate chapter applies a Deleuzean feminist framework to the composition portfolio submitted with the thesis. The creative work consists of two audio-visual installations (one with quadraphonic sound), a music-theatre work (exploring &#8216;action&#8217;- instrumental possibilities) and a music-art tour that includes music for string trio, singer and brass/sax septet.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music and philosophy</field><field name="subject">musical theater</field><field name="subject">musicals</field><field name="subject">feminism and music</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Endangered by desire : T.G.H. Strehlow and the inexplicable vagaries of private passion</field><field name="creator">Hersey, Shane J.</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the depth of colonisation through translation. I develop an analytic framework that explores colonisation and translation using the trope of romantic love and an experimental textual construction incorporating translation and historical reconstruction. Utilising both the first and the final drafts of &#8220;Chapter X, Songs of Human Beauty and Love-charms&#8221; in Songs of Central Australia, by T. Strehlow, I show how that text, written over thirty years and comprised of nine drafts, can be described as a translation mediated by the colonising syntax and grammar. My interest lies in developing a novel textual technique to attempt to illustrate this problem so as to allow an insight into the perspective of a colonised person. This has involved a re-examination of translation as something other than a transtemporal structure predicated on direct equivalence, understanding it instead as something that fictionalises and reinvents the language that it purports to represent. It begins by establishing an understanding of the historical context in which the translated text is situated, from both objective and personal viewpoints, and then foregrounds the grammatical perspective of the argument. Utilising the techniques and processes of multiple translation, Internet-based translation software, creative writing and historical reconstruction, it continues to consider the role of imagination and begins the construction of a visceral argument whereby the reader is encouraged to experience a cognitive shift similar to that understood by the colonised other, which is revealed in a fictional autobiography written by an imagined other. It concludes by considering the coloniser within the same context, using, as an example T. Strehlow, who had a unique understanding of the Arrernte language. Tracking his extensive alterations, revisions and excisions within his drafts of Chapter X, this thesis traces a textual history of change, theorising that the translator, no matter how "authentic", is as much translated by the text as she or he is a translator of the text.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">translating and interpreting</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">postcolonialism</field><field name="subject">Arrente language</field><field name="subject">Aranda (Australian people)</field><field name="subject">Strehlow, T.

Nevertheless, reducing the proportion of pasture in these rotations has challenged the future productivity of farming systems in this area. First, the frequent application of selective herbicides for weed control in extended cropping rotations has promoted the development of herbicide resistance in a number of major agricultural weeds. Second, the primary use of annual plants has promoted the development of soil salinisation by allowing a significant proportion of rainfall to recharge saline water tables. The inclusion of perennial pasture phases between extended periods of cropping may mitigate or delay these constraints to production through (a) allowing the use of costeffective forms of non-selective weed control, and (b) through creating a buffer of dry soil that absorbs leakage occurring beneath subsequent crops. This study consequently explores the value of including perennial pasture phases in dryland agricultural systems in the eastern-central wheat belt of Western Australia, accounting for benefits related to herbicide resistance and water table management. A novel computational algorithm for the solution of multiple-phase optimal control problems is developed and used to conduct a conceptual analysis of the value of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) pasture for managing annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin), the primary weed in wheat belt cropping systems. The competitiveness and fecundity of annual ryegrass provide strong economic incentives to maintain a low weed population, irrespective of herbicide-resistance status. Consequently, the ineffectiveness of selective herbicides primarily reduces the profitability of cropping by motivating the adoption of more costly non-selective forms of weed control. The inclusion of lucerne in land-use rotations is only optimal in the presence of severe herbicide resistance given (a) the low efficiency of alternative weed-management practices available during the pasture phase, relative to selective-herbicide application; (b) the significant cost of establishing this perennial pasture; and (c) the high relative profitability of cereal production in the absence of resistance. The value of lucerne, relative to annual pastures, for weed management is explored in greater detail through the use of compressed annealing to optimise a sophisticated simulation model. The profitability of candidate rotations is also manipulated to account for the long-term production losses accruing to the recharge of saline groundwaters that occurs beneath them. Sequences incorporating lucerne are only more profitable than those that include annual pasture at the standard set of parameter values if (a) annual ryegrass is resistant to all selective herbicides, (b) the water table is so shallow (approximately less than 3.5 m deep) that frequent rotation with perennials is required to avert soil salinisation, or (c) sheep production is highly profitable. The value of perennial pasture is sufficient under these circumstances to overcome its high establishment cost. Consistent with intuition, these benefits are reinforced by lower discount rates and higher rates of leakage occurring beneath annual-based systems. Formulation of an effective communication strategy to report these results to producers is justified given the complexity involved in determining the true magnitude of these intertemporal benefits through alternative means, such as field trials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop rotation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant-soil relationships -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Pasture ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Pastures -- Management -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Pastures -- Weed control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Salinity control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Weeds -- Control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Perennial pastures</field><field name="subject">Crop rotations</field><field name="subject">Soil salinity</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transitive decompositions of graphs</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">A transitive decomposition of a graph is a partition of the arc set such that there exists a group of automorphisms of the graph which preserves and acts transitively on the partition. This turns out to be a very broad idea, with several striking connections with other areas of mathematics. In this thesis we first develop some general theory of transitive decompositions, and in particular we illustrate some of the more interesting connections with certain combinatorial and geometric structures. We then give complete, or nearly complete, structural characterisations of certain classes of transitive decompositions preserved by a group with a rank 3 action on vertices (such a group has exactly two orbits on ordered pairs of distinct vertices). The main classes of rank 3 groups we study (namely those which are imprimitive, or primitive of grid type) are derived in some way from 2-transitive groups (that is, groups which are transitive on ordered pairs of distinct vertices), and the results we achieve make use of the classification by Sibley in 2004 of transitive decompositions preserved by a 2-transitive group.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graph theory</field><field name="subject">Decomposition (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Permutation groups</field><field name="subject">Group theory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The feasibility of transferring cells from archived buccal swabs to FTA card for long term and simple storage of forensic samples</field><field name="creator">Khoory, Haifa</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The collection of buccal cells is common practise in the epidemiological and forensic science. Unlike venipuncture collection of blood; it is a safer, non-invasive method for collection of biological material. The methods by which these cells are collected from the inner cheek of an individual and stored are the key elements in preserving DNA. Typically, forensic samples require long term storage. Samples are commonly collected on cotton swabs and stored moist at low to ultra-low temperatures (less than -20oC). Although this is the method of choice in most forensic facilities, there are drawbacks. The samples are inherently contaminated with microflora within the oral cavity and the moisture allows a plethora of microorganisms to grow. As the time frame that has elapsed from collection to storage increases, there is an exponential increase in bacterial cells. Storage of containers containing swabs coated with cells at temperatures below 20oC is also costly due to requirements for large freezers which are running and monitored over 24 hours. In the pass 10 to 15 years, researchers have focussed on alternative ways to store buccal cells. The FTA card system by Whatman is one such development. The FTA card is unique in that it provides a means for the collection of buccal cells for storage at room temperature. DNA profiling from samples stored in this way for 11 years has been successfully achieved. The filter paper matrix of the FTA card binds and subsequently lyses cells.  ...  (2) The second component of this thesis describes a study which subjected cells on buccal swabs to various conditions of increased temperature over periods of time to establish if DNA could be amplified. The aim was to mimic exposure to the vigours of field conditions, particularly in the extreme local environments that prevail in the United Arab Emirates. a. Initially, buccal cells stored at -20oC over 360 days were used to mimic standard archiving procedures. The cells were subsequently transferred to FTA cards, amplified and profiled by using ABI AmpFLSTR Identifiler PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Complete STR profiles were successfully recovered from the archived swabs. In most cases 100% of alleles were recovered, suggesting that it is feasible to transfer DNA from properly archived buccal swabs to FTA cards. b. The second phase involved the storage of fresh swabs that had been artificially aged by using incubation temperatures ranging from 40oC to 100oC. Partial profiles resulted from artificially aged samples, indicating that the prevailing conditions prior to low temperature storage of the swabs plays an important role in ensuring cellular integrity and thus, DNA quality. Results from this study suggest that it is possible for biological samples stored under correct conditions to be transferred from swabs to FTA card. In combination, the two chapters presented in this study show that it is feasible to transfer achieved forensic biology samples from swabs to the FTA card system. However, it is necessary to ensure that the samples are treated in the correct manner so as to minimise contamination from external sources and to maintain the correct environmental state to maintain intact cells and usable DNA.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic sciences</field><field name="subject">Forensic genetics -- Technique</field><field name="subject">DNA fingerprints</field><field name="subject">Evidence, Criminal -- Preservation</field><field name="subject">Archived buccal swabs</field><field name="subject">FTA card simple storage</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">House and contents insurance: an exploration of tactility and narrative</field><field name="creator">Stachl, Erna</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationships between fictional narratives and material objects through writing and sculptural practice.

It is anticipated that the combination of material practice and textual fiction will not be an easy marriage: it may be the objects which ultimately give presence to our voices, voices which historically have often attempted to claim and own of things through utterance. The sculptural component of the project addresses the tactility of objects and examines the space where so many tales are told &#8211; the home. In so doing, the project explores issues of isolation and connection through objects and materials which harbour a narrative of ostensible comfort.

It begins with an analysis of Orientalism, as that text influences almost any discussion of representations of Easmest relations. Now, almost twenty years after Orientalism was first published in 1978 it is still a crucial text, and it still needs to be understood and argued with. The other texts looked at in this dissertation include novels, drama, films, opera, a musical, and the print and electronic mass media. They are texts that either represent or comment on EastIWest relations. The main texts I examine fall roughly into two categories: ones that are clearly orientalist and ones that are postorientalist. Those that are orientalist repeat the same myths of Orient Said describes in Orientalism. Those that are postorientalist challenge those myths by repeating and elaborating them, reversing and displacing the orientalist gaze.

The methodological approach is an eclectic blend of cultural studies and literary criticism. Such an approach enables analysis of a variety of texts, fiom classical nineteenth century books and myths through to contemporary postmodern representations, that deal with identity politics.

My thesis is that contemporary postcolonial representations that deal with East and West and that use and displace the very terms such categories rest upon, can be called "postoriental".</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture relations</field><field name="subject">English Literature</field><field name="subject">Postcolonial literature</field><field name="subject">Asian studies</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080122.112339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing a relational worldview: Watershed Torbay, Western Australia &#150; connecting community and place</field><field name="creator">louiseduxbury@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">The Australian landcare movement is considered to be a major success, with an extensive community landcare network developed, raised levels and depth of awareness, and a range of demonstration projects undertaken.  It has inspired people across Australia and has been emulated overseas.  However, negative trends in environmental conditions continue unabated. If the approach of the Australian landcare movement to date has not addressed the current unsustainable farming practices, what approach will?

This Australian study explores the history of the &#145;mechanistic&#146; worldview, its influence on the attitudes to and treatment of landscapes and indigenous knowledge from colonisation, and the ongoing impacts on current social and natural rural landscapes.  Increasing tension between the mechanistic worldview and the growing landcare ethic based on relationships is apparent.

Through the focus project, Watershed Torbay, a different way of seeing and treating the world is explored by praxis.  A worldview based on relationships and connection as the end purpose is proffered.  Strengthening connection with one&#146;s own moral framework, and relationships with people and place in community, are seen as the path to achieving sustainability based on ecological and values rationality.

It is recognised that there are multiple ways of seeing and experiencing the world, and it is important to give voice to all players with a connection to decision making.  This also means that there are different forms of knowledge; these can be grouped under the typology of epistemic or scientific knowledge, techne or technical/practical capability, and the central form of knowledge about values and interests.

I have worked with the focus project as a reflective practitioner undertaking action research; this is evident in the movement between theory and practice through the thesis.  The thesis concludes in praxis taking the learning from the focus project, and exploration of theory, to answer the question posed at the outset by outlining how the relational worldview can be applied to the regional bodies now delivering major landcare programs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relational worldview</field><field name="subject">landcare</field><field name="subject">regional natural resource management</field><field name="subject">landcare history</field><field name="subject">worldviews</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">connectio</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080617.132132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of infection with leptospira species in livestock in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">nvetlab@online.net.pg</field><field name="description">The role of infection with Leptospira as a cause of infertility in Papua New Guinea(PNG) has not been confirmed, mainly because of the lack of robust and simple diagnostic tests in PNG. The aims of this study were to determine the seroprevalence and distribution of infection in livestock in PNG and to develop and validate a diagnostic test for use in PNG that was sufficiently accurate and reliable for confident interpretation of the results. The nested and real-time PCRs were assessed for use as diagnostic tools.

The first survey was conducted on 3 commercial, 3 smallholder cattle farms and 4 abattoirs in March 2004 in PNG. Each herd was stratified into 3 age groups (&lt; 2, 2-5 and &gt;5 years), and sera from 1379 animals were sampled in Lae and Kimbe. In addition, 73 kidneys were collected from cattle at the abattoir and aseptically processed for culture. Two hundred and eighty three sera were collected from pigs killed at the abattoirs and 79 pig kidneys were collected and cultured. All sera were tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). The dominant serovar infecting the cattle in PNG was Hardjo with a seroprevalence of 53.7%. The prevalence of serovar Hardjo in the six farms and the abattoir was significantly higher than serovars Tarassovi and Pomona (P &lt; 0.05). All pig sera were negative for Leptospira. Leptospires were isolated by culture and the isolates were typed and identified as L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo. Cattle are a recognized reservoir for serovar Hardjo and may have a role in transmission to humans.

The second survey was conducted in June 2006 to determine if cattle from smallholder farmers, village pigs and dogs in the Markham Valley in Lae, PNG were infected with Leptospira. In addition, pigs from a commercial piggery and horses from commercial and smallholder farms were also sampled. A total of 69 pig sera, 22 dog sera, 15 horse sera and 111 cattle sera were collected. The results showed that 1 dog and 1 pig were seropositive with serovar Canicola. Of the 111 cattle sampled, 21 were seropositive for Hardjo. It was concluded that the seroprevalence with serovar Hardjo in these cattle was significantly lower than cattle from commercial properties. Smallholder cattle may therefore not be a major source of Hardjo infection for animals on commercial farms and pigs do not appear to be infected with Leptospira.

The Ab-ELISAs were constructed using one crude preparations of L. interrogans serovar Pomona and 2 different crude preparation of L. biflexa serovar Patoc. The three antigen preparations were evaluated using 21 MAT-positive and 96 MAT-negative pig sera to determine which antigen preparation was suitable for use in an Ab&#150;ELISA. The selected antigen preparation (L1) was validated in the test using serum from 2 cattle and 1 pig population that were seropositive for Leptospira. A sub-population of seronegative cattle and pigs were also used. The Ab-ELISA was used to test 1,465 bovine sera from 8 cattle populations and the results were compared with the MAT using a Bayesian framework, to obtain an unbiased estimate of the accuracy of the tests. The ELISA had high sensitivity and specificity. Results from the Bayesian analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity estimates for the Ab-ELISA were high compared to the MAT. Based on the test accuracy and its performance the Ab-ELISA using the L1 antigen described in this study is suitable for use in countries like PNG where the MAT is difficult to perform.

Samples of kidneys from livestock in PNG were tested using culture and a PCR-based assay to detect Leptospira species. A total of 72 samples of kidney were collected from cattle and a total of 74 samples were collected from pigs slaughtered in Lae and Port Moresby. A second study was designed to assess the use of a real-time PCR for detecting leptospiral DNA in urine from cattle. One hundred and ninety-three urine samples were collected from a beef cattle farm in WA. Whole genomic DNA from kidney samples was extracted from each kidney using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Heat lysis was used to extract genomic DNA from clear urine samples and the QIAamp Mini Kit was used for urine that was contaminated with faeces. The PCR-based test was able to detect a higher number of Leptospira-positive kidneys compared to culture in EMJH medium. Results of testing DNA extracted from urine using the realtime PCR showed that this test is sensitive and able to detect cattle infected with pathogenic leptospires.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leptospira</field><field name="subject">livestock</field><field name="subject">papua new guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080617.141905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vocalisations with a better view : hyperarticulation augments the auditory-visual advantage for the detection of speech in noise</field><field name="creator">Lees, Nicole C.</field><field name="description">Recent studies have shown that there is a visual influence early in speech processing - visual speech enhances the ability to detect auditory speech in noise. However, identifying exactly how visual speech interacts with auditory processing at such an early stage has been challenging, because this so-called AV speech detection advantage is both highly related to a specific lower-order, signal-based, optic-acoustic relationship between the second formant amplitude and the area of the mouth (F2/Mouth-area), and mediated by higher-order, information-based factors. Previous investigations either have maximised or minimised information-based factors, or have minimised signal-based factors, in order to try to tease out the relative importance of these sources of the advantage, but they have not yet been successful in this endeavour. Maximising signal-based factors has not previously been explored. This avenue was explored in this thesis by manipulating speaking style,  hyperarticulated speech was used to maximise signal-based factors, and hypoarticulated speech to minimise signal-based factors - to examine whether the AV speech detection advantage is modified by these means, and to provide a clearer idea of the primary source of visual influence in the AV detection advantage. Two sets of six studies were conducted. In the first set, three recorded speech styles, hyperarticulated, normal, and hypoarticulated, were extensively analysed in physical (optic and acoustic) and perceptual (visual and auditory) dimensions ahead of stimulus selection for the second set of studies. The analyses indicated that the three styles comprise distinctive categories on the Hyper-Hypo continuum of articulatory effort (Lindblom, 1990). Most relevantly, both optically and visually hyperarticulated speech was more informative, and hypoarticulated less informative, than normal speech with regard to signal-based movement factors. However, the F2/Mouth-area correlation was similarly strong for all speaking styles, thus allowing examination of signal-based, visual informativeness on AV speech detection with optic-acoustic association controlled. In the second set of studies, six Detection Experiments incorporating the three speaking styles were designed to examine whether, and if so why, more visually-informative (hyperarticulated) speech augmented, and less visually informative (hypoarticulated) speech attenuated, the AV detection advantage relative to normal speech, and to examine visual influence when auditory speech was absent. Detection Experiment 1 used a two-interval, two-alternative (first or second interval, 2I2AFC) detection task, and indicated that hyperarticulation provided an AV detection advantage greater than for normal and hypoarticulated speech, with less of an advantage for hypoarticulated than for normal speech. Detection Experiment 2 used a single-interval, yes-no detection task to assess responses in signal-absent independent of signal-present conditions as a means of addressing participants&#8217; reports that speech was heard when it was not presented in the 2I2AFC task. Hyperarticulation resulted in an AV detection advantage, and for all speaking styles there was a consistent response bias to indicate speech was present in signal-absent conditions. To examine whether the AV detection advantage for hyperarticulation was due to visual, auditory or auditory-visual factors, Detection Experiments 3 and 4 used mismatching AV speaking style combinations (AnormVhyper, AnormVhypo, AhyperVnorm, AhypoVnorm) that were onset-matched or time-aligned, respectively. The results indicated that higher rates of mouth movement can be sufficient for the detection advantage with weak optic-acoustic associations, but, in circumstances where these associations are low, even high rates of movement have little impact on augmenting detection in noise. Furthermore, in Detection Experiment 5, in which visual stimuli consisted only of the mouth movements extracted from the three styles, there was no AV detection advantage, and it seems that this is so because extra-oral information is required, perhaps to provide a frame of reference that improves the availability of mouth movement to the perceiver. Detection Experiment 6 used a new 2I-4AFC task and the measures of false detections and response bias to identify whether visual influence in signal absent conditions is due to response bias or an illusion of hearing speech in noise (termed here the Speech in Noise, SiN, Illusion). In the event, the SiN illusion occurred for both the hyperarticulated and the normal styles &#8211; styles with reasonable amounts of movement change. For normal speech, the responses in signal-absent conditions were due only to the illusion of hearing speech in noise, whereas for hypoarticulated speech such responses were due only to response bias. For hyperarticulated speech there is evidence for the presence of both types of visual influence in signal-absent conditions. It seems to be the case that there is more doubt with regard to the presence of auditory speech for non-normal speech styles. An explanation of past and present results is offered within a new framework -the Dynamic Bimodal Accumulation Theory (DBAT). This is developed in this thesis to address the limitations of, and conflicts between, previous theoretical positions. DBAT suggests a bottom-up influence of visual speech on the processing of auditory speech; specifically, it is proposed that the rate of change of visual movements guides auditory attention rhythms &#8216;on-line&#8217; at corresponding rates, which allows selected samples of the auditory stream to be given prominence. Any patterns contained within these samples then emerge from the course of auditory integration processes. By this account, there are three important elements of visual speech necessary for enhanced detection of speech in noise. First and foremost, when speech is present, visual movement information must be available (as opposed to hypoarticulated and synthetic speech) Then the rate of change, and opticacoustic relatedness also have an impact (as in Detection Experiments 3 and 4). When speech is absent, visual information has an influence; and the SiN illusion (Detection Experiment 6) can be explained as a perceptual modulation of a noise stimulus by visually-driven rhythmic attention. In sum, hyperarticulation augments the AV speech detection advantage, and, whenever speech is perceived in noisy conditions, there is either response bias to perceive speech or a SiN illusion, or both. DBAT provides a detailed description of these results, with wider-ranging explanatory power than previous theoretical accounts. Predictions are put forward for examination of the predictive power of DBAT in future studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech perception</field><field name="subject">auditory perception</field><field name="subject">lipreading</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">noise</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated negotiation in multi-agent based e-business</field><field name="creator">Huq, Golenur B.</field><field name="description">Negotiation is one of the most important activities for organisations in conducting electronic business. Traditional purchasing and selling have been conducted through complex processes involving negotiation that includes coordination and cooperation. To conduct automated negotiation for electronic business, a multi-agent system is needed where agents interact with each other. To perform this activity effectively and efficiently agents need to be able to negotiate, coordinate and cooperate with each other within the system. The research detailed in this thesis investigated the negotiation process in business-to business (B2B) transactions in supply chain management for multi-agent based electronic business (e business). Specifically, it answers the following research question: How can the negotiation process in B2B transactions be formulated and applied in multi-agent based e-business? The research strategy utilized an exploratory case study framework, with methods from decision theory, game theory, fuzzy logic and simulation for analysis. A series of integrated studies were undertaken to develop: an automated negotiation protocol; negotiation strategies; and a coordination and cooperation model. These were analysed in the context of the case study, Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM) game scenario. Currently, the TAC SCM is the only international competition involving an electronic marketplace (e market). The studies involved the negotiation strategy between two agents, where the agents will be able to solve a problem by finding the best feasible strategy to bind an agreement for negotiation. By adopting a maximin and minimax strategy, this research proposes that agents will reach a reasonable positive intention approach towards negotiation, and will increase the agreement binding rate. A negotiation strategy was also examined by Fuzzy Logic using possibility theory and linguistic variables in which it also proposes a negotiation strategy in an uncertain situation for the TAC SCM. This will aid in binding the agreement to achieve the agent&#8217;s expected profit. Next, this research reviewed the TAC SCM game and explored the procurement performance of agents.The monotonic concession negotiation protocol, which determines the rules in which the agents can offer and counter-offer in the negotiation process was investigated. The author proposes two types of protocols. The first protocol is a Non-Monotonic Protocol with theoretical analysis. The second protocol is an Extended and Flexible Iterated Negotiation Process. This research also developed an Extended Bilateral Negotiation Model based on OMG (1999). The Negotiation Mechanism involving Offering and Counter-Offering models were also developed. Next, this research reviewed the cooperation and coordination process. This study identified problems in conducting e-business and supply chain management and expected benefits for supply chains with agents working together in coordinated and cooperative processes. The utilization of the multi-agent system in supply chain management with the Enhanced and Effective Cooperative Processing Stages is discussed. To apply these stages, the author proposes an architecture of Effective Cooperative Processing for Agents, and some characteristics in modelling coordination and cooperation for TAC SCM have been outlined. The research detailed how the negotiation process in B2B transactions can be formulated and applied in multi-agent based e-business. Through the proposal of a Flexible and Iterated Negotiation Framework, consisting of an Extended Bilateral Negotiation Model and a Cooperation and Coordination Model, the research community moves further towards the ultimate goal of an efficient, economic and automated negotiation process. In summary, the main contributions of the thesis include: a theoretical analysis of the negotiation process with coordination and cooperation; proposed models for an automated negotiation process; development of strategies and protocols for automated negotiation; and the coordination and cooperation model that can be used not only in supply chain management but also in any type of e-business.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">negotiation</field><field name="subject">intelligent agents (computer software)</field><field name="subject">business logistics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hollywood and its others : porous borders and creative tensions in the transnational screenscape</field><field name="creator">Mills, Jane Kathryn</field><field name="description">This dissertation challenges how Hollywood is typically imagined as monolithic, homogenous and homogenising, and separated from other cinemas by fixed and impermeable borders. This influential cinematic paradigm posits a centre-periphery model underpinned by binary oppositions in which most cinemas are negatively defined as Hollywood&#8217;s &#8216;other&#8217; and perceived as fixed in permanent states of opposition and assimilation. It is a perception reinforced by the influential critical paradigm which focuses on the films&#8217; formal stylistic and narrative properties. This conceptualisation ignores, or fails to observe, the larger picture, in which global, national and local cinemas relate to each other in complex and volatile ways. My argument is that a paradigm shift is required in which the main question asked is not &#8216;What is Hollywood?&#8217; but &#8216;Where is Hollywood?&#8217; Location is a crux of my argument because it offers a way of questioning the widespread conception of Hollywood as bounded and fixed in a stable cultural landscape. I apply Arjun Appadurai&#8217;s framework of disjunctive global cultural flows to the analysis of cinema to show the existence of a more dynamic and chaotic screenscape than is popularly imagined. I also develop a new model of textual analysis involving traces and tracings. This troubles the notion of impermeable borders by finding the traces of global cultural flows within the film frame and tracing their trajectories outside the frame to and from their points of origin and destination. From the creative tensions caused by these asymmetrical and, multidirectional flows a previously unobserved screenscape emerges in which it is possible to see globalising processes as hybridising processes. Within this interpretive framework Hollywood is decentred and can no longer be perceived as fixed and bounded, or as the paradigm by which most cinemas define themselves and are judged. It reveals that heterogeneity and flux rather than homogeneity and fixity characterise intercinematic relations. It shows the existence of porous borders permitting transnational flows. In linking a film&#8217;s formal stylistic properties to the disjunctions in the global flows, the new model I develop for textual analysis offers a way of re-imagining Hollywood within the transnational imaginary.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">motion picture industry</field><field name="subject">Hollywood (Los Angeles, Calif.)</field><field name="subject">industries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The socio-economic and psychological determinants of student academic outcomes in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Genevieve F.</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea (PNG), a country characterised by tremendous linguistic, environmental, and cultural diversity, has experienced a history of educational reform and political and social turbulence. Attempts to inform educational interventions and successful policy change in PNG have been erratic. In addition, there is a paucity of sound methodological research which has impeded effective change. As such, little is known about the key determinants of academic outcomes for PNG students. The purpose of the current study was to test a comprehensive cross-cultural model of the relation of a suite of psycho-social constructs to academic outcomes for PNG students from urban, rural, and village educational settings. This model examined the influence of socio-economic status, parent education, future goal orientation, perceived instrumental value, motivation, self-concept, and self-regulation upon PNG students&#8217; academic outcomes. In order to test this model in PNG, three main studies were conducted. The first study (n=917) aimed to examine the psychometric properties of relevant instrumentation, and the differences in students&#8217; endorsement of future goals, perceived instrumentality, motivation, self-concept, and self-regulation, across different groups in PNG. This study found the instrumentation to be valid and reliable for use in PNG, as well as structurally invariant across gender, grade, and region groups. Gender, grade, and region profile differences were also found for each of the five psychological variables. The second study (n=917) aimed to examine the relations between key socio-economic and psychological factors, and the impact that these variables had upon achievement and effort outcomes. The results firstly highlighted students&#8217; socio-economic status and parent education as being positive predictors of student outcomes. Next, village-oriented future goals and perceived instrumentality, mastery and social motivation, and domain specific academic self-concept, were all found to be significant, positive predictors of students&#8217; achievement and effort scores. Furthermore, authority future goals and perceived instrumentality and performance motivation were found to be negative predictors of student outcomes. Finally, the third study (n=52) aimed to illuminate and extend the results of the quantitative studies with qualitative data from students, teachers, and parents. This study found that these groups emphasised the importance of future goals, perceived instrumentality, motivation, and self-regulation as predictors of students&#8217; educational experiences, and they highlighted the underlying relations between these variables and student outcomes. Results also highlighted a number of additional psychological, linguistic, and socio-cultural factors, as serving important roles in students&#8217; educational experiences. Findings of the current investigation were interpreted within the cross-cultural framework of the student model that was utilised. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the key determinants of student achievement and effort within PNG, but also for future cross-cultural research examining related determinants within other Indigenous, developing, and Indigenous majority countries. Furthermore, the findings have implications for future research, practice, and policy interventions within PNG, and provide guidance for the development of culturally sensitive and appropriate interventions to aid the achievement and effort of students living in PNG.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education, higher</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying the reproductive state of female Julia Creek dunnarts (Sminthopsis douglasi) by behavioural observations</field><field name="creator">Bjursell, Alice</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The Julia Creek dunnart (Sminthopsis douglasi) is an endangered carnivorous marsupial. A recovery plan for the species has been initiated by Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which includes captive breeding.An important factor in breeding S. douglasi is the identification of oestrus. The current method to identify oestrus consists of examining urine samplesfor presence of cornified cells. To collect urine, the animals have to be removed from their cages and restrained. This method is stressful for theanimals, as well as time consuming. The aim of this study was to identify specific behaviour of S. douglasi associated with oestrus, which could be readily observed without the need for handling the animal. This wouldprovide a non-invasive way of identifying oestrus, which would facilitate breeding the species in captivity and planning conservation programs.Behaviour of S. douglasi was observed throughout the night by video recording. The most striking result was the increase in activity of the female when she was in oestrus compared to non-oestrus. The most informativebehaviour to observe was entry by the female into the nest box and the frequency with which she entered the area closest to the wall of the enclosure. A discriminant function analysis generated an equation with anover-all predictive power (OPP, the probability of making an accurate identification of reproductive state) of 89%. This result was obtained by watching two random five-minute periods of activity. The equation was tested and verified with new individuals and attained a similar level of OPP. However, the equation was less accurate when the observed female&#8217;s social context was changed from being housed adjacent to a male, to being accompanied by another female or housed singularly. Consistent with thesensitivity of activity levels as an indicator, the distance run in an exercise wheel was also a good predictor of oestrous state. Females ran a significantly longer distance in their exercise wheel when in oestruscompared to non-oestrus (p&lt;0.001).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Julia</field><field name="subject">Creek</field><field name="subject">dunnart;</field><field name="subject">dunnarts;</field><field name="subject">reproduction;</field><field name="subject">reproductive</field><field name="subject">state</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004243/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variability in the accumulation of amino acids and glycinebetaine in wheat and barley under environmental stress</field><field name="creator">Naidu, Bodaparti Purushothama.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 187-216.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Wheat Physiology</field><field name="subject">Barley Physiology</field><field name="subject">Wheat Drought resistance</field><field name="subject">Barley Drought resistance</field><field name="subject">Plants, Effect of stress on</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phn155.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:5921818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pollination of almond (Prunus dulcis (Mill.)

Much has been written about how larger firms internationalise through the gradual acquisition of knowledge and resources, although there is a paucity of literature on how the MCE exploits international markets often despite the absence of such acquisitions. This thesis proposes that building a portfolio of relationships is critical in facilitating both market entry and subsequent outcomes. A more detailed investigation of this process helps reveal precisely how MCE internationalisation is largely a function of its specific relationship building efforts.Employing a multiple case study approach, in-depth interviews were held with founders and directors from seven MCE's, purposely selected from three main centres of commercial activity in New Zealand. Interview participants were encouraged to provide detailed longitudinal retrospections of their firm's internationalisation journey, with a particular emphasis on precisely how resource constraints were overcome during this process. All interviews were recorded and transcribed, and together with other confirmatory data sources, these formed the canon of evidence used for ongoing analysis and interpretation. The whole research process was an iterative one with observations made from earlier cases being challenged and refined through the consideration of data from subsequent cases.Several key findings emerged from this study. Firstly, internationalisation is of considerable significance to the MCE in that it expands product and market opportunities, improves operational competencies, and provides an outlet for the achievement of both financial and relational goals. Secondly, key relationships developed during this process include internal, manufacturer/supplier, distributor, support, EPO, and end-user types. Thirdly, MCE's gravitate towards adopting either a social exchange (characterised by trust, commitment and social norms) or transaction cost analysis (characterised by contractual mechanisms) approach to developing these relationship types. Critical to this finding though and previously unobserved in the literature, is that within the context of a social exchange or transaction cost analysis approach, governance (bilateral or unilateral/market) may be observed as a separate construct. Finally, the MCE adopting a social exchange approach overall achieves more robust international outcomes particularly in respect to increased cost efficiencies and new market opportunities.Although no statistical inferences can be drawn from the findings of this study, some important generalisations to theory can be made in respect to the manner in which small firm internationalisation is currently modelled. It is suggested that this research has begun to address the issue by proposing that the quality of relationships is central to the success of the smallest of internationalising concerns. Specifically, sequential knowledge, network, and resource based views, need to better incorporate the moderating role that the relational paradigm has on international progress. To this end it has been demonstrated that the precise underpinnings of the relationship can have a determining effect on both the rate and cost of international progress. Furthermore, managers may also benefit from these findings by improving both their relationship filtering and nurturing processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Micro-enterprise</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">social-exchange</field><field name="subject">TCA</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The secondary school teacher in New Zealand, 1945-2000 : teacher identity and education reform : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in History at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Couling, Donald F</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to show how the secondary teacher in New Zealand was constituted in discourse through an examination of two major recontextualisations of education, the changes resulting from the Thomas Report (1944),  and the Picot Report (1988),  and of the collective identity of secondary teachers. Both reports redirected government education policy and regulation and had fundamental implications for teachers' work and the role they were expected to play in education.  Secondary teachers resisted both reforms, and in doing so they revealed elements of their conservative, pragmatic and defensive collective identity, which changed in only one significant respect in the time period considered in this study. It took twenty years before the central tenets of the Thomas Report were even close to being universally accepted. Even then, the child-centred philosophy and practice propounded by the Thomas Report, supported by the Currie Report in 1962  and supervised by the gentle discipline of the Department of Education, was likely to have been more honoured in the breach than in the observance by many New Zealand secondary school teachers.  In more recent times, the 'neo-liberal', market-driven view of education and teachers, as expressed in the reforms which followed the Picot Report, were stoutly resisted despite the much more rigorous disciplinary techniques employed by the Ministry of Education. This thesis will show that the dominant discourses which constituted the secondary teacher were those of the collective identity of secondary teachers and that these effectively frustrated attempts to impose change on New Zealand secondary teachers and on secondary education.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Bernstein</field><field name="subject">Collective identity</field><field name="subject">Secondary teachers</field><field name="subject">Thomas Report</field><field name="subject">Tomorrow's Schools</field><field name="subject">330102 History and philosophy of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership in Aotearoa New Zealand : M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; perceptions of outstanding leadership : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Management at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pfeifer, Dale Marie</field><field name="description">Exploring the leadership of New Zealand&#8217;s diverse cultural groups is of great importance in providing effective leadership. New Zealand&#8217;s population is diverse and rapidly changing (Statistics New Zealand, 2004b), resulting in leader-follower relationships increasingly being enacted in the cross-cultural context. As research suggests, cultural variations of leadership exist (Brodbeck et al., 2000; House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, &amp; Gupta, 2004), and inappropriate leadership could stifle the leadership process (Lord &amp; Maher, 1993), it may be especially important to recognise cultural difference in leadership. Well-respected leadership theorists suggest that leadership behaviour is both culturally similar and different (Brodbeck et al., 2000; House et al., 2004), with distinct prototypes of leadership existing in each culture. Followers will only be influenced by leaders&#8217; behaviour which they recognise from that prototype (Lord &amp; Maher, 1993). To be effective, leaders&#8217; behaviour must match followers&#8217; culturally contingent leadership expectation (Popper &amp; Druyan, 2001). New Zealand research supports this theory, confirming the existence of culturally unique leadership behaviour domestically (Ah Chong &amp; Thomas, 1997; Love, 1991a). If the leadership expectations of New Zealand&#8217;s diverse cultural groups are not recognised, the result will be ineffective leadership for significant groups. This study investigates perceptions of outstanding Maori and Pakeha leaders by culturally similar followers. In doing so, it examines the unique Maori and Pakeha leadership prototypes, exploring their similarities and differences. In addition, it considers ways in which this course of research could impact on effective leadership in New Zealand. A multi-method approach was taken by this study in exploring perceived Maori and Pakeha leadership. The GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness) survey was employed as this study&#8217;s quantitative component. The GLOBE is currently cross-cultural leadership&#8217;s fore-running research programme, investigating culture&#8217;s impact on leadership processes in 62 cultures, with the aim of developing a truly cross-cultural leadership theory. Close iwi consultation with Te Atiawa and Maori academics was employed as this study&#8217;s qualitative component. This study&#8217;s findings suggest similarities and differences in how Maori and Pakeha followers perceived the outstanding leadership behaviour of culturally similar leaders. Broadly, they suggest that outstanding Maori leaders were perceived as exhibiting a greater degree of humane-orientated and self-protective behaviour. In some instances, outstanding Maori leaders were also perceived as exhibiting a greater degree of charismatic/value-based and team-orientated behaviour, although in some cases this was perceived as similar for outstanding Maori and Pakeha leaders.

The philosophical approaches underpinning the study were derived from the field of critical gerontology, postmodernism and the utilisation of a Foucauldian understanding of discourse and power/knowledge. Data sources included published documents on delirium, interviews with people over the age of 65 years who had been delirious (as well as their clinical notes), family members, registered nurses and a doctor.Textual analysis revealed the presence of two contesting and contradictory discourses that impacted on being an older person who had delirium. These were identified as the discourse of delirium as a syndrome and a personal discourse of delirium. The discourse of delirium as a syndrome is underpinned by the biomedicalisation of the ageing process. This process utilises scientific methods as the foundation from which to understand, research and provide a health service to older people with delirium. Any personal perspectives on delirium are rendered unimportant and relegated to marginalised positions. Nursing through its vicarious relationship to medicine is interpellated into deploying the discourse of delirium as a syndrome and has largely ignored the personal dimensions associated with this phenomenon. Consequently, the older delirious 'body' is known and inscribed as unruly, problematic, physically unwell, cognitively impaired and at risk.Conversely, a personal discourse of delirium privileges the individual narratives of people who have been delirious and provides a different perspective of delirium. The deployment of a personal discourse of delirium offers another position that views this group of older people as bringing to the health care setting a rich tapestry of life experiences that are more than a cluster of signs and symptoms. It is these varied life experiences that need to be included as a legitimate source of knowledge about delirium. This thesis demonstrates how nursing needs to espouse a critical gerontological position when working with older people who have delirium. Critical gerontology provides nurses with the theoretical tools to challenge the status quo and uncover the multiple, varied, contradictory and complex representations of delirium in older people.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">delirium</field><field name="subject">gerontological nursing</field><field name="subject">social gerontology</field><field name="subject">confusion</field><field name="subject">critical gerontology</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the stability of the sense of coherence for those attending a three-week rehabilitation programme : a thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Rehabilitation at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hocquard, Toni Jacqueline</field><field name="description">Those with chronic illnesses or disabilities face numerous obstacles and issues as they come to terms with and manage the realities of their situation. How well health care providers and funders understand this can determine the types and quality of services offered. Antonovsky (1993) has developed the Sense of Coherence (SOC) concept, which introduces a salutogenic (health promotion) model of health. This challenges the pathogenic model (origins of disease) that dominates health care. A relationship between the SOC and coping has been established in the literature. Currently, the SOC is widely viewed as a stable personality trait, but emerging evidence suggests that the SOC may be amenable to change. The purpose of the study was essentially to investigate the stability of the SOC in relation to an intervention over time. The study was conducted using a time series design (Pre-admission (T1), admission(T2), discharge (T3), 6-month follow up(T4)). A convenience sample of 120 participants (93 women, 27 men) was recruited for the study. The instruments used as dependant measures were the SOC-29, the Acceptance of Disability Scale ADM (modified) and the SF-36. Analysis of the SOC-29 revealed a significant change over time (p= .05), with the follow up analysis indicating that this change occurred following the intervention. This same finding was also true of the ADM scores (p=0.0005). This was not sustained at 6-month follow up for either the SOC or the ADM. Analyses of the SF-36 scores showed a significant improvement from admission to the 6-month follow up on all scores except general health. Only 72 participants completed at the 6-month follow up and this reduced the power of the study to yield a statistically significant result. Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis revealed that over 93% of the participants had medium to high SOC scores at the beginning of the study and this may have impacted on the outcome. There were significant correlations between the scores on the SOC-29 and the ADM and all scales of the SF-36 except physical function. As the significant change in SOC-29 scores was not sustained at the six-month follow up it could suggest that the SOC is indeed a stable trait. However, there were other factors identified, related to the characteristics of the sample and to wider factors that could have had an impact on the outcome of this study. In particular it is possible that a 3-week programme is not long enough to effect a lasting change in the SOC and this raises questions about health care delivery for those who have chronic illness or disability.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sense of coherence</field><field name="subject">adjustment</field><field name="subject">psychosocial</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">funding</field><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and therapy: occupational and physical</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When prudence is reckless : rethinking the role of project risk management : a 152.785 (25 point) research report presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Busch, Adrian</field><field name="description">Despite the widespread use of project risk management, the results of such efforts are often underwhelming.

The approach prescribed in the Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge is compared to the very different approach of a professional project manager. A theorised analysis of the difference between these approaches finds that they employ the logic of different knowledge-constitutive interests thereby making them suitable for different purposes.

It argues that government policy influences women's lives, not just materially through legislation, but ideologically through the promotion of certain discourses, which enable and constrain women's choices. In order to explore the interface between policy and experience, critical discourse analysis was used to examine two texts: the Action Plan for New Zealand Women (Ministry of Women's Affairs, 2004a), a government policy document, and the talk of two groups of first time mothers. This methodology focuses on the power of language to constitute reality and examines which institutions and ideologies are supported by discursive constructions.Although freedom to choose a life path is part of the policy's vision for New Zealand women, paid work is consistently privileged over caring roles. Motherhood is all but invisible and is constructed as an inevitable and undesirable demand, while paid work is constructed as essential to individual well-being and a duty of citizenship. An economic rationalist discourse positions women as workers first and foremost with a responsibility to financially provide for themselves and their children. Despite drawing on feminist discourses to warrant its vision, the policy is driven by capitalist goals of increased productivity and economic growth rather than the needs of women.The women deployed an intensive mother discourse which privileged their maternal role and positioned babies as needing parental care, and mothers as the natural providers of that care. However, they also felt the pressure of the successful woman and economic rationalist discourses in which paid work is essential and motherhood is devalued. The tension between these discourses manifested as guilt and conflict, managed in part through the emergence of newer constructions of independent mother and child. In making their decision about re-entering the paid workforce, in most instances the traditional paternal role as primary breadwinner was unchallenged, while the maternal role was expanded to incorporate not just primary caregiver, but also worker. The thesis finishes by considering the social consequences of these discursive constructions and argues that current discourses do not serve women, children, or men well. What is needed is a more complete breakdown of the public/private divide: a society which values care and work, both as responsibilities and rewards of citizenship, and which will therefore allow both women and men to construct more balanced lives and identities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motherhood</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What it means to be online for people with disabilities : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bowker, Natilene Irain</field><field name="description">People with disabilities have traditionally occupied stigmatised identities due to less conventional ways of operating in daily life. The online medium with its absence of visible identity markers, which have typically determined how a person is read offline, combined with the constructive potential embedded within a largely textual medium, potentially, bring together greater control and flexibility in identity construction. The online medium, therefore, may offer social benefits to people with disabilities that are not available in other contexts. This research discursively explores what kinds of experiences are available for people with disabilities online. It argues that the online medium offers alternative subjectivities for positioning people with disabilities in the social world. Discursive findings, however, also show that operating online within a disabled identity creates marginalised experiences.Discourse analysis, underpinned by a social constructionist philosophy, which emphasises the constructive nature of language in creating experience, is utilised as a methodology for gathering and analysing data. I have adopted Gilbert and Mulkay's (1984) concept of an 'interpretative repertoire' to manage the construction of discursive patterns identified in the data. Semi-structured interviews with 21 people with physical and sensory disabilities, who used the online medium daily, or several times per week, were carried out. Participants were recruited from various disability organisations in New Zealand and were invited to take part in an online interview via email, or another online communication program of their choice. Participants were met in person prior to the interviews to confirm the researcher's credibility and to build rapport.Seven key repertoires were identified in the data, with each one organised around several discursive resources. A choice to disclose repertoire allows disability to become a flexible feature of identity to be revealed and/or concealed in a contextualised and occasioned fashion. The accessing a socially valued subjectivity repertoire enables people with disabilities to position themselves as valued members of the social world, free of the physical and psychological barriers constructed by others that surround disabled identities. A transcendence repertoire functions in the talk of people with disabilities by surpassing the physical, social, and psychological limitations arising from having to operate within a disabled body, allowing far greater capacity for participation. A participating in the world repertoire affords people with disabilities the opportunity to be part of a wider community of relationships, people, interests, activities, and information, creating a sense of global belonging and connection. The keeping safe and qualified deception repertoires, together, enable people with disabilities to successfully manage the dilemma of participating in a medium where there is potential for substantial self-gain as well as harm. In contrast to the repertoires available for experiencing alternative subjectivities, which operate outside the oppression of disabled identities, a disabling differentials repertoire demonstrates the social disadvantages surrounding disabled identities online. Discursive findings are discussed in relation to disembodiment, as the online medium enables abilities to extend beyond the body, lifting the ceiling on standard ways of operating. This opens up psychological benefits as people with disabilities are afforded opportunities to access and participate within many dimensions of social life. At a collective level, political implications associated with the absence online of disabled identities are raised. Issues of technopower are also mentioned, along with future research directions. Overall, participants' constructions demonstrate how the online medium makes available a social space where people with disabilities can temporarily step outside the physical, social, and psychological constraints of operating within disabled subjectivities. This was cherished and celebrated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">online experience</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">social psychology</field><field name="subject">cyberpsychology</field><field name="subject">380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A qualitative exploration of emotional competence and its relevance to nursing relationships : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Stacey Caroline</field><field name="description">This qualitative research project explored the experiences of nurse educators who sought to assess aspects, which could be related to facilitation of emotional competence, in nursing students.  Focus groups were conducted in three different educational institutions, offering a Bachelor of nursing degree.  Each of the participants had a teaching and assessment role within the school of nursing.  The contributions of the nurse educators and their interactions were audio taped, transcribed and then later, analysed using thematic and focus group analysis practices.From the analysis of the experiences of the nurse educators, four predominant themes arose which capture the areas of importance to the participants.  Student nurses can develop emotional competence by critically reflecting during classroom and clinical experiences.  Continuous consideration must be made within each practicing area of nursing, of the environmental and relational challenges which inhibit or facilitate nurse's ability to practice with emotional competence.  Educators and practicing nurses, who work alongside students, must uphold the expectation that emotional competence is a requisite ability and provide opportunities to foster emotional growth and skills to resolve conflict within the culture of nursing.A common view shared by the educators was that the profession of nursing needs to have a clear understanding of what constitutes emotional competence.  Strategies to realistically incorporate emotional competence into the educational curriculum and competency based assessment opportunities within nursing education are required.Suggestions are presented from which undergraduate nursing education can facilitate development of emotional competence with those students working toward becoming a registered nurse.  Emotional competence is suggested as an essential learning outcome in the movement toward transformative nursing education and a collaborative nursing profession.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotion</field><field name="subject">undergraduate education</field><field name="subject">emotional competence</field><field name="subject">critical thinking</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the effects of aging on memory in healthy young, middle-aged, and oldest-old adults : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Pyschology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lamont, Allison</field><field name="description">While a growing body of research indicates that older adults typically perform more poorly on many types of memory tasks than do younger adults, relatively little research has addressed the question of whether this trend continues unchanged into the late ninth and tenth decades of life. Such decrements in memory have been reported as linear declines from early adulthood up until about 80 years of age. Questions arise as to whether such memory declines slow or accelerate in very advanced aging, and to what extent differences are due to aging, per se, or variables that intervene between age and memory.To address these two questions, six memory types - verbal recall, nonverbal recall, short-term memory, working memory, face recognition, and prospective memory - were examined using both cross-sectional and longitudinal methodologies. The six types of memory and the influence of verbal processing speed, nonverbal processing speed, and intelligence were examined in mixed-gender groups of 20 - 40 (n = 40, M = 30.7, SD = 5.52), 50 - 70 (n = 44, M = 59.2, SD = 4.94), and 85+ year olds (n = 42, M = 87.8, SD = 2.43), at two points, the second occurring two years after the first. Each participant completed tests of word recall, geometric shapes recall, short-term memory (digit span), working memory (letter-number sequencing), face recognition, and prospective memory. Additionally, there were two processing speed tasks (Identical Pictures and Finding As), and the National Adult Reading Test of verbal fluency was used to estimate intelligence. The Mini-Mental State Examination and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were used to screen for dementia and depression, respectively.At Time 1 testing the 85+ participants showed declines in all memory types (compared to the 20 - 40 year olds). Nonverbal recall (66.2% lower than the young group), working memory (46.2%), verbal recall (45%), and prospective memory (38.2%) produced the largest differences, short-term memory (12.3%) and face recognition (14.7%) the least. Two years later, the 85+ years old participants had shown further declines, relative to the 20 - 40 years group. Nonverbal recall (72.3% lower than the young group), prospective memory (63.2%), working memory (55.3%), and verbal recall (54.7%) continued to produce the largest decrements, with short-term memory (18.9%) and face recognition (19.8%) the least. The results for the young and middle participants did not change appreciably between Time 1 and Time 2. The difference between unadjusted scores and scores adjusted for intelligence, verbal processing speed, and nonverbal processing speed, increased markedly between Time 1 and Time 2 testing for the oldest-old participants.These findings support the view that while memory declines may be approximately linear from age 20 to 80 years, there is a sharp decline in most types of memory after the age of 85 years, recall and working memory suffering the most. Intelligence and processing speed have an effect on some types of memory, but age is by far the largest contributor to memory decline. Furthermore, as expected, all memory types declined over the two-year period, with prospective memory, verbal recall, nonverbal recall, and working memory showing the greatest declines. Short-term memory and face recognition declined at a noticeably slower rate.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effects of aging</field><field name="subject">short-term memory</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">face recognition</field><field name="subject">prospective memory</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="subject">380106 Developmental psychology and ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross-cultural content analysis of the portrayal of food and nutrition, in television advertising and programmes in New Zealand and Japan : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MBS in Marketing at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, Jacinta</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the food-related messages that are presented to children on New Zealand and Japanese television. A sample of 25 programmes, including advertisements broadcast on New Zealand's main free-to-air network stations and a sample of 22 programmes, including advertisements broadcast on Japan's network stations were the basis of this study. Food-related messages, content and portrayed eating behaviours were analysed. The main finding of this study suggest that the advertising content of children's programmes contain a large proportion of food advertising, largely for foods high in fat and sugar. The children's programming environments in both New Zealand and Japan also contain a large proportion of food imagery, which does include a variety of healthy foods such as meat, rice, bread, fruit and vegetables. Of more concern is that whilst Japanese children are mainly watching children's programmes, in New Zealand, children are exposed to numerous unhealthy food related imagery during programmes of which they are heavy viewers, although they are not the target audience, i.e. peak viewing periods, typically 6pm -10:30pm daily. Furthermore the unhealthy eating imagery during peak viewing periods may be contributing towards shaping children's nutrition practices. It is recommended that marketers and policy makers consider these issues in regard to the claims that advertising is a contributing factor to obesity. Due to the high incidence of eating behaviours occurring during programme content it is recommended that an advertising ban during children's programmes in New Zealand and Japan would be inconsistent, ineffective and unjustifiable.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advertising and Children</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Marketing and public policy</field><field name="subject">Advertising restrictions</field><field name="subject">New Zealand and Japan</field><field name="subject">Television</field><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A macroeconometric analysis of foreign aid in economic growth and development in least developed countries : a case study of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (1978-2001) : a dissertation presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Economics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Xayavong, Vilaphonh</field><field name="description">Despite receiving large quantities of aid, many developing countries, especially the Least Developed Countries, have remained stagnant and became more aid-dependent. This grim reality provokes vigorous debate on the effectiveness of aid. This study re-examines the effectiveness of aid, focusing on the ongoing debate on the interactive effect of aid and policy conditionality on sustainable economic growth. A theoretical model of the aid-growth nexus was developed to explain why policy conditionality attached to aid may not always promote sustainable economic growth. Noticeable methodological weaknesses in the aid fungibility and aid-growth models have led to the construction of two macroeconometric models to tackle and reduce these weaknesses. The Lao People's Democratic Republic's economy for the 1978-2001 period has been used for a case study.It is argued that the quality of policy conditionality and the recipient country's ability to complete specified policy conditions are the main factors determining the effectiveness of aid. Completing the policy prescriptions contributes to a stable aid inflow. The aid-growth nexus model developed in this study shows that stable and moderate aid inflow boosts economic growth even when aid is fungible. However, failure to complete the policy conditionality owing to inadequate policy design and problems of policy mismanagement caused by lack of state and institutional capability in the recipient country triggers an unstable aid inflow. The model shows that unstable aid flows reduce capital accumulation and economic growth in the recipient country. These empirical findings reveal that policy conditionality propagated through the "adjustment programmes" has mitigated the side effects of aid fungibility and "Dutch disease" in the case of the Lao PDR. Preliminary success in implementing the policy conditions in the pre-1997 period led to a stable aid inflow and contributed to higher economic growth. This favourable circumstance, however, was impaired by unstable aid flow in the post-1997 period. The lack of state and institutional capacity in the Lao PDR and the inadequate policy design to deal with external shocks triggered the instability of aid inflow, which in turn exacerbated the negative effects of the Asian financial crisis on the Lao PDR's economy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">foreign aid</field><field name="subject">economic growth</field><field name="subject">least developed countries</field><field name="subject">Lao People's Democratic Republic</field><field name="subject">macroeconometric</field><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Yeast metabolism in fresh and frozen dough : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Miller, Simon Derek</field><field name="description">Author also know as S M Loveday</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breadmaking</field><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="subject">frozen food</field><field name="subject">fermentation</field><field name="subject">mathematical model</field><field name="subject">frozen dough</field><field name="subject">321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instructional and improvisational models of music therapy with adolescents who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) : a comparison of the effects on motor impulsivity : a thesis presented to fulfil the requirements for the degree of Master of Music Therapy at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rickson, Daphne Joan</field><field name="description">This study compared the impact of instructional and improvisational music therapy approaches on the level of motor impulsivity displayed by adolescent boys who have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Measures included numbers of errors made on a Synchronised Tapping Task (STT); and Conners' Rating Scales (Conners, 1997). Participants (n=13), aged 11 - 16 years, were enrolled in a special residential school. A combination of a multiple contrasting treatment and an experimental control group design was used. Students were randomised to three groups; control (Group A) and two treatment groups. Students in Group B received eight sessions of improvisational music therapy followed by eight sessions of instructional music therapy, while the order was reversed for Group C.There was no statistical difference between the impacts of the contrasting music therapy approaches on the level of motor impulsivity displayed by the students as measured by the STT and the Restless-Impulsive and Hyperactive-Impulsive Conners' subscales. However all students significantly improved on the STT across each phase of treatment and improvement was slightly greater during the instructional treatment periods for both groups. During these same periods teachers reported a small decrease in restless and impulsive behaviours. The results therefore cautiously imply that the instructional approach might contribute to a reduction in motor impulsivity in the classroom.Significant improvement on STT without the corresponding improvement in motor impulsivity suggested that increased accuracy on the STT might be attributable to progress in other developmental domains. Teacher report of significant improvement for treatment groups on the DSM-IV Total Subscale adds weight to this suggestion, and implies that combined music therapy approaches might have contributed to a reduction in DSM-IV symptomology in the classroom.Rickson's (2001) tentative suggestion that creative music-making might over-arouse students with ADHD was not confirmed. Students did make more errors when tested on the STT a second time on the same day but this was regardless of whether they had been involved in instructional, improvisational or no music therapy programme. It is possible that students who have ADHD are easily aroused by the general school milieu and classroom or music room interactions with peers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy</field><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">impulsivity</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">timing</field><field name="subject">410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood brothers &amp; southern men : engaging with alcohol advertising in Aotearoa : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Cherrington, Jane</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to develop a robust methodological translation of the insights of 'culturalist' theoretical positions in communications studies as an alternative through which to approach contemporary media research. The focus is on engagements with alcohol advertising. In Aotearoa/New Zealand, as internationally, there is a significant body of publicly-funded research examining how alcohol advertising affects audiences. However, this thesis contends that important questions need to be asked about the adequacy of these (dominantly positivist) investigations. A review of local research identifies that in theoretical and methodological terms the majority of these studies are riddled with tensions and contradictions. In addition, when located within the context of wider developments in contemporary communication studies, an important epistemological gap is highlighted as requiring attention and debate. Comparison of this local review with international studies highlights similar concerns, particularly around 'effects' driven research, the adequacy of dominant positivist models, and the need to examine epistemological alternatives that can encompass meta, meso, and micro forms of enquiry. A discursive-theoretical approach is then argued as an epistemological alternative that is highly congruent with contemporary communication studies, which, if more robustly translated through methodology and method, could provide a very solid 'culturalist' alternative framework for media research. Taking a contrastive, multi-voiced, context-based approach, the present research focuses on connections, divergences, or disjunctions between different participants' interpretations of, and responses to, themes, ideas and positions they perceive as existing in the ad-texts, and themes and ideas on offer about alcohol in the wider social context. Using a methodology I describe as 'Discursive Sonar', this research highlights the socially located, interpretative complexity of advertising engagements. By unpacking that complexity, this project identifies how, and why, media engagements vary for different participants (including that of the reflexively engaged participant researcher). By locating the interactions between participants and ad-texts within the context of wider struggles over meanings around alcohol in Aotearoa/New Zealand the research shows ways in which both ad-texts and participants reflect, employ, and debate those wider struggles. I contrasted and compared individual participant interactions with the content and themes they identify in response to the ad-texts, with what producers intended those texts to communicate, and also with the views of the other participants. Through these analyses key textual 'mechanisms' become apparent as determining why and how engagements can be closely shared or variable between people and groups. Focusing on diversity and variance in engagements highlights cultural shifts around how alcohol is understood in Aotearoa/New Zealand, as well as significant alterations in views between the generations involved in the project. Focusing on commonalities across engagements identifies how 'interpretative communities' can be produced through textual responses, which are in turn engendered in response to commonly held constructs such as gender and age. This project succeeds in two ways. As well succeeding in significantly developing existing 'operationalisation' of discursive theory, it also constructs a viable discursive framework through which to approach media research. It is suggested that further development of this alternative might move us beyond the barriers of abstraction and effects in media research to examine the ways in which media and other dominant discursive forms interact, and are interacted with, to shape choices in our social worlds.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discourse</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Advertising</field><field name="subject">Discursive Theory</field><field name="subject">Media studies</field><field name="subject">Qualitative Research</field><field name="subject">380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shards of teacher and curriculum development in four New Zealand secondary schools : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">O'Neill, John</field><field name="description">This study examines teacher and curriculum development in the period of intense curriculum policy reform of the mid-1990s.

The accounts are contextualised within the history, politics and culture of New Zealand secondary schooling since the Thomas Report on the Post-Primary school Curriculum in 1943, and parallel developments in secondary schooling in other anglophone countries.The study attempts to understand the workgroup, organisational and systemic constraints within which secondary school teachers conduct their work and how they seek to exercise their individual and collective agency in order to gain more control and knowledge of their occupational circumstances. The study links contemporary dilemmas of practice to longer standing, embedded tensions of curriculum content, pedagogy and assessment. It identifies continuities and discontinuities of secondary schooling practice in the decades since the 1940s and shows how contemporary policy options and proposed solutions are simply the latest staging post in a protracted sequence of political efforts to solve 'problems' of curriculum and credentialing. In some respects, the official policy texts introduced in the 1990s spoke directly to teachers, own pragmatic concerns and aspirations. Thus, in this study, teachers and curriculum leaders engaged creatively and energetically with the challenges posed by school-based Unit Standards trials because they appeared to offer the opportunity to end secondary teachers' long search for meaningful alternatives to examination dominated schemes of work, assessments and credentials. However, curriculum innovation always took place alongside other day-to-day routines and seasonal patterns of work. For curriculum leaders in this study, these multiple demands meant that any potential benefits of voluntary curriculum innovation had constantly to be weighed against its costs in terms of other workgroup priorities, the energies and dispositions of fellow workgroup members and their personal health and well-being.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">education policy</field><field name="subject">330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shiftwork in air traffic services : coping strategies and well-being : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Signal, T. Leigh</field><field name="description">It is becoming widely recognised that shiftwork has significant implications for the health, safety and quality of life of shiftworkers.  To date, little research has been carried out on how individuals cope with the problems caused by shiftwork and how effective coping strategies maintain their health and well-being.  It has been proposed, by Monk (1994), that there are a number of aspects of a shiftworker's life which are important in determining the ability of an individual to cope with shiftwork.  These factors are an individual's circadian rhythms, sleep patterns, and social and domestic situation.  Further literature also suggests that workplace factors and coping style are an important part of tolerating shiftwork.  The primary aim of the present study was to determine which factors are important in predicting the physical and mental well-being of Air Traffic Services staff working on shifts.  It was hypothesised that individuals who are evening types, have few social, domestic, sleep, and work place difficulties will be physically and mentally healthy.  In addition, it was hypothesised that the use of engagement strategies in dealing with shiftwork related problems will relate to better physical and mental health.  To test the hypotheses, 183 Air Traffic Services staff from Melbourne centre, Australia were surveyed by questionnaire.  The results of the regressions showed that physical health was predicted by variables from each of the five areas considered; circadian typology, the social and domestic situation, work place factors, sleep patterns and coping style.  Mental well-being was best predicted by a single domestic variable, which is the extent to which shiftwork caused domestic problems and the two coping variables of engagement and disengagement.  The results support the suggestion that in order for an individual to be able to tolerate shiftwork they must have strategies in place to help them deal with the effect of shiftwork variables on a range of factors in their lives.  An additional aim of the present study was to determine the reliability of a questionnaire for use with Air Traffic Services staff.  This was due to a lack of suitable questionnaires for use in this occupational context.  Overall the items in the questionnaire were found to have acceptable reliability, although the collection of sleep data by subjective reporting is not recommended.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air traffic control</field><field name="subject">shiftwork</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">physical health</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">sleep</field><field name="subject">380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He huarahi motuhake : the politics of tribal agency in provider services : submitted in fulfilment of the requirement of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Te P&#363;tahi a Toi, School of M&#257;ori Studies, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jahnke, Huia</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the nature of tribal service provision, in particular the characteristics that distinguish tribal provider services. An indigenous research paradigm, M&#228;ori philosophical traditions and tribal histories provide the context for researching and theorising about the three tribal organisations upon which this study is based. The thesis argues that tribal authorities emerged not only as a response to state policies of devolution but also as ongoing expressions of self-determination. How tribal organisational bureaucracies were established historically provides the context for examining the interface between tribal organisations and the state. In particular, specific historical events leading up to the 1840 annexation of New Zealand by Britain that demonstrate British assumptions of authority, humanitarian ideals and interventions by state functionaries in the affairs of New Zealand.A discussion on the nature of the state as the basis for Eurocentric bias in modern constitutionalism offers a platform for understanding the art of government. Four interconnecting themes give a systematic basis for exploring the distinctive characteristics of tribal provider services that emerged as significant in this study; 'ng&#228; mahi a ng&#228; tangata' examines advocacy, responsiveness and relevancy. 'Ng&#228; mahi m&#228; te iwi' considers how links to the M&#228;ori communities are constituted relative to wh&#228;nau, hap&#252; and marae. 'Ng&#228; mahi a ng&#228; tipuna' explores how culture counts and the place of M&#228;ori culture and traditions in the workplace. 'Ng&#228; mahi tuara' examines cultural frameworks located within M&#228;ori philosophical and customary practices and traditions.Finally, an analysis is given of the contracting environment and the counterstrategies employed by the participants in this study in countering the limitations imposed by the terms of state contracts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori development</field><field name="subject">Maori service provision</field><field name="subject">indigenous governance</field><field name="subject">indigenous studies</field><field name="subject">420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity viewed askew : a debate with special reference to a feminist theological organisation : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology, Department of Social and Cultural Studies, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Leggatt-Cook, Chez</field><field name="description">A critical task in the formation of any political group is the determination and articulation of group identity, purpose and goals.  In holding that identity is impervious to capture, much poststructuralist thought has little to contribute to an understanding of the precise processes and ongoing tensions involved in such drives for representation.  The essentialism debate in feminist theory, for instance, has been primarily concerned with determining which conceptualisation of women's subjectivity will best facilitate feminism's political goals.  However, under the influential feminist deconstructive perspective, a dilemma emerges regarding how an anti-essentialist notion of femininity might be reconciled with the essentialism required for a distinctly feminist voice.  Alternatively, post-Lacanian psychoanalysis views subjectivity as an effect of fundamentally irresolvable antagonisms in language, allowing the emphasis to shift from the (attempted) reconciliation of irresolvable tensions to the identification of mechanisms that work to conceal those tensions, thereby permitting a sense of subjectivity to be articulated.  This thesis explores the methodological implications of these theoretical debates, examining how the psychoanalytic line of questioning might be used to analyse feminist identity in an empirical setting.  Research was conducted with the Women's Resource Centre (WRC) based in Auckland, New Zealand, an organisation originally established to provide feminist theology resources to women undergoing theological education.  Using a conversational methodology and the observation of material expressions of identity, the research attempts to view the Centre's identity 'askew.'  In doing so, it considers the creative yet eventually regressive impact of the postmodern privileging of difference and multiplicity on the feminist identity of the Centre.  Referring specifically to the changing expression of the Centre's identity (in promotional material, funding applications and the WRC Story), the thesis traces the effects of ideological tension (in incorporating more inclusive notions of justice with feminist politics) and organisational change (dispersion of the original community, high staff turnover, shift in organisational culture, funding difficulties).  Wider implications of the research for voluntary and feminist organisations are indicated, along with an evaluation of post-Lacanian psychoanalysis for the empirical study of identity and for the overarching theoretical concerns of the thesis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational identity</field><field name="subject">Feminist identity</field><field name="subject">Group identity</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">Zizek</field><field name="subject">370106 Sociological methodology and research methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Determinants of Global 'Social Production' of Information and Knowledge: Insights from SETI@home</field><field name="creator">Engelbrecht, Hans-Juergen</field><field name="description">Commons-based peer production is an activity that is emerging as a distinct mode of resource allocation and production of information, knowledge and culture ('social production' for short), potentially heralding a new stage in the development of information/knowledge-based economies.

Even at the broader level of the labour market there continues an underlying association of youth with employment while the experiences of mature workers have been largely minimised, especially in New Zealand.  This study examines the job-seeking activities and experiences of mature job-seekers in the New Zealand labour market from a political economy perspective.Issues surrounding mature workers have lacked a theoretical and disciplinary "base" with the issues of retirement and health consistently overwhelming any discussion about mature people and employment.  The political economy theory of aging does provide a useful explanatory framework given the struggle for recognition and resources of mature workers.  The persistent exclusion of mature workers from any discussion about the labour market in New Zealand is a common theme throughout the present study.As mature workers become increasingly "problematised" by economists as a threat to future economic productivity; issues surrounding mature employment need to be better understood because there will be greater proportions of mature workers and mature job-seekers.  Through a sample of 947 mature jobs-seekers collected by MESA offices throughout New Zealand, issues surrounding mature job-seekers in particular were examined.The results highlight both the different and similar experiences of men and women in the New Zealand labour market.  Women respondents were more likely to present themselves as younger than men, and to be returning to the labour market after family responsibilities with lesser confidence in their job-seeking skills and occupational abilities.  Men by contrast presented themselves at MESA as older and more likely to have been made redundant; they also appeared to have more confidence in their job-seeking and occupational skills.  Gender, however, did little to explain the primarily formal job-seeking methods used and the effort expended job-seeking.  There is little to suggest that job-seeking efforts diminish significantly with age.  Only with the final cohort of age 61 years and over, was mean job-search effort significantly less than for other age-cohorts.  By contrast the variable time out of work explained much of the variance with job-search peaking at six months out of work.  Subsequent analysis strongly supports the suggestion that any policy intervention will have the greatest impact within the first four to six months of unemployment.There is also some evidence to suggest that the reason for becoming a mature job-seeker and the attributions these mature job-seekers make for their unemployment is associated with their job-search efforts.  In the present study those mature job-seekers made compulsorily redundant, regardless of age or gender, clearly tried harder than other job-seekers.  By contrast those job-seekers who indicated they had been dismissed gave less effort to their job-search.The primary barrier identified by mature job-seekers is silence, silence from employers or employment agencies about why they have not been considered or rejected for work.  As a consequence many mature job-seekers interpreted this silence as age discrimination.  Understandably mature job-seekers are reluctant to see their lack of skills or experience as contributing to their circumstance and feel disappointed that their skills are not appreciated: a point well highlighted by the qualitative analysis "Trajectory of emotion" that captures the voice of participants in the present study.  Finally, paid employment does matter to mature people and future research and policy would do well to examine the full picture of the labour market and give attention to where real needs exist.  Mature job-seekers in the present study did not necessarily seek "special" treatment but rather the same opportunities as their chronologically younger colleagues to make a contribution to New Zealand society through paid work.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Middle aged persons</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Age discrimination in employment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The currency of heroic fantasy : The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter from ideology to industry : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philsophy in English at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Beatty, Bronwyn</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes that the current popularity of heroic fantasy arises from the genre's capacity to reveal "meaning" to the alienated subject within late modernity. While consumerism potentially undermines the subject's sense of stability both as an individual and as a member of a coherent and unified social group, the hero's journey conveys a compelling model for attaining a purposive subjectivity by acting on behalf of the broader community. However, this "healing" message is in turn appropriated by multinational corporations and nation states for financial advantage. Heroic fantasy can thus be read at various points of its production and consumption as both legitimating and contesting dominant institutions and ideologies.With particular reference to the books and films of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, ontological security is discussed at both individual and collective levels across three horizons: commodification, gender, and nationalism. A combination of close textual analysis and the application of core concepts from cultural studies - particularly ethnographic study, hegemonic power relations and political economy - provides the methodological flexibility necessary to trace consumers' contradictory and ambivalent responses to the three themes: the anti-materialist message incorporated in the genre's moral economy is jeopardised by the rampant commodification of the texts; the normative masculinity and emphasised femininity common to the genre is contested by female readers; and the utopic visions of a secure and homogeneous community are exploited by the New Zealand government rebranding the country as Middle-earth. These arguments are oriented toward a New Zealand perspective; interviews with readers of Harry Potter and a discussion of the World Premiere of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Return of the King in "Wellywood" contribute to this specific context.This thesis therefore asserts that once heroic fantasy is placed in the contexts of production and reception conflicting trends are revealed, suggesting that the social impacts of heroic fantasy are complex and equivocal. Although the genre is readily commodified by the very system that it retaliates against, analysis suggests that heroic fantasy resists reification into a single dominant discourse as appropriation is never absolute.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lord of the Rings</field><field name="subject">Harry Potter</field><field name="subject">heroic fantasy</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">commodification</field><field name="subject">brand Middle Earth</field><field name="subject">420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I write therefore I am : rewriting the subject in "The yellow wallpaper" and The singing detective : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in English at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Beatty, Bronwyn</field><field name="description">Focusing on "The Yellow Wallpaper" (1892) by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and The Singing Detective (1986) by Dennis Potter in dialogue with theories from Freud, Szasz, Foucault and Butler, my thesis considers the role of medicine in encouraging a patient toward a normative subjectivity.  The protagonists of each text have become ill as a result of their inability to accept the social contradictions and lies upon which gendered subjectivity is reliant; the unnamed narrator of "The Yellow Wallpaper" comprehends femininity as servitude to male demands, while Marlow of The Singing Detective desires the power patriarchy offers him as a male, but his loss of belief and faith prevent his ascension to masculine status.Both the narrator of "The Yellow Wallpaper" and Marlow resist the imposition of normative gender by practitioners of mainstream medicine.  Therefore, a more complex and subtle method of treatment, the psychoanalysis developed by Freud, is employed in The Singing Detective, thereby encouraging the patient to identify illness and discontent as personal, not societal, responsibility.I commence the thesis with an overview of the unequal power relations presupposed and encouraged by medical discourse.  Through a process of 'hystericisation' the patient is infantilised and made dependent upon medical care.  Linguistic control is central to manipulating patient behaviour within the hospital, and correspondingly the narrator of "The Yellow Wallpaper" and Marlow both seek a new subjectivity through their writing. Difficulties in appropriating language leads to internal incoherency for the protagonists, met by a split subjectivity - a defence mechanism which allows the protagonists to deviate from, at the same time as preserving, their 'good self'.The refusal of "The Yellow Wallpaper's" narrator to relinquish her defiant self and assume femininity is contained by patriarchy - embodied by her husband, John - as insanity.  The strict limitation upon a nineteenth-century woman's expression prevents her from positively escaping her physician/husband's script leading to her mental demise.  By contrast, Marlow successfully resocialises himself by modifying the hypermasculine persona he idealises, and is finally situated to confront and reform the social contradictions that precipitated his ill-health.  However, subdued by having been led to  identify discontent as a personal problem, Marlow is unlikely to challenge the power relations which have made his subjectivity possible.  His capitulation to normalisation demonstrates a fundamental point linking the otherwise divergent theories of Freud and Foucault, that the creation of agency first requires the subject's subordination.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Yellow Wallpaper</field><field name="subject">The Singing Detective</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="subject">power relations</field><field name="subject">psychoanalytic interpretation</field><field name="subject">Literature, English (0593)</field><field name="subject">420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He moana pukepuke e ekengia e te waka persevering with citizenship education in Aotearoa : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tawhai, Veronica</field><field name="description">This thesis examines citizenship education in Aotearoa New Zealand. In particular, it reviews what education there is in the New Zealand curriculum about Aotearoa's democratic arrangements, including the provisions for the political voices of Maori. Recent political debate suggested the reform of these provisions through a citizensinitiated referendum. This thesis sought to identify what formal education is provided to citizens to inform their response in such a referendum. Critical discourse analysis and a content analysis method were utilised to analyse data. A review of the social studies curriculum revealed some citizenship education material in education, but a distinct neglect of issues about the Maori-Pakeha relationship as they relate to Aotearoa's bipolitical democracy. For example, there is an absence of material about the Maori Electoral Option. This thesis contributes to the calls for the strengthening of citizenship education in Aotearoa. It does so by affirming the benefits of such education to Aotearoa's democracy, through the empowerment of citizens to engage in democratic society. Such a citizenship education is posed through the concepts of presence, freedom, and critical consciousness from a Maori world-view (Te Ao Marama).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Citizenship Education</field><field name="subject">Race Relations</field><field name="subject">Rangatiratanga</field><field name="subject">Self-determination</field><field name="subject">420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The agile methods : an analytical comparison of five agile methods and an investigation of their target environment : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Information Sciences in Information Systems at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Strode, Diane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study defines the systems development methodologies named agile methods and investigates the environmental conditions where agile methods are most suitable.  A definition of agile methods was developed using an analytical comparativeframework to investigate five of the earliest published agile methods; Dynamic SystemsDevelopment Method, Extreme Programming, Scrum, Adaptive Software Development,and Crystal Methods. The framework decomposed each method into its componentparts; philosophy, models, techniques, tools, scope, outputs, practice, and the extent towhich the method may be adapted to a situation. Based on this analysis and a literaturereview, a theoretical model of the target environment for agile methods was developed.This theoretical model is a proposed set of organisation, people, project, technology,and domain factors that relate to the successful use of an agile method.A mixed method research methodology was used. A qualitative design, consisting ofpositivist case studies, was used to test the theoretical model.  Data was gathered fromnine software development projects, both agile and non-agile, using questionnaires andinterviews of project leaders. Then cross-case analysis was carried out on each projectfactor in the theoretical model. The relationship between environmental factors andagile method usage was investigated using non-parametric quantitative data analysis.This led to a revised model of the target environment for agile methods. The empiricaldata showed that specific organisational culture factors correlate with effective use of anagile method. These include the organisational characteristics of feedback and learning,teamwork, empowerment of people, collaboration, leadership, loyalty, and a resultsorientedculture that values entrepreneurship, innovation and risk taking.This research is significant for method users, those carrying out empirical research into agile methods, and those carrying out studies of systems development methodologies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agile methods</field><field name="subject">systems development methodologies</field><field name="subject">extreme programming</field><field name="subject">software development methodologies</field><field name="subject">XP</field><field name="subject">280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross-cultural content analysis of the portrayal of food and nutrition, in television advertising and programmes in New Zealand and Japan : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MBS in Marketing at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, Jacinta</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the food-related messages that are presented to children on New Zealand and Japanese television. A sample of 25 programmes, including advertisements broadcast on New Zealand's main free-to-air network stations and a sample of 22 programmes, including advertisements broadcast on Japan's network stations were the basis of this study. Food-related messages, content and portrayed eating behaviours were analysed. The main finding of this study suggest that the advertising content of children's programmes contain a large proportion of food advertising, largely for foods high in fat and sugar. The children's programming environments in both New Zealand and Japan also contain a large proportion of food imagery, which does include a variety of healthy foods such as meat, rice, bread, fruit and vegetables. Of more concern is that whilst Japanese children are mainly watching children's programmes, in New Zealand, children are exposed to numerous unhealthy food related imagery during programmes of which they are heavy viewers, although they are not the target audience, i.e. peak viewing periods, typically 6pm -10:30pm daily. Furthermore the unhealthy eating imagery during peak viewing periods may be contributing towards shaping children's nutrition practices. It is recommended that marketers and policy makers consider these issues in regard to the claims that advertising is a contributing factor to obesity. Due to the high incidence of eating behaviours occurring during programme content it is recommended that an advertising ban during children's programmes in New Zealand and Japan would be inconsistent, ineffective and unjustifiable.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advertising and Children</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Marketing and public policy</field><field name="subject">Advertising restrictions</field><field name="subject">New Zealand and Japan</field><field name="subject">Television</field><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating a group of New Zealand leaders : their roots of, routes to, and routines in leadership : a ... research report ... presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management at Massey University</field><field name="creator">McLeod-Jones, David</field><field name="description">Zaleznik (1977) addressing &#8220;Development of leadership&#8221; in Managers and leaders: Are they different? states that, &#8220;The development of every person begins in the family . . .

Apart from obvious benefits for their children this liaison has also been important for mothers through gains in parenting knowledge, increased confidence and personal wellbeing. The present study argues that this is pertinent to appropriate and focused support being crucial for mothers at the life stage of adjustment to early parenting when disruption of networks has occurred. As well, it reflects the responsibility of institutions such as early childhood centres to fulfil these needs in a society where traditional support has fragmented.  The study was designed to explore ways in which support mechanisms operated in four different early childhood services, through the medium of interviews. The unique findings in the study culminated in six propositions that showed support to be a product of mothers&#8217; own activity in building relationships and contributing to their centre community. At the same time irrespective of service type all centres operated upon the basis of both formal and informal systems of support. Consequently, whilst mothers&#8217; activities were most favoured by socially co-operative environments, they were opportunists in both systems.  However, of major concern was that the informal systems were the most effective, as the statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices (Ministry of Education, 1996) exhorts staff to consider parent interactions as partnerships and The Strategic Plan for Early Childhood Education (Ministry of Education, 2002) has a vision of socially co-operative practices. Teachers rather than being unwilling to establish more collaborative styles of leadership were hampered by a lack of confidence in working with parents. Difficulties were the consequence of professional attitudes to trained knowledge, unmodified by the benefits of training to facilitate adults. Addressing these issues will not only help teachers to develop more collaborative systems that will facilitate support for mothers, but it will also ensure partnerships that make better use of their services to the mutual benefit of early childhood centre communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">support for mothers</field><field name="subject">parenting support</field><field name="subject">early childhood centres</field><field name="subject">330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A knowledge creation approach to environmental education in early childhood : creating a community of learners : this thesis is submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the Doctor of Education, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Prince, Cynthia Margaret</field><field name="description">The study investigated the creation of a community of learners to integrate environmental education into early childhood curriculum.  Two centres were used for the study (one kindergarten, one childcare centre).  The participants were four kindergarten teachers, eight childcare staff, along with five focus group parents and six focus children from each centre.  The qualitative research was conducted in two phases over one year.  In phase one a case study approach was employed to allow teachers to gain confidence in the research process. During this time a two week environmental education integrated curriculum was implemented at both centres.  At the conclusion of phase one a nascent community of learners was emerging. After a transition stage when the research was shared with the researcher, the teachers at both centres made the decision to lead the research in phase two using a participatory action research approach.  This resulted in a growth in professional knowledge of research processes.  The teachers aimed to collaboratively create a community of learners with the parents by valuing their involvement, social capital and funds of knowledge.  A project approach to environmental education based on children&#8217;s environmental interests, the emergent curriculum, and the use of documentation was implemented at both centres.  A conceptual artefact in the form of a community of learners was created. Bereiter&#8217;s knowledge creation metaphor and the sociological concepts of parental social capital and funds of knowledge guided the data analysis.  Environmental knowledge creation by all participants in the community of learners was a significant finding.

The TF-CBT protocol was based on: (1) a review of the history of child abuse (CA) and child protection in New Zealand and internationally, with particular reference to professional developments and the role of psychologists in ameliorating CA; (2) a conceptualisation of the clinical presentation of CA in children; (3) a review of the field of psychotraumatology and theoretical models, including locally developed, relevant to the development of a treatment programme for traumatised abused children in a child protection setting in New Zealand; and (4) a review of evidence-based practice, treatment outcome models, and current empirical research related to developing an effective treatment model in this area. The locally developed TF-CBT programme built on efficacious treatments for child anxiety and PTSD as a result of sexual abuse. It encompasses psychosocial strengthening, coping skills training, gradual exposure using expressive modalities, and special issues relevant to trauma and abuse. A &#8220;scientist-practitioner&#8221; approach to local clinical research was used to evaluate the programme. A single-case multiple-baseline design demonstrated the controlling effects of the treatment across four studies; each comprising four typically-referred multiply-abused children aged 9-15 years who met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Parent/caregivers were involved in treatment sessions. Study 1 was a pilot with four Pakeha/New Zealand European children; Study 2 trialled the protocol with two Maori and two Samoan children; Study 3 was an evaluation of the developed protocol with a multicultural group of typically-referred children; and Study 4 was an evaluation with other therapists delivering the manualised programme. Despite some methodological difficulties related to conducting research in a setting of this nature, the overall results indicate a good deal of promise. Across the four studies, for the majority of children treated, PTSD symptoms decreased and child coping increased. Where follow-up data was available, gains generally maintained or improved over 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. Recommendations are made about further applications of this TF-CBT programme, including the interweaving of cultural models with TF-CBT, and development and evaluation of the protocol in other settings. Implications of the current research are discussed in terms of recognition of the crucial importance of evidence-based practice in CA/child protection settings, and the contribution psychologists and therapists can make to ensure quality outcomes for this most vulnerable population of children and families.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy</field><field name="subject">posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">child abuse</field><field name="subject">psychotraumatology</field><field name="subject">child protection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Funds of knowledge in early childhood communities of inquiry : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hedges, Helen Dorothy</field><field name="description">Inquiry is a fundamental human undertaking. The present study investigated interests-based curriculum and pedagogy in early childhood education, through the creation of a community of inquiry between children, teachers and a researcher. In two case study settings, it explored ways teachers and children co-construct interests based curriculum and ways teachers might strengthen coherence between research, theory, practice and professional learning to support such curriculum construction. During year-long fieldwork, the researcher drew on participant observation techniques, interviews, documentation and co-constructed inquiry discussions as sources of data. Data analysis occurred on two levels: descriptive and theoretical. Sociocultural theory provides a foundation for the approaches to learning and teaching, inquiry, the research design and lenses of interpretation. The study uses two frameworks to explain its findings, challenging and extending current understandings of funds of knowledge and communities of inquiry. In addition, it illuminates the concept of working theories. Discussion of the notion of evidence-informed inquiry explains some types of evidence teachers bring to the complexities of curriculum decision making as their funds of knowledge and working theories, thereby arguing against narrow interpretations of evidence-based practice. This thesis argues that interpretation of children's interests, from a sociocultural perspective, requires a more analytical understanding of children's family and community experiences and their impact on children's inquiry, and of teacher interests and responsibilities in relation to culturally-valued knowledge. Further, the thesis contends that children's and teachers' co-constructed inquiry is dependent on reciprocal and responsive pedagogical relationships that provide meaningful responses during engagement in learning-and-teaching. Links between everyday knowledge and conceptual knowledge in children's learning may be brought together. In this way, participatory learning enables children and teachers to co-create a foundation for conceptual learning. Two inquiry continua and one model are offered to incorporate the key theoretical ideas and arguments of the thesis. It is argued that the model represents components of an interests-based sociocultural curriculum and pedagogy. A funds of knowledge approach has the potential to transform early childhood learning-and-teaching environments, and implement partnerships with families, communities (including the research community) and cultures authentically. Implications for teaching practice, teachers' professional learning, research and policy are discussed to recognise and strengthen both an inquiry focus in pedagogical relationships, and an awareness of funds of knowledge in early childhood education contexts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community of inquiry</field><field name="subject">early childhood education</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">funds of knowledge</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical exploration of gender analysis : exploring the value and practice of gender analysis through engaging in gender analysis with communities and development staff in Vanuatu : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master of Philiosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kangisher, Joanna</field><field name="description">This research critically examines development project and programme Gender Analysis (GA) frameworks, trialing them with World Vision Vanuatu (WVV) staff and project communities. A Women&#8217;s Equality and Empowerment Framework (WEEF) analysis of the WVV country programme provided a visual overview of the programme, demonstrating that the organisation has a strong concern for women&#8217;s issues and were encouraging women&#8217;s empowerment. The programme could be improved by engaging in more conscientisation around gender issues. The Harvard Analytical Framework collected rich data on men and women in the communities and helped project staff to get to know the communities better. It also questioned the effectiveness of projects in dealing with gender issues, WVV need to provide equal opportunities for women at the project management level. The Gender Analysis Matrix (GAM) clearly showed project impacts for both men and women. One of the literacy projects had greatly benefited women, but could be improved by running separate classes for the men. The GAM results are not restricted to gender issues; the tool shows potential as a general monitoring framework. Experienced facilitators are needed to get the most out of the frameworks, however anyone can greatly benefit from utilising these tools. No GA framework can replace an awareness of gender issues and the will to work towards a fairer society. GA frameworks that are designed to empower the participants can deliberately or inadvertently be used in an extractive way, while frameworks that are labelled as extractive can be used creatively to empower those who take part. GA sessions provide rich data on gender in a relatively short period of time. While they risk not collecting enough information, the systematic collection and use of some information should help move development work forward.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender analysis</field><field name="subject">Vanuatu</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contesting development : the experience of female-headed households in Samoa : a dissertation presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stewart-Withers, Rochelle R.</field><field name="description">There is a plethora of development literature, both academic and policy oriented, that problematises female-headed households in normative ways, positioning them as socially isolated, stigmatised, lacking in agency and poor, equated with the &#8216;feminisation of poverty&#8217;. Through positioning female-headed households as &#8216;other&#8217; there is also a notable lack of regard for the diverse socio-political and cultural context which within female-headed households reside. By situating this research within a feminist postdevelopment framework, and through the use of participatory methodologies and the articulation of individual biographies of the development experience, this dissertation seeks to re-position our understanding of the development experience of female-headed households. Drawing on the case of Samoa, this study demonstrates how fa&#8217;asamoa (the Samoan way), inclusive of fa&#8217;amatai (customary system of governance), the feagaiga (brother/sister relationship) and the practice of fa&#8217;alavelave (demonstrating love and concern), all support the welfare and wellbeing of female-headed households, including any children born of these households. They also afford women in female-headed households a certain level of voice and agency. The thesis further highlights that the category of female-headed households was not well understood within Samoa because neither villagers nor policy makers labelled women in this way. Rather, women were recognised in relation to the cultural framework of fa&#8217;asamoa which situates them in terms of their position within their family, their natal village and the wider community. This illustrates the importance of culture when attempting to frame the development experiences of female-headed households in any part of the world. Development researchers and practitioners need to seriously question just how useful the practice of categorising and labelling is to Development Studies. In highlighting the problematic nature of universal labels and categories, this thesis concludes that the starting point of analysis for female-headed households needs to begin with the sociopolitical-cultural context, as opposed to the category of female-headed households. Shifting beyond a desire to uncritically categorise and label will provide a space for envisioning new approaches to development thinking and practice, and for truly seeing the ways that people struggle, often successfully, to create and pursue opportunities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Samoa</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">female-headed households</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laugh out loud : how organisational culture influences workplace humour : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment for the degree of Ph. D. in Management at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Plester, Barbara Anne</field><field name="description">Workplace humour is an important component of organisational culture and social behaviour, yet this topic is under-researched and neglected within the field of organisational studies. This thesis explores the influence of organisational culture on workplace humour enactment. Key research objectives are to contribute empirical data regarding the influence of organisational culture on humour and to create a model that explains and connects significant aspects of humour and organisational culture. A further aim is to explore the element of formality within organisational culture and its impacts on humour enactment. Research was undertaken in four New Zealand companies from different industries. A mixed-method approach is used and methods include: interviews; participant observation and document collection. An assessment tool was created to compare levels of formality and/or informality in the studied organisations. Findings show that the organisational culture and levels of formality and/or informality within the culture influence humour practices through the creation of boundaries that constrain or enable humour activities. A model was created to depict the influence of organisational culture upon humour enactment. The model shows that levels of formality or informality are key cultural elements and that formality/informality levels influence the boundaries that are created for humour enactment. Specific individuals (identified as either jokers or gatekeepers) assume dichotomous roles and within these roles either challenge or constrain the humour boundaries. Organisational members perceive that humour and organisational culture have both positive and negative impacts upon workplace outcomes such as: retention; satisfaction; performance and recruitment. Humour at work is widespread and a significant component of modern working life. Humour manifests itself within workplace culture and understanding the influence of organisational culture on humour enactment is an important facet of organisational studies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">workplace humour</field><field name="subject">formality</field><field name="subject">informality</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aid, education and adventure : an exploration of the impact of development scholarship schemes on women's lives : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctorate of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wild, Kirsten Leila</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the outcomes associated with women&#8217;s participation in development scholarship schemes. These schemes, which provide citizens from Third World countries with opportunities to undertake tertiary training abroad, have featured prominently within the development assistance programmes of many Western nations. However, the longer-term impact of this type of educational experience on the lives and communities of individuals who take up this form of aid remains under-studied. This is particularly the case for female development scholars, who have been both historically excluded from opportunities to take part in these schemes, as well as marginalised within academic evaluations of their outcomes. This research provides an in-depth qualitative exploration of the experiences of twenty women who have completed a tertiary qualification through a development scholarship scheme. The participant sample is diverse, and includes a group of New Zealand-based female doctoral students who have participated in several of these programmes, as well as two groups of women from Thailand who have returned home after taking part in a scholarship scheme funded by the New Zealand Agency for International Development. This research identifies a number of positive and negative outcomes for women associated with this distinct type of educational experience. Beneficial outcomes include greater emotional autonomy, increased cross-cultural knowledge, new professional networks, new work skills, and improved English-language competency. Participants within this research report that these benefits have translated into increased respect within their workplaces; new opportunities to represent their organisations at home and abroad; greater participation in international research and policy forums; increased control over negotiations with foreign consultants; and an enhanced commitment to collaboration with other professionals in the ASEAN region. Negative outcomes to arise out of the scholarship experience include role tension and relationship conflict for married women; career disruption associated with employment bonding and job restructuring during the period of absence abroad; new unwanted work responsibilities; and dissatisfaction with some aspects of quality of life in their country of origin. This thesis provides rich narrative material that increases our understanding of the concrete ways that this form of educational aid is &#8216;lived out&#8217; in the lives and communities of female development scholars.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">scholarship schemes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370107 Social change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IT capability, customer information handling, and privacy protection: a resource-based view of organisational performance : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Information Science in Information Systems at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tang, Yiyi</field><field name="description">What is the influence of Information Technology (IT) capability, and customer relationship management (CRM) capability on organisational information privacy protection behaviour, and ultimately how do these relationships impact on organizational performance? What are the relationships between different types of IT capabilities (i.e. outside-in, inside-out, and spanning capabilities) and how do they impact on performance (i.e. directly or indirectly)? This survey study attempted to answer these questions by empirically testing a research model based on the Resource Based-View (RBV) of the firm and the Comparative Advantage Theory of Competition to examine these relationships in the context of New Zealand firms engaged in IT supported CRM activities. RBV theory claims different subsets of a firm's resources (i.e. assets and capabilities) enable it to achieve initial and long-term competitive advantage (Barney, 1991). The role of different types of IS resources in achieving advantage has not been fully explored with some prior work finding evidence of direct effects but most finding only indirect effects of IS resources in general (Wade &amp; Hulland, 2004). In addition, Comparative Advantage Theory claims a comparative advantage in resources leads to a competitive advantage in market position which in turn leads to superior financial performance (Hunt &amp; Morgan, 1995). In turn, an organisation's use of customer information primarily for internal knowledge or external relationship building may be related to its privacy protection capability and how it measures performance (Greenaway &amp; Chan, 2005) but these propositions had not yet been empirically tested. A review of the Information Systems literature showed that very little prior work had been done on organisational level privacy protection behaviours. The findings from my study begin to address these gaps in the literature. This research makes the following contributions to the academic literature on CRM. First, it empirically tested proposals found in the literature which suggested considering information privacy protection as a resource based on claims made by RBV theory. Second, the research splits IS capabilities into three groups (IS inside-out capability, outside-in capability and spanning capability), splits CRM capabilities into two groups (customer knowledge capability and customer relating capability) and splits organisational performance into two groups (effectiveness and efficiency) in order to assess the role of privacy protection practice as a mediating mechanism between different IS and CRM capabilities and organisational performance outcomes. The response data was analysed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis based on the Partial Least Squares parameter estimation technique, a form of Structural Equation Modelling. The findings show inside-out (internally focused) IT capabilities have a weak negative direct effect on customer relating capability. However, this can be mediated by investing in IT outside-in and IT spanning capabilities which have a positive impact on customer relating capability. Interestingly, IT Outside-in (externally focused) capabilities had a direct positive influence on customer knowledge capability. This was unexpected as earlier work predicted this relationship would be mediated by IT spanning resources. As expected, a comparative advantage in customer knowledge capability had a moderate direct positive impact on efficiency, measured as financial performance. It also had a moderate direct positive impact on producing a comparative advantage in customer relating capability. This supports CRM theory which claims that a better understanding of customers based on collecting and processing customer information can lead to a better customer relating capability. But, as predicted, no relationship to privacy protection capability was found. In contrast, using IT to gain a comparative advantage in customer relating capability had a direct positive impact on establishing privacy protection behaviours that exceed guidelines. Treating privacy protection as a resource also appears to lead to greater effectiveness which in turn leads to greater efficiency. In addition to contributing empirical evidence to support the conditions under which the proposed theoretical model applied, the results had several implications for practice. First, the findings provide organisations with greater awareness of how others in their industry are using IT to support customer relating and customer knowledge capabilities and how safeguarding or not safeguarding information privacy contributes directly to effectiveness and indirectly improves financial performance. Second, the findings are useful for raising consumer awareness about actual organisational information privacy practices. Most organisations in New Zealand reported meeting or exceeding industry guidelines. If the reported safeguards are in place and fair information handling practices are being followed, awareness of the results may help to reduce the high levels of privacy concern reported in consumer surveys. Lastly, privacy protection capabilities have a positive impact on performance, giving organisations an incentive to implement them.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">customer relationship management</field><field name="subject">customer knowledge capability</field><field name="subject">privacy practices</field><field name="subject">resource-based view theory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Jacobi triple product, quintuple product, Winquist and Macdonald identities : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Abaz, Uros</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the infinite products. Here we provide a proof for representing sine function as an infinite product. This chapter also describes the notation used throughout the thesis as well as the method used to prove the identities. Each of the other chapters may be read independently, however some chapters assume familiarity with the Jacobi triple product identity. Chapter 2 is about the Jacobi triple product identity as well as several implications of this identity. In Chapter 3 the quintuple product identity and some of its special cases are derived. Even though there are many known proofs of this identity since 1916 when it was first discovered, the proof presented in this chapter is new. Some beautiful formulas in number theory are derived at the end of this chapter. The simplest two dimensional example of the Macdonald identity, A2, is investigated in full detail in Chapter 4. Ian Macdonald first outlined the proof for this identity in 1972 but omitted many of the details hence making his work hard to follow. In Chapters 5 and 6 we somewhat deviate from the method which uses the two specializations to evaluate the constant term and prove Winquist's identity and Macdonald's identity for G2. Some of the work involved in proving G2 identity is new. Finally in Chapter 7 we discuss the work presented with some concluding remarks as well as underlining the possibilities for the future research. Throughout the thesis we point to the relevant papers in this area which might provide different strategies for proving above identities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infinte products</field><field name="subject">Jacobi triple product identity</field><field name="subject">quintuple product identity</field><field name="subject">Macdonald identity</field><field name="subject">Winquist identity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230116 Numerical analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outsourcing versus in-house facilities management : framework for value adding selection : a research thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of  Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in Construction, Institute of Technology &amp; Engineering, College of Sciences, Massey University at Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kamarazaly, Myzatul Aishah</field><field name="description">Investment in the physical infrastructure and the provision of facilities management (FM) services should be geared toward achieving the strategic objectives of an organization, which largely aim at value creation. Sole focus on the financials while choosing between outsourcing and in-house FM options excludes other non-financial measures such as the extent to which the FM route contributes to improving internal business processes and the overall strategic health of the organization. This paper presents the results of investigations into a holistic perspective on the key variables to consider in choosing between outsourcing and in-house FM in order to provide value added service and improve organizational performance. The study was limited to the views expressed by facilities and property managers registered with the Property Institute of New Zealand Property and the Facilities Management Association of Australia. The descriptive survey method was used, which comprised qualitative data gathering using unstructured interviews and quantitative data gathering using structured questionnaires. Content analyses, multi-attribute methods and Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation tests were used in the analysis of the data and the testing of the research propositions/ hypotheses. Results showed that four broad categories constitute the holistic FM functional areas: strategic, operational, property development/project management and general services. Outsourcing was perceived to be more suited than in-house for providing operational, property development/ project management and general services; in-house was more suited for the provision of strategic FM functions. The relative importance of the value adding criteria underlying the broad categories of FM services, as well as the suitability of the use of outsourcing and in-house approaches in meeting each criterion were established. Using the concept of Overall Suitability Score, a process chart was developed for use in making a strategic choice between outsourcing and in-house FM service provisions. The use of this chart is recommended to property and facilities managers, and other stakeholders who may be faced with the dilemma of choosing between outsourcing and in-house approaches to providing FM services. The methodology developed in this study could be replicated in related contexts to resolving strategic decision dilemma involving making choices amongst competing alternatives.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">facilities management</field><field name="subject">outsourcing</field><field name="subject">property management</field><field name="subject">strategic management</field><field name="subject">in-house facilities management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290804 Construction engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of fault current limiters for power systems protection : a project report submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Institute of Information Sciences and Technology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Malhi, Gurjeet Singh</field><field name="description">In today&#8217;s technological world, electrical energy is one of the most important forms of energy and is needed directly or indirectly in almost every field. Increase in the demand and consumption of electrical energy leads to increase in the system fault levels. It is not possible to change the rating of the equipment and devices in the system or circuits to accommodate the increasing fault currents. The devices in electronic and electrical circuits are sensitive to disturbance and any disturbance or fault may damage the device permanently so that it must be replaced. The cost of equipment like circuit breakers and transformers in power grids is very expensive. Moreover, replacing damaged equipment is a time and labour consuming process, which also affects the reliability of power systems. It is not possible to completely eliminate the faults but it is possible to limit the current during fault in order to save the equipment and devices in the circuits or systems. One solution to this problem is to use a current limiting device in the system. There are many different types of approaches used for limiting fault currents Two different approaches to limit fault currents have been discussed by the author. One is Passive Magnetic Current Limiter (MCL) and another is High Temperature Superconductor Fault Current Limiter (HTSFCL). Both are passive devices and they do not need any sensor or external sources to perform their current limiting action. The first device consists of two ferrite cores and a permanent magnet which is sandwiched between the two saturated cores and it is called Magnetic Current Limiter. Experimental results with the MCL in circuit are discussed. Both field and thermal models of the MCL have been simulated using finite element software, FEMLAB. The demonstration of the High Temperature Superconductor Fault Current Limiter (HTSFCL) in power systems has been explained. The MATLAB simulation of the HTSFCL has been done and the results with and without the fault are shown. Power System Analysis Toolbox (PSAT) software has been used to locate the optimum or the best location of HTSFCL in a nine bus system. It has been shown that it is possible to find a solution that limits the fault current in power systems. Depending on the size of the system, either the MCL or the HTSFCL can be implemented. The location of the HTSFCL is to be carefully selected to achieve optimum results.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">current limiting devices</field><field name="subject">Passive Magnetic Current Limiter</field><field name="subject">High Temperature Superconductor Fault Current Limiter</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depression, the internet and ethnography : a study of online support forums and the methodology used : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for a Master of Arts degree in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany Campus</field><field name="creator">Hawkey, Michael Andrew</field><field name="description">Depression is one of the more common forms of mental illness experienced by people around the world. It is an illness which affects both men and women alike and does not target specific ages or nationalities. Depression is also an illness many suffer in solitude, often unable to pinpoint what exactly is wrong, rather identifying it as a &#8220;darkness&#8221; or sense of &#8220;numbness&#8221;. As we move into an age of growing technological changes, the Internet has become host to many forms of communities. These communities can be both modified versions of their offline original or whole new communities that did not exist to any great degree before the introduction of the internet. One such new form of online community are those designed for the support of peoples with depression and other mood disorders. Because of this growth in online communities and anthropology&#8217;s tradition of researching and understanding different groups of people, it is only appropriate that, as a discipline, it also moves online alongside these new communities. To do this, traditional field methods need to be reassessed and new potential problems and ethical dilemmas resolved. As online depression communities and internet ethnography are both relatively new fields of study, this thesis will examine the elements of both the online depression communities being studied, and the methods used in researching them. The reason I chose to research this topic is because, although depression as a subject has been covered many times before, and online community research is growing, there have been few studies undertaken on the two combined. In undertaking such research, this study will be of use for both academia and the public mental health sector. Academically, it provides us with an additional study venturing into online iii research and how to apply our tools within it. For the mental health sector, it provides an account as to how and why people with mental health issues deal with their problems, or at least begin to deal with them. This is important, as in the mental health sector many people with a mental illness may not reach out for help until in dire need. With the growth of online communities people may join earlier in their suffering and this knowledge could be of use for departments of mental health.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">online communities</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential on-time performance improvements at the Lufthansa Station at Frankfurt Airport : a human factors approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Aviation at Massey University, Auckland (Albany), New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Speri, Joerg</field><field name="description">Departure punctuality has increasingly gained attention over the last few years. This development is due to the realization what important role this issue plays in the economics of the airline industry. Punctuality is not just a sound performance indicator but also allows airlines to differentiate themselves from their competitors. In addition the issue holds a significant potential for cost savings. For this reason many airlines have started special programmes to improve their punctuality performance, and so did Lufthansa. However, despite this increasing attention, outbound punctuality levels have not yet reached satisfactory levels. Therefore, this study aimed at contributing to this process by identifying potential ontime performance improvements at the Lufthansa station at Frankfurt Airport. As an underlying framework, a Human Factors approach was chosen. Central issues in the focus of the study were the individual perceptions and attitudes towards punctuality by the relevant front line staff. In order to examine these issues a survey among the Flight Managers, Assistant Flight Managers, and Section leaders was carried out. The results of this survey were then put into correlation with the delay statistics published. The results of the survey indicate a potential lack of communication among the front line staff as well as between them and higher organizational entities. Moreover, certain distrust towards the delay statistics became evident. Although the staff members seem quite well motivated, they feel a lack of commitment by their superiors. In addition, the survey gathered some interesting ideas for punctuality improvements held by the front line staff members. Besides very concrete topics for discussion, the central outcome of the study was the recommendation to analyze all relevant processes at the Lufthansa station from a Human Factors perspective in order to improve the communicative situation. Moreover, the study suggests introducing appropriate incentive schemes in order to promote better on-time performance. Altogether these should result in a noticeable improvement of the punctuality situation at the Lufthansa station.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">airline industry</field><field name="subject">Lufthansa</field><field name="subject">departure</field><field name="subject">punctuality</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350400 Transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/619</field></doc></add>
